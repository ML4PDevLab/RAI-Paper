https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2012-01-08-no-monkeying-around-with-this-diet/,"FEELING a bit flabby after Christmas? Could do with losing a few kilograms?
If so, take a leaf out of the book of a fat orang-utan from Johannesburg who has lost a quarter of her body weight in a strictly controlled diet.
Gone are sweets, marshmallows, cakes, jelly and all things bad. In has come a healthy diet of fruit, vegetables and plenty of exercise, which has seen her weight drop from 100kg to 75kg in just 16 months.
Tubby orang-utan Oshine was placed on the strict diet in the UK after arriving at the Monkey World sanctuary from her previous home in Johannesburg in August 2010, where she had been kept as a pet for 12 years.
As well as the healthy lifestyle, 14-year-old Oshine has been encouraged to swing around her enclosure and be more active, playing with baby orang-utans for the first time in her life.
Dr Alison Cronin, director of Monkey World in Dorset, England, said the O-diet had made a slimmed-down Oshine a happier primate, but also reduced health risks familiar to overweight humans.
She said: ""Oshine is fantastic and more active than she's ever been. She lost a quarter of her body weight, but could probably still do with losing another 20kg to get to her ideal weight.
""When she was in South Africa she did get her five food groups of fruit and veg, protein etcetera, but she was also given the biscuits, cakes and sweet stuff which, coupled with a lack of exercise, saw her weight increase.
""Like in humans, that increases the risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems and diabetes, so it was important to get the weight down. Being morbidly obese also causes fertility issues and one day we'd like to see Oshine pregnant.""
Oshine was born in a zoo in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, but was given to a Johannesburg couple - whom Monkey World declined to identify - as a baby to raise as a pet. She grew up in the house wearing clothes and was much loved, said Cronin.
However, at age seven she became difficult to keep inside and the family built an enclosure for her. But with little exercise and a poor diet her weight ballooned until they could not cope and contacted Monkey World in 2008.
Two years later Oshine made the 10-and-a-half-hour flight from Johannesburg to London inside a specially adapted crate.
Now, said Cronin, she is enjoying life at the sanctuary, scaling 20m climbing frames and hanging from her toes and even adopting an orphaned baby orang-utan named Silvestre.
""I suppose the moral of the story is that ... this wasn't a faddy diet. This was a well-balanced diet with plenty of exercise. She'll never be some skinny, Twiggy model but she can be happy at her ideal weight and live an active life,'' Cronin said.",No monkeying around with this diet

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2012/1/7/jamaica-to-cut-ties-with-british-monarchy,"New prime minister says country will establish itself as a republic and break ties with former colonial power.
Jamaica’s new prime minister has said that it is time for her country to cut ties with the British monarchy and declare itself an independent republic.
Speaking at her inaugural address on Friday, Portia Simpson Miller, said her government would “initiate the process of detachment from the monarchy”, establishing a republic with a president as head of state, and breaking off links with the former colonial power.
Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy and also a Commonwealth realm.
“I love the Queen. She’s a beautiful lady and apart from being a beautiful lady a wise lady and a wonderful lady. But I think time come,” Simpson Miller said.
Currently under Jamaica’s constitution, Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state, and the prime minister is formally appointed by the governor-general, who represents the queen.
The announcement comes ahead of celebrations to mark 50 years of the country’s independence from the UK.
Economic crisis
Simpson Miller, taking over for her second term as prime minister, won a landslide victory in an election last week that largely pivoted on public discontent with Jamaica’s ailing economy and massive debt.
The unemployment rate currently stands at about 13 per cent, up from under 10 per cent in 2007, when the centre-right Jamaica Labour Party, the previous ruling party, won power.
Its public debt stands at $18.6bn of gross domestic product.
“In the short and medium term, we will use all state resources to stimulate employment through the Jamaica Emergency Employment Program,” Simpson Miller said after taking the oath of office.
“We will do so in a transparent and non-partisan manner.”
Nearly half of all Jamaicans (43 per cent) live under the poverty line of $2.50 per day, according to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) report.
Reaching a new agreement with the IMF on Jamaica’s debt is one of the new government’s top priorities, Omar Davies, the official in charge of the transition, told reporters on Wednesday.
New talks with the global lender are set to begin on Monday, with Jamaica represented by Peter Phillips, the country’s new finance minister. Phillips has held several cabinet posts in previous administrations.
In the December 28 election, Simpson Miller’s People’s National Party secured 41 seats, two-thirds of the total, in the House of Representatives.

Security has been stepped up after a night of rioting in Dakar left one policeman dead.
The unrest was the result of the decision by the country’s highest court allowing Wade to run for president a third time, despite the constitution only allowing two terms. Wade argues his first term began a year before the constitutional amendment limiting the number of times in office.
Friday started peacefully enough with the president’s opponents, including famous singer Youssou N’Dour, holding a rally as they waited for the court’s decision.
N’Dour’s candidacy has been rejected because the judges ruled he did not get the necessary 10,000 signatures, but the singer said he would appeal the decision.
Wade has made a number of changes to the constitution since he came to power in 2000, including shortening presidential terms from seven years to five, then changing them back to seven.

https://www.deccanherald.com/content/222564/toroloco-outguns-opposition.html,"Irfan Ghatala won his second straight Bangalore Winter Derby as his ward Toroloco romped home in the season’s biggest event on a rather sober day at the Bangalore Turf Club on Friday.
PS Chouhan piloted the Vikram and Nirmal Singh-owned colt brilliantly over the straight to take home the cash prize of Rs 32,70,000. Outside bet Nearness Of You, trained by S Padmanabhan, came in second while Hyderabad horse Golden Rule (Stephane Pasquier up) took third. Favourites Forever Glory (CD Hayes up) and Maddox, steered by YS Srinath, disappointed the punters, finishing fourth and fifth respectively.
“It was a really slow run race and my only worry was if Toroloco would get caught up in the middle bunch and get clipped,” an elated Ghatala, who won last year with Sun Kingdom, said after the race. “But Chouhan rode him well and I’m really happy with the victory.” Toroloco won in a time of 2:35.35.
After the first five races were completed on a sleepy Derby day, Ganapathy-trained Forever Glory and Neil Darashah-ward Maddox, expectedly, opened up as the two favourites.
Forever Glory was the first favourite with odds of 5/2 while Maddox was not far behind at 17/4. Toroloco was not being heavily backed, doubts over the colt’s ability to stay the distance leading to him closing on 8/1. Ghatala’s other horse in the field, Zultanite, showed better odds of 6/1.
Pacesetter Gold Venture, the stablemate of Forever Glory, took up the running with Maddox and Absolut Grey tucking in right behind. Forever Glory was nicely placed in fourth while Toroloco was running sixth.
As the horses reached the halfway mark, the positions hardly differed, the favourites waiting for the final bend to make their move.
That move came right at the straight, with Summer Derby winner Srinath urging Maddox on. CD Hayes also made his move on Forever Glory and it looked as if it was going to be a straight shootout between the favourites as the pacesetters fell behind. But with 800 metres to go, Toroloco and Golden Rule made their move on the outside, the former putting on a brilliant burst to pull away from the middle group.
Soon after, any doubts about Toroloco not being able to stay the distance were immediately banished when the colt not only caught up effortlessy with the front pack, but coasted past Golden Rule and Maddox to take the lead which he would not relinquish. Nearness Of You (David Allan up), Golden Rule and Forever Glory finished together with the Padmanabhan ward taking second, a head ahead of Golden Rule but a massive three-and-a-half lengths behind the winner. Golden Rule, trained by Leo D’Silva, beat out Forever Glory to third by a short head.
“I think the biggest thing that went our way today was the pace of the race. It was perfect,” Chouhan observed. “I had absolutely no doubts about his staying power. I had ridden him in a mock race over the same distance and he showed no problems.
“The only thing that worried me was getting caught up in traffic. But the moment I told my horse to go for it, he galloped away and the result was never in doubt after that,” the Summer Season’s champion jockey added.

The state power monopoly, the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo), awarded a nine billion birr project to the Metal and Engineering Corporation of Ethiopia (MetEC) to fully replace the existing post and pre paid electric meters with new “smart” meters, imported from India.
The two parties are in discussion to start planting the smart cards throughout the country. Based on the deal MetEC will replace the old, analogue meters that are read manually once every three months with new and digital smart meters that automatically capture information about electricity consumption and transmit it back to EEPCo.
According to sources, the metal corporation, formed by a collection of seven industries under the Ministry of Defence, already employed about 2,000 workers that will replace the existing meters with the new smart ones.
The employees who install the meters will be paid per piece installed in every household. EEPCo has almost two million registered customers throughout the country.
Misikir Negash Public Relations Head of the Corporation said that the two parties are working on the details of the procedures. “Apart from that I cannot give you further details about the project because it is in its early stage,” Misikir added.
Smart Meters are different than pre paid ones because they have real-time sensors, power outage notification capability and power quality monitoring, which utilizes two-way communication between the meter and the central system. They can also be used as water meters.
In 2007 EEPCo announced that it completed preparation to replace all the existing post paid meters with pre paid ones. To accomplish this, EEPCo established Electrometer, a prepaid electric meter manufacturing company in 2008 with Elsewedy an Egyptian electric cable company. Electrometer was established with 88.2 million birr. It has a capacity of producing 20,000 prepaid electric meters annually.
Recently, MetEC also agreed with the state monopoly, to produce the power factor correctors, a device that ensures the efficient use of power. It will be installed in all industries in the country in the coming year. The metal corporation is also undertaking the electromechanical work of the Great Renaissance Dam project that is under construction by Salini Consturttori, an Italian construction firm, at a cost of 4.8 billion dollars.
EEPCo requires a whooping 182.2 billion birr for power generation, transmission and distribution system expansion to achieve objectives envisioned in the country’s five year governing economic plan, the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) that will be completed by 2015. From a total amount of envisioned budget, the biggest share of 122.8 billion birr will be committed to constructing dams and harnessing other power generation schemes such as geothermal, wind and solar powers.",EEPCo to replace all meters with smart ones

Education opportunities, democratic governments or strong rule of law.”So in 2050, the number one and number three economies of the world will have — among others — one thing in common: they will both share a border with Pakistan. We, therefore, are in an enviable position, and ideally placed to leverage this huge geographical bonanza.Now let’s return to 2012. Political uncertainty blankets the country like a thick smog . The economy is in shambles. Human development indices are nose-diving and Millennium Development Goals are already beyond reach. Social sectors like education and health are groaning under the burden of criminal neglect while the population growth is outstripping GDP growth. And how concerned is the leadership?Well, the Senate elections next month appear to be the ultimate high for the government . Then if all goes well (sic), we will have a politically-popular but economically-ruinous budget, followed possibly by general elections. A fractured coalition government will return, and we will be back to where we were.There is a clear disconnect between 2012 and 2050 when it comes to Pakistani leadership. A disconnect borne of living for the moment and being a willing hostage to personal, familial and political vested interests. On paper, Pakistan is a lucky country and has all the ingredients to become a regional powerhouse by 2050. A youthful population offering the economic fruits of a demographic dividend, sufficient natural resources waiting to be exploited, a growing middle class unencumbered by the pitfalls of a backward and medieval feudal mindset, a rapid rate of urbanisation and endless possibilities to reap the advantage of proximity to the world’s largest and third-largest economies.What more could any country want.Well actually, a leadership with its head screwed on right. A leadership which realises Pakistan requires a strategic reorientation to leap forward and rise to its potential. A leadership which recognises we require peace with all our neighbours and by peace I don’t mean just an absence of war, but real peace which spurs free trade, social harmony and cultural cooperation.There’s a brave new world waiting for us 38 years from now. It is there for us. But more so for our children, who today are learning how to ride that green Sohrab bicycle.Thirty-eight years is a long time. But not really.Published in The Express Tribune, February 5, 2012.",Time flies when you are standing still

https://www.scmp.com/article/992480/never-twain-shall-meet,"""To many in the West, though fewer in Hong Kong and Asia, China's rise is moving roughly according to plan. The forces unleashed by Deng Xiaoping's reforms have created an increasingly free-market economy, albeit with some unwanted legacies, such as the tendency of Chinese companies to receive state support or steal intellectual property. For most observers in Europe and America, though, the path is broadly established, even if those who understand China a little better think that nothing could be further from the truth. One of the rather odd, even amusing, assumptions which follows is that China is also progressing, albeit gradually, towards a Western-style democratic system of governance, even although the government in Beijing has never declared that intention, and there seems little domestic interest in such a transition. Most of the enthusiasm for  this sort of reform seems to come from Chinese dissidents, or Western commentators. These false assumptions have allowed another consequence of China's rise to be overlooked. Western beliefs that China will gradually adopt concepts of democracy and laissez-faire economics also assume that the country will embrace Western ways of thinking. They assume that China will accept Western social values, and Western ideas of morality, too. Unfortunately for those sitting in Washington or Brussels, nothing could be further from the truth. The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights states that individuals are born free and equal. It reflects Western and European  Enlightenment notions of freedom and democracy. It says everyone has the right to work, to enjoy leisure time, the right to clothing and shelter, education and health care. But this is not how things  work in China, which has not signed the declaration, nor in most Asian countries, many of which view  such ideas as soft-headed  nonsense - the products of  warped post-imperialist minds. Chinese societies do not think about rights and society the way the West does. As a rule, they mistrust individual freedoms and political liberalism, preferring to emphasise order and discipline instead. Citizens are expected to sacrifice Western notions of freedom, including freedom of expression and freedom to congregate, for the good of society. There is little interest in Western democracy because it does not fit with Confucian ideas of stability, harmony and control. Many of China's most cherished philosophies are based on other ideas - on those of filial piety, respect for authority, a strong  work ethic, a desire for education and thrift. It is these differences in philosophy that have made it  hard for many foreign companies  to do business in China over the  past 20 years. Chinese work practices reflect a fundamentally different way of thinking. Mainland Chinese businesses view the protection of data, workers and property in another light. Their approach to the environment and to working hours is often totally at odds with those of European and US companies. Promoting staff on merit, for example, runs counter to a system that prefers to protect the interests of a family or an established social group. What the Westerner sees as corrupt, many Chinese see as fair business practice, even necessary. Respect for the law is often scant, especially if regulation is weak. Chinese job applicants often think nothing of presenting fake qualifications to get a job, just as local managers are happy to falsify company accounts or transfer corporate assets to their families. Responding to such practices, which were unfamiliar to Western businesses when they arrived, has become just another part of the formula needed to do business in China. Foreign managers have also discovered that many of these work practices have existed in China since the time of Confucius. Even so, Western commentators still seem to believe that Chinese values will change as the country takes a bigger role on the world stage, that businesses will adopt something akin to Western  ideas of morality when they move abroad. However, evidence from China's foreign adventures  suggests otherwise. Most overseas investments by Chinese companies have been in less-developed countries so far, notably in Africa. These suggest that Chinese firms have taken their domestic ideas and management practices with them. In a report on Chinese investments in Africa, researchers found the relationship with Africa was simply a 'classical colonial exchange', with mainland firms on the continent exporting raw materials from Africa and importing consumer goods from China to sell there. The study said that cheap finished products from China undercut those produced by African companies, pushing them out of business, bringing few benefits to local economies. Employees of overseas Chinese companies say they rarely receive contracts. The benefits they are legally entitled to are often not paid. Labour laws are routinely flouted. Women are typically dismissed if they become pregnant. Workers are not paid if they become ill or are injured. Many of those working in mines are given the option to buy their own safety equipment or go without. Local African newspapers claim that 18th-century plantation slaves worked shorter hours  than those working for modern Chinese firms. The arrival of many Chinese workers in Africa has led to an increase in elephant poaching,  while thousands of local workers have been displaced by Chinese immigrants in Kenya, Angola and Malawi, creating unemployment. China has also been accused of environmental damage in much of Africa, especially Mozambique, South Sudan and Equatorial  Guinea. Much of the local textile industry has been destroyed by low-cost Chinese imports. So, Chinese companies have hardly adapted their behaviour when they have moved abroad, nor paid much heed to local laws. They have been driven by the pursuit of reward and have retained their traditional business practices. For developed-world societies, the push by Chinese companies into their home territories is likely to bring trouble. For Western companies, to have experienced such unfamiliar work practices in China is one thing; to have to face them at home will be quite another. When the same companies reach the shores of America and Europe in large numbers, one side will have to change its ideas. At a time when developed-world governments face a prolonged period of low growth and high unemployment, they desperately need the inward investment that Chinese companies could offer. The question is: how much will they be willing to compromise on their values to get it? Graeme Maxton's latest book is The End of Progress, published by Wiley"",",Never the twain shall meet

https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/print/nobbs-makes-his-point/,"A day after former India skipper Rajpal Singh was dropped and senior player Arjun Halappa named as only a stand-by when the India mens hockey team for the Olympic qualifiers was announced,the team management,namely coach Michael Nobbs,said that the selectors had picked the best possible team and insisted that form and fitness and not reputation was the criteria.
Are you saying that we should pick players on reputation instead of fitness or form? The selection committee includes six people with a total experience of eight Olympics and a lot of experience. I think we know who deserves a spot, the India coach said addressing the media.
Ask the selectors
When asked specifically about Halappa and Singh being sidelined,Nobbs said that the selection committee had made a collective decision.
The selectors have unanimously decided to pick this team on the basis of current form and fitness… those who can win the game for us. My job is to show no favour to reputation. We have picked the best players,in-form players who can fit into the system and structure of the team, he said.
The selectors had made it clear that when it came to fitness they had gone by the coachs recommendation.
Nobbs was quick to add that he had no fitness issues regarding Halappa.
The India coach,however,rubbished Singhs claim that there was supposed to be a fitness test before the team for the Olympic qualifiers was to be announced. I dont agree (with Rajpal Singh). Fitness and form in the South Africa series were considered for selection, the India coach said.

The future of another senior player Gurbaj Singh isnt clear. Gurbaj,suffering from a knee injury,was left out of the squad though Nobbs had said that his fitness would be re-assessed before the team was announced.
Gurbaj is likely to arrive in Delhi on Wednesday.
He remains an important part of the teams plan and once he is fully fit,he will be back in the camp, Nobbs said.
Nobbs also refrained from commenting on whether players involvement with the World Series Hockey was a reason for their exclusion. He said that it was outside his area of concern. He also sidestepped questions on whether it was a big risk going into an important event like the qualifiers without enough experience in the ranks.

We need to support the young players and take some tough decisions. I dont like to drop players,it hurts. I myself was dropped as a player but then change is difficult and this is change. The youngsters are good enough, he said.
Captain Bharat Chhetri,meanwhile,said he was not part of the selection process. If you say those who are out were good,does it mean those are in are not good? Once the team is decided,a captains job is to lead the players who are there and manage them. I am not part of the selection process so I cant comment on that, he said.
Womens team announced
Meanwhile,Hockey India on Tuesday announced the 18-member womens squad for the qualifiers. Led by midfielder Asunta Lakra,the team features most of the players who played in the four-Test series against Azerbaijan early this month.
Joydeep Kaur,recovering from an injury sustained during the Australia tour last year,has been retained and will be joined by Jaspreet Kaur and Subhadra Pradhan in the defence line. India play Canada,Italy,Poland,South Africa and Ukraine for a shot at qualifying for London.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/india-s-big-hockey-switch/story-Y5AIg3Z6LMZtKlzMCjjQ9L.html,"While Hockey India (HI) continues to dismiss the threat of the World Series of Hockey (WSH), its former skipper, Rajpal Singh, has decided to join the 'league of rebels' and is all set to turn out for the Delhi Wizards.
Rajpal made up his mind on Monday, but another former skipper, Arjun Halappa, Vikram Pillay, Ravipal, Bharat Chikara and Dharamvir Singh had decided to move to the lucrative league the day HI announced the squad for Olympic Qualifiers a week back.
HT has learnt that nearly half of the 33 players, whose names have been submitted to the Sports Authority of India (SAI) for the London Olympic Games preparatory camp, have made up their mind to play in the WSH.
The exclusion of these players from the Qualifiers, coupled with the fact that HI was playing spoilsport by planning a camp in the middle of the Feb 29-April 4 League, was the proverbial last straw. ""HI's plan to organise the London Olympic Games camp from March 15 onwards, did not go down well with almost all the players contracted with the WSH and they made up their mind then and there,"" said an HI official.
Things now seem to be moving towards a vertical split, as HI is ready with a contingency plan in the event the national campers desert the federation for the Indian Hockey Federation and Nimbus Sports joint venture.
A senior HI selector said that a ""Plan B"" was ready and a lot of juniors would be blooded into the squad in the event of an en masse migration of players. ""HI knew that many national campers would join the rival league. That's why we prepared another list of the hockey probables, mostly juniors, for the national camp, in December-January last year,"" said the selector. ""We can't stop players (from migrating), but we can identify replacements. So, once we make it to the Olympics, our preparations will not be jeopardised."" This development could land the sport in a piquant situation as the team, which earns the country a quota place --- more or less a certainty - could well be replaced by a young and relatively inexperienced squad.
Top players out
Rajpal, who led the team to podium finish in the 2010 Commonwealth and Asian Games and in the inaugural Asian Champions Trophy, figures in the list of 33 probables submitted to SAI, but was dropped from the current squad on medical grounds. Seasoned campaigner, Arjuna Halappa, who was in the list of stand-bys for the Olympic Qualifiers currently underway, will captain the Karnataka Lions.
""The HI has decided that they do not require our services. So, we thought we'd better be part of WSH,"" said Ravipal, who was part of the India squad for both the CWG and the Asiad. ""We have always put country above self, but when it is clear that we will not be a part of the national team anymore, we decided not to miss the opportunity to play in front of the home crowd,"" he added.
""WSH is good for the sport. It will generate a huge investment,"" said Halappa. Yannick Colaco, Chief Operating Officer, Nimbus, said, ""We are all for hockey. Playing in the WSH gives players a chance to rub shoulders with the best and it will provide them monetary benefits.""
In a last ditch effort to stop players from switching over, HI has organised a camp till Feb 27 for the national campers not part of the current squad. ""We have asked the players to join their teams on Feb 28,"" said Colaco in response to the developments.

https://nation.africa/kenya/business/technology/state-steps-in-to-sharpen-software-developers-global-competitive-edge--802502,"Software developers in Kenya are poised to enjoy improved fortunes from a government-led initiative that aims to certify developers in Kenya and make them more competitive in the global market.
The software certification programme dubbed Chipuka was launched last month and is a partnership between the Kenya Government through the ICT Board and the Carnegie Mellon University, a US research university.
Under the certification programme, software developers in the country will be required to take an exam that will test their practical ability to create custom software solutions for a competitive market.
The move is an attempt to standardise the software development industry in Kenya and comes when IT managers in the country have expressed concern towards the quality of software developers in the country and their innovations.
Research findings from a study conducted last year by the Kenya ICT Board and the Internet Development Corporation, IDC found that 45 per cent of companies rate software developers as the most difficult professionals to find in the IT labour market.
This, despite the recent projection of software development skills to the second biggest growth segment in the IT labour market. In the next two years developers are set to experience 135 per cent more demand.
“Most of the companies we talked to told us that even after they employ new IT professionals, they have to spend up to 18 months training them,” says Andrew Lewela, ICT Board’s project manager for Chipuka.
Some companies find it a great inconvenience and a needless expense in time and money to re-train new employees who have spent between four to six years in college doing IT-related courses.
In that regard, a third of the companies indicate that they are going to contact external providers to fill the skill shortages. This presents a disadvantage to hundreds of IT graduates in the country who will find themselves locked out of plum IT jobs in the country.
Kenyan universities have as a result found themselves on the spot as industry players question their ability to churn out developers relevant to the needs of the Kenyan job market.
According to Enock Kiprono, CEO of Fenesi.com, a tech start-up that offers Internet solutions and business mentorship, Kenyan universities and colleges that offer IT related courses need to review their curriculum.
“Some of the information used to teach in our institutions of higher learning was developed several years ago and since technology keeps shifting rapidly, such information has become out-dated”, he says.
“The result is that you find job-seeking programmers and software analysts who are not up-to-speed on new technologies required in the market. They therefore find it difficult to secure high level IT positions in local firms as well as compete with their international peers.”
Some universities in Kenya have however managed to stay ahead of the curve and insist that their programmes are in line with industry requirements.
Strathmore University has a partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT that is now in its 10th year and seeks to provide transfer of skills in mobile tools and technologies.
Speaking at the recent Mobile Web East Africa, MWEA workshop held in Nairobi, Dr. Joseph Sevilla a senior ICT lecturer at Strathmore University and director of iLab Africa the university’s innovation lab presented a spirited pitch for the University’s partnership.
“Over 500 students have been trained on mobile apps development through the Strathmore MIT-AITI partnership programme,” said Dr Sevilla. “In addition to this, iLab Africa has developed a Masters course for mobile developers and currently, 90 students are undertaking an MSc in Telecommunication and innovation.”
The Kenya ICT Board states that its new certification programme should not be viewed as a no-confidence vote against similar initiatives by learning institutions in the country but rather as a practical standardisation gauge.
“We are aware that there are other certification programmes for software engineers in the country and that our local Universities also strive to make their graduates relevant and competitive in the job market”, explains Mr Lewela.
“Chipuka does not seek to compete with the existing certifying processes or educational institutions; we are merely seeking to offer software developers a hands-on process through which they can evaluate their prowess and competitiveness in a global market.”
“Universities and technology institutions are on board and they are partnering with us and in fact we are going to use them to administer these exams to their students.”
Under the Chipuka certification programme, IT graduates and software developers will sign up for accreditation exams similar to their counterparts in accounting who sign up for CPA or ACCA exams.
The exams will test candidates’ prowess in software development by giving them practical problems and the opportunity to solve them using an effective software solution.
The exam will be conducted online and the results received instantly upon completion. Successful candidates are then issued with a certificate indicating they are able to create relevant software solutions for the local and international market.
The ICT Board further states that the certification programme is not compulsory to software developers in the country as there have been very successful developers who have gone ahead and won recognition in the international market.
A pilot exam for Chipuka will be ready by March 2013 with the certification expected to be fully operational in Kenya by October 2013. It is however not clear how much the certification will cost individual candidates but the ICT Board has stated that the government could offer a subsidised fee.
Once operational, the programme is expected to make the local software industry more appealing to international investors who are already flocking local innovation hubs looking for bankable projects.
In addition to certifying local software developers and their products, the government last week announced a raft of incentives targeted at local software developers and firms who seek a regional presence.
Last week, information permanent secretary Dr. Bitange Ndemo stated that the government is considering removing the 30 per cent withholding tax levied on local software developers as part of its incentives to encourage investment in the sector.
“The government is working on policies to provide incentives like removing the 30 per cent withholding tax that is levied on local businesses being exported out of Kenya”, PS Ndemo said.
Dr. Ndemo was speaking at the Mobile Web East Africa, MWEA conference held in Nairobi’s Southern Sun Hotel last week.
According to Carey Eaton, the managing director of popular online classifieds website Cheki, Kenya compares poorly in terms of the cost of doing business in the ICT sector.
“As part of Vision 2030 the government is heavily investing in ICT, but there still remains an uncompetitive environment compared to other countries in as far as software licensing and taxation is concerned,” she said.
“For successful Internet or software companies with a pan-African vision, they have to make a decision where to base their operations. Currently if you base your IT department in Johannesburg or Mauritius, there are a lot of incentives provided by the governments to make doing pan-African business easy.”
Ms Eaton further adds that basing IT development in the country presents a two-fold disadvantage because of 30 per cent ‘deemed value’ of licensing to other countries. First, there is the 30 per cent tax and secondly, the equal ‘deemed value’ implies that KRA decides how much value your software is delivering.
“This forces IT firms to opt for the inconveniences of setting up outside Kenya and pay 10 per cent withholding tax and possibly reverse VAT on ‘importing’ the IT,” she explains.
“Alternatively you could choose to operate in Kenya and lose a 30 per cent price advantage compared to other countries if you expand internationally.”
If implemented, the waiver of the 30 per cent withholding tax levied on licensing fees will go a long way in reducing the operating costs for local software developers.",State steps in to sharpen software developers’ global competitive edge

At a programme organised by the District Tuberculosis Centre, K. Sundaralingam, Deputy Director, TB (in-charge), said that tuberculosis was curable and it should be diagnosed at the earliest.
In the past 10 years, after launching Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) in Tuticorin district, sputum test was done on 1.25 lakh people and about 22,000 were diagnosed with TB. Eighty percent of them were cured, Dr. Sundaralingam said. “Pulmonary TB is an airborne infectious disease. Every three minutes, two people die of TB. In India, about 20 lakh people are affected by TB every year. If a TB patient is left untreated, he or she spreads the infection to 10 to 15 people in a year”
Although Directly Observed Therapy Short course (DOTS) for TB patients was given free of cost by the Health department, nutritious food and high protein diet were essential for speedy recovery of TB patients, he added.
Meanwhile, Rotary Club of Tuticorin district has come forward to provide nutritional support to TB patients.
J. Nallathambi Gnana Thivagaran, Joint Director of Health Services, Tuticorin, said that TB patients must take the prescribed medicine for a period of six to eight months regularly. They should close their mouth while coughing and sneezing and not spit in public places.
If symptoms such as cough, expectoration, fever, decreased appetite, decreased weight and blood in sputum were noticed, they should approach the nearby primary health centre or government hospital and get tested for TB immediately, he added.
P. Subbiah, former Deputy Director, spoke. Dr. Thivagaran released an awareness audio and video CD. Xavier Motha, president, Rotary Club of Seaside, presented nutritional diet to the patients. Thulasiraman, Supervisor, proposed a vote of thanks.",Stress on early diagnosis of TB

http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-london-hotels-set-for-olympics-price-idUSLNE82D02S20120314,"(Reuters.com) - Room rates will more than double during this Summer’s Olympic Games, according to an annual Hotel Price Index.

The average cost of a London hotel room during this period will be 213 pounds a night, a 102 percent year-on-year increase, the survey found.
David Roche, president of Hotels.com which carried out the survey, told Reuters he would not be surprised if prices were pushed even higher, to a trebling of 2011 prices.
“Hoteliers like to hold back inventory and drip-feed it in, testing price elasticity. It remains to be seen what fraction of inventory is available,” he said.
This can be a gamble -- at last year’s royal wedding, says Roche, hotels got “caught red-handed” and ended up with lower occupancy.
Supply constraints have added to central London’s hotel price inflation. Of London’s 100,000 rooms, 40,000 were given to the Olympics organising committee LOCOG at below-market rates -- representing more than 600,000 room nights -- although LOCOG has given 20 percent of them back.
Roche stressed however that room rates are approximately where they were in December 2004. “Hotels on a relative basis are very cheap (despite) strong price growth for a few weeks this summer.”
To avoid the worst of central London’s price inflation, Roche recommends visitors seek out hotels in satellite towns as many Olympic events take place outside the city.
Ufi Ibrahim, chief executive of the British Hospitality Association, underlined that point, telling the BBC, “Don’t forget there are a further 75,000 rooms within an easy commute of the Olympic Park.”
Visitors are also advised to book early. Roche told Reuters there is significant interest in London from BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) this summer.
“Book early before a Russian gets it,” he said.
The hotel price index, now in its eighth year, is based on a sample of about 142,000 properties in over 85 countries. Global room rates increased by four percent in 2011, with increases in 69 of the 88 city or resort locations analysed.
Last year, prices fell 2 percent in Asia year-on-year but rose in all other areas: 8 percent in the Pacific, 5 percent in North America, 4 percent in Latin America, 3 percent in the Caribbean and 2 percent in Europe and the Middle East.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203753704577257473813219022,"Wireless carriers are getting increasingly forceful in their efforts to pitch mobile bandwidth as a scarce, valuable commodity—setting up a battle with consumer groups that support open-Internet rules and longtime customers who treasure their unlimited data plans.
Among U.S. carriers, AT&T Inc. T -0.79% is leading the charge. Its latest scuffle came on Friday, a day after the country's second-largest wireless company said its 17 million customers who subscribed to unlimited-data plans will see much slower speeds if they exceed a new monthly usage cap.
AT&T's new policy limiting high-speed wireless data usage has drawn a furious response from some customers, Anton Troianovski reports on digits. Photo: Getty Images.
""I pay for unlimited usage, and I'm not getting it,"" said Jordan Hackworth, an AT&T customer in Salem, Ore. ""Why would I stay with a carrier that doesn't respect that?""
For now, less than 5% of AT&T's smartphone customers exceed the new three-gigabyte monthly cap put in place by the carrier. But as wireless technology gets faster and data-heavy services like mobile video proliferate, the question of who pays the price for expensive networks—and how much the phone companies are able to profit from them—is increasingly taking center stage in the mobile industry.
AT&T has tried to put the onus on Washington, insisting that the push by antitrust enforcers and regulators to block the company's $39 billion takeover last year of rival carrier T-Mobile USA hurt its effort to bolster its network. AT&T said the deal would have given it more access to the wireless airwaves that carry mobile traffic and lashed out at regulators after the deal was killed in December.
AT&T plans to cap high-speed data in its unlimited monthly plans. Associated Press
""In a capacity-constrained environment, usage-based data plans, increased pricing, managing the speeds of the highest volume users—these are all logical and necessary steps to manage utilization,"" Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said in a January conference call with analysts.
Critics and government officials argue AT&T can improve its network by investing in more infrastructure and making better use of its wireless spectrum. And AT&T and other wireless carriers caught a break in Washington last month after Congress approved new auctions of spectrum currently held by television broadcasters.
The broader problem for AT&T and other wireless carriers is that even as smartphones boom, other companies—from hardware and software makers like Apple Inc. to the app developers and Internet companies who make money from mobile services—are managing to extract a lot of the profits from the mobile ecosystem.
That is why earlier this week AT&T floated another way it can get paid: by charging app developers and content providers for the data their products use, in exchange for making the wireless delivery of those apps and videos free to consumers. In an interview, an AT&T executive pitched the product as toll-free calling for the mobile-broadband world and said the company hoped to roll out the service next year. Critics said such an offering would shift the playing field of the mobile Web, hampering cash-strapped start-ups trying to compete with established players that have the cash to pay AT&T.
Around the world, mobile carriers have started to experiment with offering unlimited access to a select few websites, such as Twitter and Facebook, while charging for the rest of the Web. In the U.S., many carriers have mounted a big push to charge customers more for the more data they use.
Verizon Wireless, the largest national carrier, and T-Mobile USA, the fourth-biggest, both only sell plans that limit customers to a certain amount of high-speed mobile data per month.
Sprint Nextel Corp. , the third-biggest wireless carrier, is now the only national carrier that still sells an unlimited plan—so dissatisfaction over AT&T's move this week could help it win more subscribers.
Joe Philipson, an AT&T user in Rochester, N.Y., is considering returning to Sprint even though he said he had a bad customer-service experience with the carrier when he left, disgruntled, about six years ago.
""I might have to go make a deal with the devil,"" he said.
The reason he may switch back: Mr. Philipson, 27, doesn't want to worry about going over a data cap as he listens to streaming music on his iPhone or uses it to watch Netflix video when on a bus or train.
Sprint struggled for years with a reputation for poor service but has won much better reviews recently, evidenced by a sharp drop in the percentage of customers leaving the carrier each quarter.
A spokesman said Sprint would welcome more customers, even ones who guzzle data.
Mr. Philipson's comments echoed those of many angry consumers who criticized AT&T on Facebook and Twitter on Friday. Some, however, were more conciliatory, arguing that customers in the smartphone age should no longer expect to be use lots of wireless data without paying for it.
Some commentators saw AT&T's new policy as more generous than its previous policy, under which it slowed Internet use for the top 5% of unlimited data users in individual markets. That vague limit sometimes resulted in users seeing their Web-surfing slowed after they had only used around two gigabytes of data.
""We're hearing from customers that they appreciate the clarity that only those who use 3GB or more of data—less than 5% of smartphone customers—are impacted,"" AT&T spokesman Brad Burns said.

Jain community had gifted the “kalasha” after the circle was named after Mahaveera during his 2006 birth anniversary, according to a letter the Mangalore Jain Society wrote to the Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada and the Commissioner of Mangalore City Corporation on March 1, 2012.
The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has sought shifting the “kalasha” to pave the way for the flyover as part of widening the stretch between Nanthoor and Talapady under phase III of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP). Official sources told The Hindu that the society, after initial hesitation, agreed to shift the circle with “kalasha” last month to a nearby vacant land (near a police outpost built by Rotary Club). But the stakeholders are yet to reach a consensus.
In its letter the society president L.D. Ballal and secretary Pushparaj Jain said: “…We are informed that the proposals (of shifting the circle) are acceptable to the NHAI subject to approval by the revenue and the city corporation authorities and payment of suitable compensation by the NHAI…”
They requested both the authorities to permit the society to shift the circle.
“…We are willing to make our own arrangements for shifting the circle as per the approved plan and for its maintenance as it is now being maintained by the Karnataka Bank Ltd.,” the letter concluded.
Deputy Commissioner N. S. Channappa Gowda told The Hindu that the NHAI was requested to modify the flyover plan by increasing its height to avoid shifting the Kalasha and by additional vent to allow B.C. Road-Mangalore traffic, a proposal which has also got the backing of Mangalore City (South) MLA N. Yogish Bhat.
“We will have one more meeting with the NHAI to sort out the issue,” Mr. Gowda said.
Mr. Bhat told The Hindu that building the flyover should be the first priority not the retaining the “kalasha” as it was not an ancient monument.
There was no point in shifting it to the vacant land nearby as the corporation might need the space for other public utility purposes.
Mr. Jain said the society was not willing to install the “kalasha” in any other circle in the city. P. N. Gawasane, Project Director, NHAI told The Hindu that NHAI would begin the works on flyover shortly based on the letter by the society.
If obstructed, the NHAI might drop the flyover from its scope of project.",'Kalasha' issue hits Pumpwell Circle flyover plan

https://www.deccanherald.com/content/240712/cong-manifesto-scores-over-bjp.html,"The Congress manifesto for municipal elections, released on Saturday, has an edge over the one released by BJP on Sunday.
It scores over BJP for two reasons mainly.
First, Congress has marked out specific colonies and specific development projects for these colonies/areas ranging from building hospitals, maternity homes, flyovers, parkings, underpasses etc. Second, the party in its manifesto has added a chapter – Five Years Mis-Rule of BJP in Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) wherein it highlighted 31 points on which BJP failed to deliver or is “making a false claim”.
No such thing in the BJP manifesto — a seven-page document with general promises made for the entire Delhi.
In the three separate manifestos for each municipality, the Congress has mentioned more than 300 area-specific projects and clearly has an edge over BJP in terms of being more aware about the problems faced by people in particular areas and being more honest in making promises to these people if voted to power. BJP has taken no such chance.
Sample this. The Congress, in its manifesto for North Delhi Municipal Corporation says that it will open a new polyclinic in Uttam Nagar, homoeopathic dispensary in Aya Nagar, build multi-level parking in Hauz Rani village and Malviya Nagar, will construct an underpass from IIT to Adchini, improve Palam-Dabri Road, cover Pankha Road drainage etc.
However, when it comes to BJP’s manifesto, it is evident the party has not taken the trouble to know the requirement and demands of people in various places or colonies.
“We shall construct more than 100 parking lots in Delhi, we will construct public conveniences near main roads and markets, Delhi Corporations will plant herbal and medicinal trees in parks and all parts of Delhi, community centres will be modernised etc”reads the BJP manifesto.
While a manifesto is usually about the ideals and principles for which the party stands and promises it makes to the people during elections, the Congress in its document did not shy from attacking the Opposition BJP.
The Congress manifesto blames BJP for illegal constructions in Delhi which led to building collapses and death of over hundreds of people in last five years besides pointing out several projects that the party has announced and not been taken up till date.",Cong manifesto scores over BJP

https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/rs-may-take-up-lokpal-bill-next-week/,"Hopes of a consensus on the Lokpal Bill seem to have brightened with the government on Thursday reaching out to the Opposition and other parties and signalling its willingness to rework contentious clauses,including letting states decide on the Lokayukta,making the panel appointing or removing Lokpal more balanced,and bringing foreign funded NGOs under its ambit.
Government managers on Thursday suggested that the Bill could be taken up in the Rajya Sabha next week,depending on the narrowing down of differences with Leader of Opposition and other parties. As part of the exercise,Union ministers Kapil Sibal,Salman Khurshid,Pawan Kumar Bansal and V Narayanasamy met Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley and discussed the issues on which the two sides had not been able to find common ground.
The BJP had sought amendments in two key areas  the process of appointment and removal of Lokpal in which it wanted to ensure that government-appointed nominees do not tilt the balance in governments favour,and keeping the CBI out of government control. UPA sources signalled that the two amendments were under active consideration.
Government managers indicated that the Centre could either consider the option of keeping Lokayukta out of the Lokpal Bill and let the states decide or propose a model law to be passed by Parliament that could enable them to create their own Lokayukta.
The government turnaround had been indicated much earlier after states like West Bengal had opposed the Lokayukta clause in the Bill.
The Left,with whom government representatives are likely to meet on Friday,had demanded that foreign-funded NGOs be brought under Lokpal. We would like the Bill to come to the RS only after there is a consensus. If the Bill is brought and then consensus is sought,it would lead to certain problems, Khurshid said.",RS may take up Lokpal Bill next week

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/197647/de-venecia-sues-telecommunications-companies-over-high-messaging-rates,"A Quezon City court has ordered the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) and three telecommunications companies to answer a damage suit filed by businessman Jose “Joey” de Venecia III in connection with their failure to comply with the reduced fees for interconnected text messages.
Judge Ralph Lee of QC Regional Trial Court Branch 83 has directed the NTC, Globe Telecoms Inc., Smart Communications Inc. and Digitel Communications Inc. to submit their answers within 10 days.
ADVERTISEMENT
In an order dated May 17, the court set the first hearing on De Venecia’s petition on May 23 at 10 a.m.
Last week, De Venecia lodged a civil case and asked the court to stop the telcos from charging more than 80 centavos for interconnected texts in light of an NTC memorandum setting the interconnection fee at 15 centavos.
Writ of mandamus
He also sought a writ of mandamus to compel the NTC to “promptly resolve” the issue of the 15-centavo fee being challenged by telcos.
De Venecia, son of former Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr., also asked to be awarded at least P2,000 a month retroactive to December 2011 “due to the illegal collection of more than 80 centavos per interconnected SMS.”
This is apart from the P100,000 in exemplary damages that the petitioner is seeking “for the good of the public.”
De Venecia asked for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to stop the respondents from imposing text messaging rates higher than 80 centavos.
The civil suit was based on an NTC memorandum on Oct. 24, 2011, regulating interconnection rates for text messages at a rate not higher than 15 centavos per message.
Prior to the ruling, the interconnection charge imposed by telcos was 35 centavos.
ADVERTISEMENT
De Venecia said the new fees were supposed to take effect on Nov. 30, 2011, but the telcos still continued to charge P1 for each text message sent to rival couriers.
Motion to dismiss
After receiving complaints from subscribers, the NTC issued a show cause order directing the telcos to explain their failure to lower their text messaging rates by at least 20 centavos.
The three telecommunication firms then filed a motion to dismiss before the NTC, citing lack of jurisdiction due to deregulation.
De Venecia pointed out that under the law, the NTC, despite deregulation, “retains the residual power to fix rates where there is a cartel or combination in restraint of trade, where free competition does not exist or does not function well and the public is affected.” Julie M. Aurelio

Attorney general Patrick Atkinson is challenging the validity of the law under which the Office of the Contractor General (OCG) is seeking to get information from the independent oversight panel set up to monitor three government projects.
The panel was set up to monitor the North-South Link of Highway 2000 Project, the Gordon Cay Container Trans-Shipment Hub Project, and the Fort Augusta Container Terminal Project.
But the contractor General Greg Christie has objected to the panel claiming the government is seeking to circumvent his office.
And Christie has requisitioned the panel requesting that it routinely submit to the OCG, formal written reports outlining particulars of its oversight activities regarding the three projects.
But the OCG says despite being given two extensions the panel is yet to respond to its requisition.
And it says the attorney general has now written to the OCG to challenge the validity of the law under which the OCG is seeking to monitor the panel.
Atkinson has reportedly said he does not agree that the OCG has the power to requisition the panel and will be seeking to have the matter resolved by the Supreme Court by way of a judicial review.
But the OCG is insisting it has acted lawfully and says the Administration’s latest move is an abuse of the judicial process and an obvious delay tactic.
The OCG says it has secured the services of Queen’s Counsel Jacqueline Samuels-Brown, and will, soon advise of its intended course of action in response to this latest development.

The dead has been identified as Narasimha, 28, a resident of Kalidasa Layout, Srinagar. The identity card found in the trouser pocket helped identify the body.
His family members learnt about the suicide through electronic media in the afternoon.
Narasimha’s parents – Narasimha Murthy, a carpenter and Ramakka – were inconsolable when they reached the spot. Ramakka collapsed on seeing the body. Narasimha’s wife Shwetha is eight months pregnant. They had married last year. Narasimha was working as a medical representative at a private company, Mahaveer Pharmaceuticals, in Chamarajpet.
Raju, a cousin of Narasimha told Deccan Herald that the family was shocked at Narasimha’s decision to end his life specially when he was expecting his baby in a month’s time. Narasimha had met with a bike accident two months ago and suffered fracture in the leg. He took a long leave from work and had still not rejoined duty. Though he was cured almost a month ago, he had told his family that he was on ESI leave. “Now that he has committed suicide, we feel that he faced some problem at his office or he may have lost his job,” Raju said.
People at the busy Visvesvaraya Towers were shocked to see the man fall to death from the terrace of the 22-storey building. Before they could realise what was happening, Narasimha came crashing down and fell on an SUV parked in front of the main entrance.
The impact was so severe that the roof of the SUV had a big dent and the windshields were shattered to pieces. As he fell down, his leg got severed after it hit a platform on the second floor. The leg was thrown to a distance of about 30 feet near the road. The Cubbon Park police immediately took the body to Bowring Hospital.",Man jumps to death from VV Towers

In renewed rescue efforts by the community, the blue whale that was stranded in the Mannavaram swamp off Siruthalaikadu in Vedaranyam was set free into the deep sea, here on Sunday.
This was after the day-long efforts to drift the whale away from the swamp and into the open waters stood foiled, as the whale retreated deeper into the swamp on Saturday night.
The four-tonne, 25-feet long blue whale was initially found stranded at about dawn on Saturday in the Mannavaram swamp a few kilometres south west off Kodiakarai coast.
The stranded whale was rescued manually from the swamp only to be let off into the open waters in the channel that branched off the lagoon.
However, the mammal, bereft of any injuries, had later drifted deeper into the swamp in the night, rendering futile the day-long rescue operation staged by the forest department.
However, just after dawn on Sunday, rescue operations were renewed —this time on the initiative of the community. In order to ensure that the whale did not retreat to the swamp, the mammal was hauled out slowly with ropes, drifted off the lagoon and led up to a depth of seven feet into the sea.
“The whale had moved about 800 meters further into the swamp and we had to ensure that the mammal was hauled out slowly with the use of ropes, in order to pull it farther into the sea,” said P.V.R. Vivek, a wild life photographer, who initiated the renewed efforts mobilising fishermen to the swamp.
The efforts paid off after the mammal swam back farther away from the brackish lagoon and into the deep sea. “We stood assured until we waited and watched the whale swim back into the sea for over a few hundred meters,” says Mr. Vivek.",Stranded blue whale let off into ocean at last

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oly-swim-swm2br-idUSBRE8701QL20120801,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hungary’s Daniel Gyurta was third-time lucky on Wednesday as he powered to gold in the 200 meters breaststroke, breaking a world record and denying host-nation Britain their first male swimming gold in almost a quarter of a century.
Hungary's Daniel Gyurta poses with his gold medal on the podium after winning the men's 200m breaststroke final with a world record during the London 2012 Olympic Games at the Aquatics Centre August 1, 2012. REUTERS/Jorge Silva
Propelled by a deafening roar inside London’s Aquatics Centre, Gyurta held on to beat Briton Michael Jamieson in a desperate finish, to win in a time of two minutes, 07.28 seconds.
Scotland’s Jamieson was just 0.15 seconds behind, after almost drawing level with Gyurta approaching the wall. Japan’s Ryo Tateishi, swimming in the outside lane, was third.
Three-time Olympian Gyurta had won silver in the 200 in Athens in 2004 at just 15, but then slipped to fifth in Beijing.
He has since bounced back with a storming four years, winning the last two European and two world championships.
“I managed to prove to everyone and to myself after those devastating two years after the 2004 Olympic Games that I could bounce back, and do what I dreamed of since my childhood,” said the visibly elated 23-year-old. “It is the biggest achievement of my life.”
In a race that pitted some of the greatest names in the stroke against newer arrivals, Gyurta shaved 0.03 off the record set by Australia’s Christian Sprenger at the 2009 world championships, when the now-banned bodysuits were still allowed.
Gyurta, his competitors said, had been the top challenger.
“His last 50 meters are consistently the fastest in the world,” Britain’s Jamieson said. “He’s been the man to beat over the last few years.”
The race did not go to plan, however, for the breaststroke veterans competing for a spot on the podium.
Australia’s Brenton Rickard finished seventh, while Japan’s Kosuke Kitajima ended almost a decade-long dominance of the stroke, missing out on his last crack at winning a fifth gold medal and on the elusive feat of becoming the first male swimmer to win the same individual event at three Olympics.
Kitajima, hugely popular in Japan, has dominated breaststroke since the 2003 world championships in Barcelona. He went on to win the breaststroke double at Athens in 2004 and Beijing four years later.
In London he had been locked in a race with Michael Phelps to become the first male swimmer to do the three-peat.
When Phelps failed to win a medal in the 400 medley on Saturday, Kitajima got the opportunity to become the first, but he missed the podium altogether in his own first event, the 100 breaststroke, only to miss it again in his second.
Phelps has two more opportunities this week, with the 100 fly and the 200 individual medley.

He then joked about how the channels would run ""breaking news"" about his ""threat"".
""I am sure these channels will be running ""Breaking News""... ""Raj Thackeray threatens to shut down Hindi news channels,"" he said, gesturing wildly with his hands, mocking the news channels.
Speaking about the cases filed against him and the coverage of it in the media, Thackeray claimed that he knew the law.
""Don't issue me threats claiming that you will file (criminal or defamation) cases against me. I know of several laws that are broken every now and then. Should I also go to court and sue those guilty,"" he questioned.
Lashing out at Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh's remark that Thackeray's family too came originally from Bihar, he said, ""Digvijay Singh says anything that comes to his mind, however irrelevant. He is someone the Congress keeps, to take the brunt of all criticism.""
Thackeray, in a slapstick manner, retorted to Singh's remark with a question: ""So is Digvijay Singh's family from Sulabh Shauchalay (public toilet)?""
Last week, Thackeray had called Biharis in Maharashtra ""infiltrators"" in reaction to reports of a letter from the Bihar chief secretary warning Mumbai Police against picking up suspects from the state without first informing local police.
""How come most offenders are from Bihar,"" Thackeray asked, adding that there was no need for Bihari politicians to teach Maharashtra the rules.
Bringing up the matter of the cinema wing of MNS's threat to disrupt shooting of a television programme featuring Pakistani artistes, Thackeray said he did not favour the inclusion of Pakistani performers.
""I stand by my views. It is wrong to entertain Pakistani artistes when we are not welcomed in their country,"" he said.
Asha Bhonsle is also a part of the show titled ""Sur Kshetra"" to be aired on Color and Sahara channels.
Last week, when Bhonsle said that she does not understand politics, and that she considers guests like god, Thackeray rebuked the singer saying he wondered if the real reason she participated in the show was ""Paisa devo bhava"" (Money is god).",Raj Thackeray threatens to shut Hindi channels misquoting him

1. Glimpse a living goddess. In the middle of Kathmandu’s Durbar Square, seek out the three-story, red-brick building that serves as home to Nepal’s “living goddess,” the Kumari Devi. Believed to be the reincarnation of a Hindu deity, the young girl who lives there is worshipped by Hindus and some Nepali Buddhists. The Kumari is chosen only after a rigorous search that includes 32 physical qualifications and tests of courage. Once she reaches puberty, she gives up her position and the search begins anew. You’re not allowed to photograph her, but postcards with her image are sold just outside her home.

An Idyllic Retreat in the Land of the Thunder Dragon 2. Relax in a garden oasis just steps from backpacker chaos. Inspired by the neoclassical gardens of Europe, the Kaiser Mahal Garden was originally built in 1920 by a Nepalese field marshal, Kaiser Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana, as part of his private home. Dubbed the Garden of Dreams, it’s just minutes from the congested neighborhood of Thamel but feels a world apart with its romantic pavilions and flowing fountains. After decades of neglect, the garden reopened in 2006 after a six-year, multi-million dollar restoration effort. After a stroll through the grounds, stop for drinks or dinner in the white-columned grandeur of the Kaiser Café. gardenofdreams.org.np 3. Experience peaceful contemplation at Nepal’s largest stupa. Ringed in prayer flags, the enormous Boudhanath Stupa is a holy site for Tibetan Buddhists and the heart of the Tibetan émigré community in Kathmandu. Pilgrims prostrate themselves on wooden planks, making a clockwise procession, called a kora, around the perimeter. A steady stream of maroon-robed monks and nuns add to the solemnity. For those who want to explore their spirituality, the Kopan Monastery nearby offers visitors daily talks as well as longer, in-depth courses on meditation and other aspects of Buddhism. kopanmonastery.com 4. Delve into the Kathmandu you can’t see anymore. Step through the carved wood and gold doors of the Patan Museum and marvel at the former royal home of the Malla rulers, who dominated Nepal for centuries. The beautifully restored museum houses a collection of Buddhist and Hindu figurines, woodwork and paintings, as well as photos showing the Kathmandu Valley of yore. The museum itself is a carefully designed space, with plentiful seating and a garden in the back with a charming café. patanmuseum.gov.np 5. Wander the streets of a living museum. Just a half-hour drive from the capital, Bhaktapur is one of the three medieval city-states of Kathmandu Valley. A visit here is a retreat into history, with cobblestone streets and largely intact Newari architecture. Get lost amid the labyrinth of alleys, shrines and temple-studded public squares that make up the core of this Unesco World Heritage site. The elaborately carved woodwork on doors and windows gives a feel for a more artistic era. The entry fee into the city is $15. Follow Scene Asia on Twitter @WSJscene.

Maharani Mala Rajlaxmi Shah of the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party defeated Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna’s son, Saket Bahuguna, by a margin of 22,694 votes in the Tehri Lok Sabha by-election on Saturday.
The BJP’s triumph is perceived to be the result of the angry vote of the citizens, who decided to either stay away on polling day or register their displeasure against the “one-sided” policies of the Congress, by voting for the BJP. “The message is clear — the people have warned the politicians to give up their gimmicks and falsehood or face defeat in polls,” remarked Shivani Thapliyal and Geeta Mishra, both political science scholars in Dehradun.
The high-profile Congress canvassing seems to have taken a beating due to the Liquefied Petroleum Gas cylinders issue, which threatened the very kitchen of every household in the region.
Other issues such as FDI and the scandals hitting the headlines almost every day and the bickering in the State Congress added to the anti-Congress sentiments, even in a stronghold like Dehradun.
Congratulating Ms. Shah on her triumph, Mr. Saket Bahuguna said he would continue working for the people of Tehri.
Ms. Shah thanked the electorate for electing her, and promised to do her best within the short span of 16 months of the present Lok Sabha’s tenure.
Jubilation in the form of fireworks, rallies complete with ‘dhol nagaras’ (drums) by BJP cadres in Uttarkashi, Dehradun, Tehri, Haldwani, Pithoragarh and Almora marked the celebrations. Leader of the Opposition Ajay Bhatt described the triumph as the beginning of the end of the Congress “misrule” and ‘ghotalas’ (scandals) in the country.
The former Chief Minister, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, described the triumph as a verdict of the people against “anti-people” and “anti-kitchen” (cylinder) policies of the Congress combine.",Maharani’s win seen as protest vote outcome

https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/indias-emergency-oil-stock-storages-face-delay/,"India’s emergency oil stockpile storage is facing a year’s delay because of geological surprises encountered in construction of underground caverns that will be used to cushion the country against supply disruptions and price fluctuations.
The first of the 5.33 million tonne of storages at Vishkhapatnam,Mangalore and Padur were to be built by 2013.
“There are some issues we faced to build the underground cavern at Vishkhapatnam. While a smaller compartment with 0.3 illion tonne will be commissioned as per schedule in March 2013,the bigger 1 million tonne cavern would be commissioned only a year later,” said Rajan K Pillai,CEO of ISPRL,the
firm building the strategic storages,said at the Petrotech 2012 Oil and Gas Conference here.
Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd,a subsidiary of Oil India Development Board (OIDB),is a special purpose vehicle that is building the strategic stockpile.
The 1.33 million tonne strategic storage under construction at Visakhapatnam will cost Rs 1,038 crore and was to be completed by October this year.
The Rs 732 crore,1.5 million tonne Mangalore storage would be completed by December 2013. The third storage at Padur,with a capacity to stock 2.5 million tonne of crude oil and cost Rs 993 crore,would be ready by April 2014.

Pillai said studies have been initiated to construct space to store an additional 12.5 million tonne of strategic reserves.
Additional storage of 5 million tonne was being considered at Padur in Karnataka and 2.5 million tonne each at Chandikhol in Odisha,Rajkot in Gujarat and Bikaner in Rajasthan.
The 12.5 million tonne of stockpile to be build would take at least 4-5 years to build,he said.

Sources said the Strategic Crude Oil Reserves are meant to take care of oil security concerns of the country and could be released to meet contingencies arising out of supply disruptions and cushion abnormal increase in prices.
An inter-ministerial empowered committee chaired by Oil Secretary will decide on releasing emergency stocks,they said,adding that the panel would include secretaries to the department of expenditure Secretary,home,Planning Commission,defence,National Security Council and shipping.
Currently strategic storages are being built in underground rock caverns but in the next phase,salt cavern storage and underground concrete tank storages would also be considered.
Pillai said the 0.3 million tonne of smaller storage at Vizag would be used by state-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for stocking oil for its adjacent refinery.
China has already completed and filled 103 million barrels of storage in the first phase of its SPR plan. It is now working on a second phase of 169 million barrels of storage by 2013 and by 2016 will build a final phase of 228 million barrels of storage.",India’s emergency oil stock storages face delay

 Never before have I felt this way about an innocent act of eating a fruit, more specifically, a pineapple. Going through Kyannamukaaka sub-county in Masaka recently, my image of pineapples drastically changed. Dotting expanses of deforested land and degraded wetlands, pineapples appeared something between an epidemic and scattered grenades set for explosion!
 It all started as a field visit that was part of a conference on climate change organised by the Masaka Diocesan Development Organisation where I had been invited as facilitator. In my presentation, titled Climate Change in Uganda: Facing the Disturbing Realities, I had referred to pineapple growing in the area as marred with disastrous practices. Though I had visited some of the degraded areas before, I was largely basing on secondary accounts of massive deforestation and severe water contamination from pesticides.
 When question time came, the District Production Officer of Masaka, seemingly hacked off by my ‘uncharitable’ remarks on pineapple growing, shot up, saying I did not have to portray the practice as though it was all negative. She, for example, observed that it had magically boosted the local economy. Moving around the area, you wouldn’t miss the nice new houses and young men cruising in brand new cars, with elbows out in emphasis of achievement.
 Indeed, pineapple growing has proved a magic financial bullet; but at what cost? The field visit was to later vindicate me as we were welcomed by sights of pineapple plantations dotted with thousands of dry tree stumps standing out in ignored ruin, as if silently screaming: ‘we once lived here!’
 A comment from a Tanzanian participant particularly caught my ear. Perhaps because it wasn’t meant for Ugandan consumption, it came in Kiswahili: ‘Hawa watu watakunywa mkojo wao; wataunywa’ (these people will drink their urine; they will drink it). An image of a boy in an arid area drinking urine directly from a cow had been earlier shown by David Cleave Waiswa from Gulu University!
 Before I could allow the Tanzanian’s comment to sink, one of the Italian participants tapped my shoulder in question: “Isn’t this the home area of the vice president?” Of course the real question was: what has the vice president done about it? “We could have asked him, but he ‘failed to make it to the conference.’ Even Prof Ephraim Kamuntu who represented him could not wait for our questions. He simply conveyed his, and the vice president’s, messages and left”, I responded.
 Apparently not amused, she smiled. Miles of forest cover in Kyannamukaaka are being indiscriminately cleared to grow the ‘wonder fruit.’ One of the residents told us that pineapples are widely believed to grow best on virgin land, most of which is forested land. And, he added: “they do not need any shade around them. They prefer to be alone.” Thus when forests are being cleared, no single tree is left standing in the garden.
 Although some clear their own forests for the agri-business, most of the forested land is rented from often desperate landlords for a period of two to four years. The landlord will have no say on the way the land is used. Theirs is just to receive the rent and wait for the land to be returned to them at the end of the agreed period. Indeed when it is returned, it is bare and exhausted! Then other ‘virgin land’ (read forest) is sought by the pineapple growers.
 In Zzimwe parish, next to a wetland, we met one old man clearing a huge forest. We asked him why he was doing that. “I want to grow coffee.” But we could see the freshly germinated maize in the part he had cleared first! Not relenting, I engaged him further: “At this rate of forest destruction, aren’t you worried about the future of this place?” With his face in a frown, but a smile dancing on his lips, he looked me straight in the eye and responded: “we are also angry! Government has cut its own forests and given some to individuals to grow pineapples and pine, why should we spare ours?”
 Across the road was a wetland virtually filled with pineapples. An official from the Masaka Environment office informed us that only one part of the wetland was gazetted; the other part is private land! When we inquired why even the gazetted part was degraded, he first kept silent, as though making a choice of words. Then, in hesitation of revealing a ‘secret’, he asked us: “how much can you do with an annual budget of Shs 500,000 for the environment office?” “You could just go and have a cup of coffee with that”, an official from the Austrian Embassy later japed.
 
 Perhaps the budget allocated to the environment office says enough about the significance attached to the environment. Given the vastness of the area, Shs 500,000 means nothing for the supervision, monitoring and coordination of environment-related activities. The population is certainly expanding and people need better livelihood choices to be able to survive and cater for their families, and with this, no one would expect the environment to remain intact. But outright destruction of forests for pineapple growing is like burning one’s furniture in order to keep warm.
 All farmers we talked to confirmed that ‘pineapples cannot be grown without using pesticides.’ Whereas their side effects on human health are not established, there are clear signs that these pesticides are washed off into open water sources. Some pineapple plantations were in wetlands, others on slopes whose runoff ends up in wells and streams. There was a sign of hope that some people are planting pine forests in areas that had earlier been degraded.
 We are told that, though better than pineapples, ‘exclusively pine’ forests may not provide an equal for the biodiversity of natural forests. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the fact that it is an isolated initiative, it is a move in a promising direction.
 It was also encouraging that at the end of the three-day conference, Masaka Local Government officials committed themselves to creating awareness among local leaders and finding sustainable ways of balancing agricultural activities with environmental conservation.

Head of the Traffic Division, Senior Superintendent Radcliffe Lewis, said the driver was found at a stall last month.
He said the bus driver has also been charged for his failure to report the crash, running away from the scene and for operating a vehicle without a driver’s license.
SSP Lewis said the vehicle was not insured.
Earlier reports indicated that the pedestrians were hit, after the bus veered off the road onto a sidewalk, while trying to avoid a collision with another vehicle.
Reports also indicate that Reid should not have been in the driver’s seat, as he was not the one employed to drive the bus.

http://iwpr.net/global-voices/life-sentence-upheld-milan-lukic,"Appeals judges at the Hague tribunal this week upheld Milan Lukic’s life sentence for a string of grisly crimes committed against Bosniak civilians in the eastern Bosnian town of Visegrad in 1992.
Lukic, a Bosnian Serb former reserve policeman, was found guilty in July 2009 of personally killing at least 132 Bosniak civilians, over 100 of whom were trapped in two barricaded houses and burned alive. (See Life Term for Milan Lukic.)
He was also convicted of abusing detainees in the Uzamnica prison camp, killing 12 Bosniak men by the banks of the River Drina, and shooting and killing a Bosniak woman called Hajra Koric.
Trial judges concluded that not enough evidence was presented to substantiate the allegation that Lukic was the leader of a paramilitary group. The prosecution did not appeal against this finding.
On appeal, judges upheld the conviction of his cousin and co-defendant Sredoje Lukic for aiding and abetting murder in one of the two house burnings. The majority of appeals judges overturned his conviction for mistreating detainees at the Uzamnica camp, citing “inconsistencies” in the evidence.
The appeals judgement reduced Sredoje Lukic’s prison sentence from 30 years to 27 years.
As presiding Judge Mehmet Guney read out the appeals verdict in open court on December 4, Milan Lukic gazed into the public gallery, smirked, and read silently from a small red bible or prayer book which he had placed on the table in front of him.
By contrast, his cousin Sredoje Lukic looked stricken and close to tears as he listened quietly, his arms crossed tightly against his chest.
A small group of female victims sat in the public gallery and cheered loudly when Milan Lukic’s life sentence was upheld. According to some observers, they also cursed at him.
At the appeals hearing in September 2011, Milan Lukic’s defence contended that witnesses who claimed to have seen the accused at crime scenes misidentified him, and that trial judges accepted their evidence without applying “key legal principles” governing identification evidence. (See Lukic Alleges Mistaken Identity.)
However, Judge Guney said the trial judges had “relied on witnesses’ prior knowledge” of Lukic, and “the inconsistencies in their accounts were minor”.
Appeals judges also dismissed his claims of an alibi for some of the incidents, finding these to be “not reasonably possibly true”. The judges pointed out that his imprisonment in Serbia from April 1993 to late 1994 – cited as one of his alibis – occurred well after the events in the indictment.
Despite the contention of Milan Lukic’s defence that the two house burnings in June 1992 – at Bikavac and at Pionirska street in Visegrad – never happened, the appeals chamber confirmed that they did occur. In both instances, Milan Lukic and other armed men were found to have shut the victims inside the houses, thrown grenades inside and shot at those who tried to escape.
The appeals chamber also confirmed that Sredoje Lukic was one of the armed men present when civilians being held in the house at Pionirska street were “robbed at gunpoint and subjected to criminal acts” before the building was torched. His conviction for aiding and abetting the murders of civilians who died in the burning house was thus upheld.
Appeals judges concluded that 53 people died in the fire at Pionirska street, not 59 as was stated in the original judgement.
They confirmed that 60 people died in the Bikavac fire, the same number as the trial chamber found.
Both defendants asked for a reduction in their prison sentences if their convictions were not overturned.
In his appeal, Milan Lukic argued that when the trial chamber sentenced him to life in prison, it did not give sufficient weight to the fact that he was “involuntarily thrust into the war”, that he was only 25 when the crimes occurred, and that he was a “low ranking” and “inexperienced” reserve policeman at the time.
The prosecution countered by arguing that Milan Lukic “grew efficient in killing while maximising suffering, enjoyed himself, and was not dissuaded by the pleas of his victims”.
The appeals chamber dismissed the accused’s mitigating arguments, stating that he did not demonstrate that his age or status as a reserve policeman were factors that trial judges failed to consider.
“The appeals chamber considers that the crimes for which Milan Lukic has been convicted are extremely grave,” the appeals judgement states.
Therefore, “the reduction of the number of victims of the Pionirska street incident does not impact the sentence imposed by the trial chamber”.
Sredoje Lukic had argued on appeal that his sentence of 30 years was “disproportionate and excessive” since he had been convicted on seven counts of the indictment while his cousin received a life sentence for 19 counts. He also argued that trial judges did not take into account evidence of his “good character” and his claim to have tried to help Bosniaks during the war.
The appeals chamber dismissed all his arguments and recalled that trial judges found that Sredoje Lukic was an “aider and abettor of a series of crimes that culminated in the barbaric killing” of civilians at Pionirska Street. It reduced his sentence to 27 years after acquitting him of mistreating prisoners at the Uzamnica camp.

The families of the victims will be given financial compensation of Rs800,000, followed by a monthly stipend of Rs7,000. However, Chief Minister Nawab Aslam Raisani had promised a sum of Rs100,000 to victims’ families at a news conference last month.According to the official, the provincial government has reserved a special fund for the compensation. Special committees, formed under the divisional commissioners of each administrative division, are to determine the number of mutilated, decomposed or bullet riddled bodies recovered in the province over the last few years. The committees have been directed to complete this task within two months.There seems, however, to be discord on the exact number of bodies recovered in the province during the last four years.

http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/01/how-citizen-aigbedion-was-mobbed-murdered-in-turkey/,"PERHAPS, if Mr. Courage Aigbedion, was told when he was leaving Nigeria for Turkey in 2011, that he was embarking on a suicide flight, he would have dismissed it with a wave of hand.
For someone, who lived in a country where relocating to Europe, seems to be the surest exit from harsh economic conditions, there would not have been anything anyone could have done to dissuade Courage from searching for greener pastures abroad. Hence, all that mattered to him while leaving Nigeria, were the prospects of landing a good job in Turkey and coming back to the country an economically satisfied person.
But all the dreams that accompanied the former staff of the Central Bank of Nigeria,CBN, were short-lived in October 2012.
Accordingly, Courage’s journey to the land of no return, started on October 17, 2012 on the streets of Istanbul, as he was allegedly mobbed by five Turkish youths and subsequently died in Police custody.
Today, the family of the deceased are distressed over this mysterious death of their bread winner.
Narrating the circumstances that led to the demise of Courage, his younger brother, Mr. Presley Aigbedion told VanguardFeatures,VF that the Edo State born ex-CBN staff, died in a police cell, where he was kept for three weeks after being mobbed to a state of coma.
‘’My brother left Nigeria for Turkey in 2011, but I don’t know the precise date he left. He was a peace loving and responsible citizen of this country. I was in the United Kingdom ,UK, when the incident happened. Upon receiving the news of his death, we had to send my elder brother, who is based in Germany to visit Turkey in respect of the matter,’’ he stated.
He further said: ‘’My elder brother made some useful findings in Turkey, which gave us the idea that our brother was mobbed to a state of coma by five Turkish youths on his way from work, he was subsequently arrested by Turkish police and was kept in their custody without medical attention. And he died three weeks after in Police custody. While in Istanbul, my brother spoke to our late brother’s flatmate, who also told us that he was mobbed and allowed to die by the Police.’’
Allowed to die in Police custody
Continuing his narration,he said: ‘’The Police and hospital reports said Courage died on October 17, 2012, since we did not know the exact date this happened, because we did not have access to the police report that must have been issued. Some visited him in jail and confirmed that he was kept in a police cell for three weeks.
His co-worker confirmed that he worked with Courage on the day the incident happened. That after work, they went separately to their various homes. His roommate also confirmed that Courage was brought into their flat at 2:00 am by the Police.
The Police asked him to bring his passport and the roommate observed that he was bleeding profusely while his left eye was heavily bandaged, Courage struggled to tell them that he was waylaid by five Turkish boys, who beat him up at about 8:00 in the night.’’
Explaining further , he said: ‘’The roommate pleaded with the police to take him to the hospital because he was in a bad state. But they said they were taking him to their station. The roommate tried to visit Courage but he was not allowed to see him. He left him an envelope with some money at the counter. Three weeks later an official of the Nigerian Community in Istanbul called the roommate to say that Courage was dead.’’
According to Mr. Aigbedion, ‘’While in Turkey, the Nigerian Embassy sent an official, Mr. Nwokolo to accompany my brother to the police station in Istanbul and the mortuary where he was kept for identification. At the police station, nobody showed us the charge sheet against him.
No body showed any repatriation form they have filed to return him to Nigeria. No one could tell us exactly what he did wrong. One of the policeman confided in me that Courage was actually beaten up and wounded when he was brought to the station.’’
Aigbedion also added thus: ‘’We went back to the hospital on December 12, 2012 to identify his remains. I saw him and his left eye was deep blue resulting from the injury he may have received. I and Mr. Nwokolo the embassy official signed some papers for the release of his body once the Turkish government agrees to bear the cost of repatriation.’’
Aigbedion, who was overwhelmed by emotion, said the Speaker of the House of Representatives had been petitioned on the matter.
Petition to House of Reps
The petition which was signed by the father of the deceased, Mr. Osazuwa Aigbedion, the family called on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to carry out a thorough investigation on the matter.
It also urged the Speaker to prevail on the Turkish Government to take responsibility for repatriation to Nigeria, the corpse of the deceased, who was allegedly murdered on October 27, 2012.
The petition written through Mr. Jim Adun, who is representing Egor/Ikpoba-Okha Federal Constituency in the House, reads:”This is to formally protest the gruesome murder of my son on the street of Istanbul, Turkey by five Turkish youths who mobbed him into a state of coma.
The said youths thereafter with the active connivance of the Turkish Police, clamped the deceased into cell for three weeks without granting him access to medical attention. He died in Police cell as a result of injuries sustained and brutality of the five Turkish youths.
‘’While I note that nothing can be done at this stage to bring back the life of the deceased, the uncivilised, brutish and degrading of human life aided by Turkish Police authority brings to the fore the culpability of the Turkish government in the death of my son.’’
It further said: ‘’In achieving justice, I want the Federal Government through the instrumentality of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Nigerian Embassy in Turkey to assist in finding answers to various questions on the matter in order to get justice for the deceased.’’

Report by Mailonline
Researchers are now working on high-tech glasses that can help people hear better, sleep better and even feel happier.
“It’s only recently that researchers have started to realise that there may be more to wearing glasses that simply having better eyesight,” says Frank Eperjesi, head of optometry at Aston University, in Birmingham.
Recent research suggests that altering the type of light that enters the eye can have knock-on effects in the body.
Eperjesi adds: “A better understanding of our visual system and how it relates to other parts of the body — in particular the brain — coupled with the development of lightweight materials has led to a range of smart specs that can be used to help detect and treat a range of health problems.
“As more developments take place over the next few years, and prices drop, we can expect to see more people wearing glasses for reasons other than better vision.”
Here we reveal the healthy specs that may soon be adorning your face.
Normal varifocals have two strengths of lenses in them, for close and distance vision, so the wearer has to look through the top or bottom to adjust their vision.
Now scientists have developed new battery-powered glasses that automatically know when you want to read or look into the distance, and adjust the strength of lenses accordingly.
The high-tech specs, with microchips and a battery embedded in the frames, contain liquid crystals in the lenses.
These are found in electronic displays, such as those on mobiles and microwaves, and change their shape when an electric current is applied to them.
When a person looks up from reading, the glasses detect this movement and the battery emits an electric current.
This makes the liquid crystals change their structure, effectively making the lens thicker or thinner.
The glasses, called the emPowers, cost around US$1 300.
“The current cost is prohibitive since a pair of varifocal lenses can be purchased for about US$130 from most opticians practices,” says Eperjesi.
“However, if the cost comes down there may be a large market for these glasses.”",Latest high-tech specs can treat dizziness and deafness

“What you see is so bizarre and inherently satirical, that it is funny. It’s a very real film, but the reality makes you laugh. The film is a serious subject — but when you see how a courtroom is conducted, you wonder how any justice can emanate from that,” says Boman.
The film has been directed by Subhash Kapoor. “The film will change people’s perspectives about what happens inside a court. Subhash has done first-hand research for the film, making it a general observation of the judiciary,” he adds. In the movie, Boman is shown as one of the top lawyers of the country, while Arshad Warsi is the underdog who dares to stand up to this powerful man. “My character has grey shades. He is unscrupulous, powerful and brilliant. Arshad’s character locks horns with mine, making it a David vs Goliath kind of a confrontation,” explains Boman.
This is the fourth film Boman has done with Arshad, after the two ‘Munnabhai’ films and ‘Hum Tum Aur Ghost’. But the two have known each other for a long time, even before Boman stepped into films.
“We go back pretty long. He was the choreographer of my debut play, Roshni. We share the same sense of humour. At that point, he had asked me to take up films, but I was not interested. Incidentally, 10 years later, he was a part of my debut film ‘Munnabhai MBBS,” he says.
Boman began his acting career on stage, and says he would return to theatre one day for sure.
“Every actor worth his salt does go back to the stage at some point. I have had a very young career in films, it’s not even been ten years. I am enjoying this chapter of my life. There will be a time when I will go back to the stage,” he says.
Other than Peekay and Happy New Year’, Boman has also signed a Telugu film, his first down South. “I liked what they offered me. It is a nice space to explore and a refreshing change. They approached me quite a few times and I said ‘Why not?’. Cinema is cinema, whatever language it may be in,” he states.",'I am enjoying this chapter of my life'

Aquino endorses LP local bets
posted February 23, 2013 at 12:11 am by Joyce Pangco Panares February 23, 2013 at 12:11 am
ILOILO City- Even before the March 29 start of the campaign period for local elections, President Benigno Aquino III has already started endorsing local candidates of the Liberal Party and bashing their political opponents. In his speeches in campaign sorties in the town of Pavia on Thursday, Aquino attacked Iloilo second district Rep. Augusto Syjuco for mismanaging the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority during the term of former President Gloria Arroyo. Syjuco, a re-electionist, was being challenged by Pavia Mayor Arcadio Gorriceta who is running under the LP banner. ""We can go back and re-elect one who is a veteran of TESDA, or we can move forward and vote for someone who will help us tread the straight path - no other than Mayor Gorriceta who will be our congressman,""Ě the President said. ""When we talk about these characteristics, I cannot help but immediately remember the old ways in TESDA which really makes my blood boil. They distributed scholarship vouchers that were not covered by enough funding, and this resulted in P2.4 billion debt for over a thousand public schools,"" the President added. This was the third time that the President turned up the heat on local politics as he fired broadsides against suspended Gov. Gwendolyn Garcia in Cebu on Tuesday. Aquino had called on the Cebuanos to support LP candidates in the province led by Hilario Davide III for governor and acting governor Agnes Magpale. Again without mentioning Garcia's name, Mr. Aquino said Davide and Magpale are not like the governor who barricaded herself in the capitol to evade a six month suspension order for abuse of authority. Garcia's brother, John Pablo Garcia, is running under UNA to clash against Davide for the gubernatorial post. Last week, Aquino also took a swipe at Laguna Governor Jorge Ejercito who is also running under the UNA banner. During a campaign rally in San Pablo City, Aquino, again not mentioning Ejercito's name, said Laguna's high official was tardy and made him wait for two hours and a half for a meeting in Malacanang. ""This official, upon arriving, even asked what was in the agenda... Every time we see each other, it's either I am about to board a chopper or was already on board. If you don't want to talk to me, there are many others who want to talk with me,"" the President said. Ejercito has been criticized in the past for reportedly arriving late at government functions. Meanwhile, administration were urged to campaign against a new proposal for water rate hikes by two private water supply concessionaires operating in vote-rich Metro Manila and neighboring localities. Bagong Henerasyon partylist Rep. Bernadette Herrera-Dy urged the government to take decisive actions to reject the new proposal for water rates hike filed¬† by¬† Maynilad Water Services Inc. and Manila Water Corp. With Maricel V.

I wonder if this is a good time to take profits now as many stocks are already expensive, but I also worry that I might regret it later if the market resumes its uptrend and goes up further. I want to maximize my profits from stocks. Can you advise me? – Evan De Vera by e-mail
A: The reason you hesitate to sell your stocks now is you have the feeling of greed that comes with the anticipation that the market will further go up. The feeling of greed tells you to hold on to your stocks and wait for it to go higher as everyone expects the stock market to break the 7,000 target soon. There is a feeling of denial within you every time you see the market falling because you don’t want to hurt your ego by accepting the possibility that you may be wrong about your expectations.

Yes, there is no doubt that the market will go up again and possibly set another record high but every time the market goes up, the risk of losing also gets bigger. Considering the rocket speed and steep rise of the PSE index, which rose by 18 percent in less than three months, it is not hard to see that the stock market may soon be due for massive correction.
It may not necessarily be a sharp fall unless there is a reason for the market to panic but it may decline slowly on choppy fashion. Speculators will trade less as buying slows down. Traders take a back seat and assess where the market stands fundamentally. Some may fear that the market has topped already. Others think that since the Philippine stock market is already trading at scary valuations, many stocks are now ripe for the harvest.
This may be the best time for you to cash in on your gains while the opportunity to sell at a good price is still there. You may have missed out selling it at the highest price but at least you will be able to sell it at a nice profit before it is too late. You will never know where the market will go next. It may recover soon or stay sluggish for some time. When you sell it now, you can have that peace of mind that you can always buy it back later when it falls further.
If you are holding on to shares that are still trading at paper loss, you can sell it at best price possible. It doesn’t have to go above your cost. If you think that the stock has nothing good to offer and it is not going anywhere amidst the bullish market environment, then make a decision to cut your losses and minimize the damage.
As a rule of thumb, cut your losses when your investment has already lost 7 to 8 percent from your purchase price. If you cut your losses at 15 percent, you will need the stock to recover by 18% to break even. If you sell your stock at 50 percent loss, you will need the stock to recover by 100 percent just to break even.
There are growing risks that indicate that the market may be on its way to correct soon. Because of so much money that is flowing into the market brought about by lower interest rates, investing in Philippine stocks has been more of liquidity driven rather than fundamentals driven. The excess liquidity in the system has been propelling the market to euphoric levels. Market players have turned into speculators from investors. When people start to ignore high P/E valuations and buy up stocks like crazy, trouble is not far behind. Sooner or later, this market bubble is going to burst and many people will be rushing to get out of the market.
As we approach the end of the first quarter, it will be interesting to see how the quarterly earnings results will turn out next month. A quick sampling of the top index stocks with at least 20x P/E and above shows that the average expected earnings growth rate this year is 23 percent. Will the first quarter earnings results align with market expectations? That is something to watch out for. If the results turn out to be disappointing, then expect the market to fall. Share prices will be falling until market adjusts to a lower P/E target.
Another risk to look out for is inflation. Declining inflation from 4.6 percent in 2011 to 3.1 percent last year helped push stock prices up. The low inflation environment is a key factor that makes the market willing to pay a premium for market P/E because there is a perception of quality in earnings growth. The growth that is not artificially caused by inflation, because it is low but by real demand.
In February, the inflation rate has started to pick up and rose to 3.4 percent, the fastest in four months. Although this is still low by any comparison, there is a probability that this trend will carry on. With so much money circulating in the system, increased consumer spending that will support our growing economy this year will likely drive inflation higher. Also, we have the forthcoming national elections when a lot of money will change hands. When inflation increases, the premium on market P/E declines.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/385775/visayan-katipunero-led-1898-cebuano-revolt-vs-spain,"CEBU—He may not be considered in the league of the country’s renowned national heroes such as Jose Rizal and Andres Bonifacio. But there is one Visayan hero who fought for the nation’s independence from Spain with the same vigor and passion.
Pantaleon Villegas, known as Leon Kilat, led a group of Cebuano Katipuneros in attacking the Spaniards on April 3, 1898, in what is now known as the Battle of Tres de Abril.
ADVERTISEMENT
Leon and the Katipuneros succeeded in forcing the Spaniards to seek refuge at Fort San Pedro and took control of Cebu for a few days.
Unfortunately, Leon was killed five days later, not by a Spaniard, but by an aide who was scared of Spanish reprisal.
But Leon’s story is not often told. In the anniversary of the attack and his subsequent death on April 3 and April 8, it is timely to recall the heroism of Leon Kilat.
While the revolution started in Manila in August 1896 and had spread like wildfire among several Luzon provinces, it didn’t reach Cebu until mid-1897.
With the help of a Tagalog Katipunero who was dispatched to Cebu, a local chapter was formed in Cebu City in June 1897, participated in mostly by the workers of San Nicolas town.
While waiting for the designated official to start the revolution, the local Katipunan chapter silently recruited members.
Leon Kilat, 24, was the designated leader of the local chapter.
Although a non-Cebuano, Leon was familiar with Cebu and had several friends here since, prior to working in Mania, he found a job in the city for a few years.
Born in Bacong, Negros Oriental, in 1873, Leon found work in Cebu City first as an employee of MacLeod and Company and then as an employee of Botica Antigua owned by a German national Andres Krapfenbauer.
ADVERTISEMENT
Before leaving for Manila, Leon worked in the stable for horses of Federico Laing.
Leon was recruited by the Katipunan in Manila where he was believed to have earned his “kalake” or supernatural powers. Besides wearing talismans, he was known to be a “kublan,” which rendered him immune to bullets and other weapons.
In the late 1897, the Spanish governor of Cebu, Gen. Adolfo Montero, took up several measures to prevent the infiltration of the Katipunan in the province after he heard that some Katipuneros had arrived here.
To counter the perceived menace, the Spaniards organized local loyal volunteers in different towns to nip the secret organization in the bud.
Threatened, the local Katipunan chapter decided it was time to wage war with the Spaniards.
With enough number of members and sympathizers especially among the prominent local leaders of San Nicolas, the Katipuneros clandestinely met to plan.
In February or March of 1898, the much-awaited leader—Leon Kilat—had arrived. After making several consultations with the local leadership, Leon Kilat agreed on a date to hold the revolt—April 8.
This date was auspicious, so they thought, since the Spanish troops would not be bringing their arms with them while filing for the Good Friday procession on that day.
It was to be the only day of the year that the Spanish troops would not be on their guard and therefore would be just like sitting ducks.
But things didn’t go as planned.
While in the thick of preparations, the Spanish authorities became suspicious, and the plot was discovered. Several arrests were made thereafter.
But the die was cast.
After the execution of a few ringleaders and the arrest of several men, the members of the Cebu Katipunan would have to stage the revolt immediately before it fizzled out.
On April 3, 1898, Cebu City was gripped with tension.
While the Spaniards and their respective families had evacuated to Fort San Pedro, most city residents fearfully stayed within the confines of their homes.
According to a reconstruction of the events published in the prewar newspaper “Ang Freeman” in 1929, “Leon, brandishing a sword, led his brothers.”
They didn’t have to wait for Good Friday anymore. The Spaniards immediately dispatched soldiers to San Nicolas at 3 p.m. “The troops, … led by Capitan Mampor,” loaded their rifles ready for combat.
Recognizing the rebels, the leader of Spanish troops ordered the attack. “The revolt was lit; the moment has come. Don Leon shouted ‘Brothers, forward!’ He unsheathed his sword and prepared his spears. The Spaniards, who, for the longest time, was used to seeing the Cebuanos stoop down and even feared to stare at his master, didn’t expect that he would rebel with puny arms and any experience in fighting.”
A never-before-seen bloodshed occurred.
While many Spanish soldiers were killed, the Cebuano forces also had casualties. But overall, the Cebuano forces had the edge before Spanish reinforcements arrived from Manila.
The revolt spread to other Cebu towns but before the Katipuneros were routed, they also showed the Spaniards that although they were ill-prepared, they too were capable of inflicting damage on them.
Meanwhile, those who sought refuge at Fort San Pedro may have felt safe inside the bastion but the Tres de Abril revolt was a lesson for the abusive colonial masters.
In fact, while waiting for reinforcements to arrive, those inside the fort suffered thirst and starvation.
Everyone, whether official or ordinary Spanish citizen, pro-Spanish Cebuanos or even prayerful friars, suffered not only discomfort but also fear because each one had been placed on rotation to act as a sentinel on guard lest the stone fort was overrun by their enemies.
It was unfortunate, however, that a few days after April 3, Leon Kilat was assassinated by Cebuanos who feared Spanish reprisals while he was seeking refuge in Carcar town.
To carry out their grim plan, the leaders of Carcar had Leon drink to the point of losing his senses before they removed his talismans so that they would succeed in liquidating him.
Worse, the assassination of the leader of the revolution was carried out by his treacherous aide, Apolinario Alcuitas.
While Leon was dying, his body was dragged to the town plaza where the townsfolk cheered: “Viva España!”
Leon Kilat had become a martyr for the cause of his people. It was April 8, 1898.
But then, despite his early demise at 24, Leon Kilat, “the man who was as fierce as a lion and as quick as a lightning bolt” had become a legend in the anti-Spanish revolution in Cebu.

https://mwnation.com/why-i-cherish-that-friend/,"It was last year in the rainy month of November. My mother was arriving from Rumphi on a night bus. She would be at Lilongwe Bus Depot by 2 o’clock in the morning.My wife and I were in Blantyre and so we just told her to get a taxi home. She was stiff scared with the idea of taking a taxi by herself and so she out-rightly declined the suggestion. But I could not imagine my mum sleeping in the bus depot until daybreak. So, I called a friend who knew a few taxis to help me arranging for one. Surprisingly, the friend was more than willing to pick her up himself despite being night and raining cats and dogs. When we arrived home the following day, we found my mum in a new sweater. Apparently, she had forgotten hers and another friend who spotted her in Mzuzu looking cold just went into a shop and bought her one – a very expensive one.How many of us have such friends whom we can call upon when we are stranded, bereaved, or simply want to celebrate with. Cultivating and maintaining genuine friendships is an important asset. More important than money. You see, many people place so much value on money and forget friends in the process. In fact, most people build friendships based on how much people can offer them in return. But trust me, it reaches a point in life when you just need friends, even just to talk to, no matter how much money you have.Maintaining good relationships is very important. Even in the work place, think about it for a moment. What happens if your relationship with your boss and your coworkers sours? You are stressed, can lose your job—your income goes down. What happens if you build stronger relationships with your boss and your coworkers? You are happy and hence perform better, get pay raises and promotions, and assume bigger projects—your income goes up.The same applies to your personal life. Let’s say you are about to move. If you have a lot of real friends, a few phone calls will get you all the help you need. If you don’t have these relationships, you will be shelling out cash for a moving service (a big cost) or doing it yourself (a huge time sink).From this, it is easy to see that building up a lot of real relationships with people is valuable. What do I mean by a real relationship? I’m referring to one where something of positive value is exchanged on a regular basis—useful advice, a helping hand, loaning of items, an ear to truly listen, and so on. Any relationship worth its salt has a healthy dose of positive exchanges of value with a minimum of negative exchanges (insults, backstabbing, gossip, incorrect advice, being an obstacle).I confess that for a long time, I didn’t know how to do this well at all. It wasn’t that I thought other people should give me value in exchange for nothing— I just simply didn’t understand the value of such exchanges.Give of yourself freely. If someone needs help, help. Don’t worry about payback. Don’t worry about what you might get out of it. Just help them. If you contact someone and find out they are stuck on a project, need a job, or need a helping hand in some other way, either provide that help yourself (if you can) or find someone who can provide that help and make the connection.",Why I cherish that friend

Baths, showers and saunas in the comfortable privacy of your own bathroom can also be extra rejuvenating with systems for spa treatments like hydro-thermo/steam massage, chromatherapy, aromatherapy and heat therapy allying themselves with your bathroom fittings. Hydro-thermo massage combines heat, water and air jets to relieve pain and ease stress.
Technology
Opulent bathroom fittings with the ‘eco-friendly’ tag are most sought-after today. Contemporary faucets are sleek with clean lines and simple minimalist designs, incorporating specially-designed jets and complex water-guidance technology to provide gentle stream or gushing waterfall effects. The luxury-loving can go for precious metal finish — silver-nickel, bronze, gold or antique-gold, besides sparkling Swarovski crystals embedded on handle-tops/intersecting-hand-levers. Glass-sculpted faucets are on offer too. Faucets with soft, rounded edges are for those who disapprove of sharp, geometric angles.
Choosing designer faucets
Faucets with infrared sensors heighten accuracy through a more intelligent sensing/analysis of the environment, thereby avoiding wrong starts. Modern faucets drive their sensors and control flow through the flowing water’s kinetic energy. Most also economise on water usage. A steam shower cabin bundling LED-enabled chromatherapy and aromatherapy on to the normal cleansing shower is available.
Adjustable seats help you share it with your partner. The dry sauna is accommodated in a cabin glass-panelled at the front to release warm air for soothing aches away. Infrared heat therapy rooms are ideal for sports warm-ups or therapeutic-massages.
Bathroom sinks too come in various hues, designs and shapes. Elegant copper sinks are popular. Dual-flush, ultra-low-flow modern toilets economise on water usage. One designer toilet has a lid that automatically lifts at your approach, flushes and closes when you leave. Through remote control, you can also avail of other facilities.
Accessible
Wall displays and multimedia systems, waterproof screens to net browsing facilities, email, telephone, music system, television are some answers for those seeking greater bath luxury. Other little pleasures include wine cooler, towel/clothes warming cabinet or wall-hung radiator, simulated fireplace, medicine cabinets with a night-light, Swarovski-crystal-studded towel bar, waterproof mirror, semi-precious-stone-studded lounge chair and soap-holders holding the bar above the sink to dry.
LED plays a major role in bathroom aesthetics, beautifying floor/wall tiles and translucent ceiling tiles.
Choose an ornate mirror and place decorative wall sconces on either side to supplement the ambient lights. Don’t forget the utility measure of a dull night light.",In the lap of luxury

Senior opposition lawmaker Son Chhay is pushing back against a recent proposal by a member of the ruling Cambodian People’s Party to withhold National Assembly salaries for those who have migrated to the newly formed Cambodia National Rescue Party.
In a letter sent to assembly president Heng Samrin last week, Chhay urged Samrin to talk some sense into ruling party lawmaker Cheam Yeap, who dreamed up the salary freeze on May 7, calling the idea an “abuse of the law” and “strange”.
Yeap, who also chairs the National Assembly Commission on Economy, Finance, Banking and Audit, threatened to take away the paychecks of 11 lawmakers who left the Sam Rainsy and Human Rights parties on April 7 to join the CNRP, a merger of the two opposition groups.
By jumping from one party to another, Yeap has reasoned, the lawmakers relinquish the right to their monthly income from the state of about $2,000.
Yeap did not cite a specific statute or internal rule when floating his proposal. But according to Cambodia’s election law, as long as assembly members make the switch within six months of the election – which is on July 28 – they cannot lose their seats in parliament unless they are voted out in the polls.
Koul Panha, executive director of the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia, said there are existing disciplinary actions that could affect a lawmaker’s salary and position. But in this case, he said, the MPs have done nothing out of the ordinary that would lead to any sort of punishment.
“First, you’d have to remove them from membership,” Panha said. “If they are still members of parliament, how can you take away their salaries?”
Chheang Vun, assembly spokesman and a CPP legislator, slammed Chhay’s letter.
“Why does he order the parliament president? This is called insolence; he is a member of parliament, he has to respect the parliament president,” Vun said.
Vun said salaries have been frozen in the past – contrary to Chhay’s statements – and that Yeap’s proposal may come before an internal committee.

It doesn’t end there. They have both lost their last three league matches. Tomorrow, they meet at Morris Depot in a match whose significance cannot be overemphasised.
Rarely in recent history of the local league have the ninth game of a season be as important in the battle against relegation as this clash. There is, however, little getting past the fact that at this early stage in the campaign, this match is a must-win especially for the army side Rhinos, who are propping up the log table with a meagre six points.
Theirs has been a pitiful story so far. They are one of the three clubs, alongside How Mine and Chicken Inn, who have scored in each and every league match this season. It is at the back where they have a crisis.
They have conceded a massive 17 goals in eight matches, an average rate of two goals a game.
“We are losing concentration and conceding soft goals. We are working on those weaknesses,” said Rhinos assistant coach Matsika Ndega yesterday.
As for the Police outfit Mambas, the match against Rhinos represents a huge opportunity to redirect their season which started brightly, but have spectacularly collapsed.

* Market regulator allowed guar futures trading to resume this month
MUMBAI, May 29 (Reuters) - India’s output of guar, a tiny seed with an outsize role in shale gas extraction, will rise this year as farmers boost planting acres in hopes of good rains, against a backdrop of attractive prices and resumption of futures trade, traders said.
India, the world’s top producer and exporter of the seed, fills 80 percent of world demand for guar, which thickens the slurry of water, sand and chemicals pumped into wells during the hydraulic fracturing process used to tap oil and gas from unconventional shale plays.
The United States, whose shale gas surge has transformed it from the world’s largest gas importer to a budding exporter, is the top buyer.
India’s western desert state of Rajasthan, which contributes more than 80 percent of the country’s output of guar, produced 2 million tonnes in 2012.
Planting acreage of the crop will go up by 5 to 10 percent this year, Shikharchand Dugar, a trader from Jodhpur, a key market in the state, told Reuters, although it was too early to forecast output.
“Sowing is definitely going to be higher because prices are attractive,” Dugar said. “No other crop would give this much return.”
Guar also brings in better returns than other cash crops, such as cotton, or lentils, because it is less labour-intensive, needs less fertiliser and helps improve soil fertility.
Farmers plant guar in the rainy months of June and July, during India’s monsoon season. The weather office has forecast average rains this year after the monsoon hits Kerala on the southern coast on June 3.
India’s exports of guar gum from January to April more than doubled to 268.42 billion rupees ($4.78 billion) over the same period last year, government data show.
Prospects for the export of guar gum have brightened as fracking is increasingly viewed as a technology with the potential to change the geopolitics of energy, thanks to its dramatic boost to North American domestic gas supplies.
Guar prices are now hovering around 8,750 rupees per 100 kg, well above the cost of production, said Surendra Kumar Yadav, another trader from Rajasthan.
The resumption of futures trading would also help farmers ascertain prices, said Badruddin Khan, associate vice-president of research at Indiabulls Commodities Ltd, a Mumbai-based brokerage.
On May 14, India’s market regulator lifted a ban on guar seed and guar gum futures that was more than 13 months old. Authorities suspended the trade in March 2012 after prices spiked more than 10-fold on strong overseas demand from the global shale oil and gas industry.",India to raise 2013 output of fracking ingredient guar gum -trade

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/414333/estrada-old-cabinet-discuss-new-job,"Insisting the city is in a mess, former President and Manila Mayor-elect Joseph “Erap” Estrada has assembled a powerhouse lineup of former Cabinet members to help generate revenues for the supposedly cash-strapped local government.
Estrada, who defeated incumbent Mayor Alfredo Lim in the last election, sat down with members of his old economic team over lunch at Mandarin Hotel in Makati City on Wednesday.
ADVERTISEMENT
With him were his former Finance Secretary Jose Pardo, former Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno, former Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla and former National Treasurer Leonor Briones.
“I decided to consult my old team to help me out in Manila,” he told the INQUIRER. “They are people of competence and unquestionable integrity.”
Estrada clarified that he was not about to appoint any of them to a post, saying they would just provide suggestions on how Manila could generate more revenues during his three-year term.
“So much is expected of me but it’s difficult to start a project without funds,” he said. “So I need their ideas too.”
Throughout the campaign, Estrada had insisted that Manila was in financial dire straits with a deficit of more than P3 billion, an allegation denied by Lim’s camp.
Among the incoming mayor’s plans to raise funds was to reassess pieces of real property and speed up the issuance of business permits.
“I want permits to be released within 72 hours so that investors would feel more welcome in Manila,” he said.
Estrada added that he would also roll out a comprehensive urban renewal plan for Manila, a project that would address problems in sanitation, environment and crime.
He said he was still forming his “transition team” that would coordinate with the outgoing administration. Asked if he would bring his trusted aides in San Juan to Manila, he replied: “Very few.”

Discussions at the highest level in the party have been on for the past few weeks on various possible solutions to the long-pending issue.
The Congress leadership has been in a dilemma after the UPA government announced on December 9, 2009 it would soon initiate the process for creation of a separate state of Telangana.
The broader thinking so far has been the party stands to lose in the Telangana region even if it announces a separate state, but would gain in Andhra and Rayalseema if it rejects or delays a decision.
Another view says Telangana is “emotionally disintegrated” and “only a division could save” the Congress in the next LS polls.
The first option for the Congress is to divide Andhra Pradesh into Telangana and Seemandhra. Hyderabad could go to Telangana while Seemandhra may get a new capital.
The second is to keep the state united and set up a Telangana Regional Council to address social, political and economic concerns of the region.
Alternatively, chief minister Kiran Kumar Reddy can be replaced with a leader from Telangana and a special package can be announced for the region.
Another option is to constitute a second states reorganization commission to address not only the Telangana issue but also demands coming from different parts of the country.
A proposed rally in Hyderabad on June 30 by a pro-Telangana group in the Congress has pushed it to take a quick decision.

Many of the industries feature on the list of violators for last six to seven years, despite the PCB serving notices to them. Also, despite the pollution watchdog introducing compulsory continuous online monitoring system to check air pollution particularly in the power and cement industries, the number of air polluting units has gone considerably up in 2012-13, as compared to 2011-12.
Considering this situation, environment protection organisation Prayatna has decided to file a public interest litigation with the Bhopal bench of the National Green Tribunal, demanding that third party independent audit should be carried out on polluting industries
Monitoring reports for the year 2012-13, obtained through RTI from the MPPCB, show that 247 industries are flouting environmental norms in the state. In all, 161 industries flouted norms of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 while 86 industries flouted the norms of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.
The Water Act, 1974 and the Air Act, 1981 prescribe the safe limits for polluting elements in water and air respectively. Any discharge beyond these limits cause serious pollution of water and year.
When compared to last year (2011-12), the number of industries flouting water pollution norms has gone down from 201 to 161, but the number of air polluting industries has gone considerably up -- from 55 to 86. This, however, does not cover Indore region.
Secretary of Prayatna Ajay Dubey, who obtained the documents through RTI, said MPPCB's monitoring reports for the last six years would be placed before the Green Tribunal to show how the polluting industries have continued to thrive in state despite them being labelled as violators for so many years. ""We have a feeling that since the board itself gives permission to these industries to function, they might not be totally unbiased as far as monitoring is concerned. Thus we insist upon independent environment audit of the industries,"" he said.
Continuing pollution of air and water could have very serious implications, not only on human health, but also on flora and fauna. It becomes especially worrying when the sources of pollution (the violating industries) are on banks of major rivers like Narmada that provide drinking water to a large chunk of the state's population.",No stopping them: Industries in MP pollute unchecked

Speaking to reporters here on Thursday, T.S. Jawahar, Senior Deputy Director General, ICMR, New Delhi, said that the public health machinery in Tamil Nadu must start eradicating mosquito breeding sources to prevent a dengue outbreak. “Pre-monsoon period is a critical time as mosquito breeding peaks October,” he said.Mr.Jawahar was in the city to participate in a two-day conference on dengue organised by the Centre for Research in Medical Entomology (CRME), a laboratory under the umbrella of the ICMR.Describing the dengue vector as a versatile virus with changing behaviour patterns, he advised the authorities not to allow water stagnation as that was a breeding source.Mr.Jawahar had a word of appreciation for the quick response of the Tamil Nadu government and the directorate of public health when cases were reported from various places in the State last year.K. Kolandaiswamy, Director of Public Health, B.K. Tyagi, Director, CRME, and others spoke on the dengue scenario and control measures.Scientists, entomologists and public health experts from various States presented papers during the technical sessions on dengue vector dynamics, integrated vector management, community empowerment in dengue control and dengue epidemiology, among other topics at the conference.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-CJB-18564,"The highly anticipated trial of once rising Communist Party star Bo Xilai began Thursday with a surprise: an almost unprecedented flood of real-time information about the proceedings.
The Intermediate People's Court in the eastern city of Jinan used Weibo, a popular Twitter-like microblog service, to deliver a running account of the trial's start. While the account started off blandly with procedural details about the number of observers and relatives of Mr. Bo (110) in the courtroom, it soon startled, posting portions of the indictment.
Among the surprises, the indictment named Mr. Bo's son, Guagua, — who is currently enrolled in law school at Columbia University — for allegedly having received property from businessmen close to his father. The indictment also accused Mr. Bo of abusing his power as party secretary of Chongqing last year after he first learned that his wife, Gu Kailai, was suspected of murder.
The posts were the first time details of the charges against Mr. Bo had been publicly detailed, and their release marks a departure from the past. Trials of senior Chinese officials over the past decade and a half have taken place behind closed doors, with details of their misdeeds being released only after sentencing.
China watchers have to reach back to 1980 for something close. Then, state television carried lengthy excerpts of the trial of Jiang Qing, the wife of deceased revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, and her radical colleagues known as the Gang of Four. That openness was part of an attempt by a reform-minded Chinese leadership to bury political opponents and their policies. Madame Mao did not disappoint, shouting at the court and witnesses in defiance.
The motive this time may be much the same. Bo remains popular among some Chinese, and the current leaders who vanquished him likely want to be seen as doing so fairly. Still, openness has its limits. Though the Jinan court said members of the media were among the observers, foreign reporters were kept out.",Level of Detail Released on Bo's Trial Nearly Unprecedented

The repaired pipelines at Kajauli waterworks in Punjab - the primary source of water to Chandigarh and SAS Nagar - broke again, and it was back to square one. Now, officials say repairs would take another three days.
The pipelines were damaged on August 20 that had led to low-pressure supply to Chandigarh and almost no supply to large parts of SAS Nagar. A senior Chandigarh MC official said, ""The Kajauli phase-4 pipeline was damaged due to negligence of the public health department of Punjab. They failed to check a damaged concrete block, which dislocated the repaired bend in the pipeline.""
The original damage to pipelines of phases 3 and 4 of the project occurred when workers were carrying out digging work for laying pipelines for two more phases.
RP Gupta, executive officer of the Punjab public health department, acknowledged, ""The pipeline could not sustain the pressure after repairs on Sunday, and was damaged again. Repair will take another three days.""
From Kajauli, Chandigarh gets 67 MGD water out of its total supply of 87 against a demand of 116 MGD. SAS Nagar gets 10 MGD from Kajauli as part of its total supply of 15.2 MGD; there is a shortfall of 10MGD anyway.
Those living above the ground floor and in the southern sectors of Chandigarh remain the worst-hit as low-pressure ensures the overhead tanks are not filled. In SAS Nagar, the problem was spread across Phases 9, 10 and 11 and Sectors 70 and 71, besides industrial areas-1 to 5 and Shahimajra village; for a week now, residents are making do with carrying water from the ground floors when the supply is on, or through private tankers.
Amrik Singh, a resident of Phase 11 said, ""It is strange that the authorities do not have any alternatives. In fact, the officials are not taking our calls, and from the past three days we are getting water from private tankers.""
Councillor Malkiat Singh said those on the first and second floors at Buterla village in Sector 41 are the worst-affected: ""Harried residents allege nothing has been done. I feel helpless.""

Fleecing tankers in SAS Nagar
The acute water shortage has left residents of SAS Nagar with no other option but to buy water from private suppliers, who are charging Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,500 per tanker, which otherwise costs Rs 350. Gopal Krishan of Phase 11 said ""I have so far bought two water tankers and paid Rs 2,000. SAS Nagar does not even have its own tankers."" The DC claimed he had told civic authorities to arrange tankers.

The man was no less than an enigma, for we could never make out what was his value system, that made him happy and sad on different occasions. When for three years he did not visit his village, but happily informed us that he had been blessed with a son, we genuinely had an expression of 'whodunit' on our faces! But Jaggar Dev wasn't bothered about it. Hold on for this till the end please.
Jaggar Dev came here in search of employment. He was as if a typical character just out of the cast of Ganga Jamuna - a Dilip Kumar movie of the sixties. He had bushy eyebrows with a mild and sparse drooping moustache. With a broad denture showing his teeth darkened with paan stains, he smiled ear to ear. He wore a vest and a dhoti. Also silver ear-ringlets.
In our mofussil town we stayed on the outskirts, quite vulnerable to burglaries. We offered Jaggar Dev the job of a chowkidar, which he thought was a regular appointment, as against his daily toiling, complicated and compounded immensely by search for a daily hiring of his labour. I gave him my NCC uniform and a whistle besides a torch. I recall him being on cloud nine, crooning, '""Sala main to sahab ban gya"" a laDilip Kumar of Sagina Mahato.
It went well for about a week but one day we found that Jaggar Dev did not wake up till late in the evening. He must have kept vigil all through the previous night. But worried, we woke him up finally. He did no talking. His eyes were swollen. He had tied a tight band around his forehead. On much insistence, he opened up and broke down, ""They beat me up! And abused me in the name of my…!"" he sobbed. ""But who? Why,"" we asked. ""The cops! They said why did I wear their vardee. And who gave me a whistle that sounded fen-fen like theirs. And they hit me here, here, here,"" he spanked his posterior thrice. We couldn't help laughing. An upset Jaggar Dev gave up the chowkidar's job.
Jaggar Dev got news that his wife was coming along with his son named Hari Ram, who was born 'unto' him in his absence. When we sought to know how, he grinned and chuckled that he had sent his dhoti to his wife through one of his cousins, who was to visit his village the previous year. Sensing our being more curious, he smiled away as if saying, ""After all, all beliefs in the world subscribe to reproduction in their own typical way.""
Well, Jaggar Dev went to the railway station to receive his folks. He carried his son proudly and affectionately in his arms, but he kept cursing his wife, who followed him quietly along with the 'dhoti-carrier cousin'. We thought he might be angry for she bore him a son not from his groins. He explained later, ""Ooo baat naahin na hai baboo! Ey sasuri to us sasur ka nati ko paan khilati layi hai! (That's not the case sir, this wretched woman has travelled with that good-for-nothing-fellow offering him the niceties of a paan)"".
I still remember his laying stress on the word paan. For having been wronged, he quit his job. For not having been wronged, he adopted his son.

BILL WATCH 47/2013
[20th September 2013]
President Opens Eighth Parliament
Parliament Adjourns to Tuesday 24th September
President Mugabe opened the first session of the Eighth Parliament of Zimbabwe on Tuesday 17th September. amid the pomp and ceremony traditionally associated with the event. As expected, MDC-T members of Parliament did not attend the ceremony. The two MDC Senators, however, did attend.
After the ceremony both Houses reassembled briefly before adjourning for one week. Business next Tuesday is expected to be confined to starting the traditional debates on the speech delivered by the President at the opening.
The President’s Legislative Agenda for the Session
[These Bills are not yet gazetted]
Early in his speech President Mugabe said that Parliament would have the task of passing Bills of three kinds:
· Bills amending existing legislation to align it with the new Constitution
· Bill for new legislation to give legal underpinning to the new structures and institutions provided for in the new Constitution
Comment: Only six of the twenty-seven Bills the President went on to mention have anything to do with aligning existing laws with the new Constitution, or underpinning new constitutional structures and institutions. And those barely scratch the surface of this complex subject. [See further comment at the end of this bulletin.]
· outstanding legislative business from the Seventh Parliament.
The Bills the President mentioned are listed below, starting with the six Bills named by him that will give effect to the new Constitution.
Six Bills to give Effect to the New Constitution
1. Zimbabwe Land Commission Bill This Bill will give legal underpinning to the establishment of the Zimbabwe Land Commission, and its taking over the tasks and role previously performed by the Agricultural Land Settlement Board. Sections 296 and 297 of the Constitution create the Commission and list its functions.
Comment: The President did not mention Bills for the other new Commissions: the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission [Constitution, section 251 to 253] and the Zimbabwe Gender Commission [Constitution, sections 245 to 247]. Nor did he refer to the need for new Acts for provincial and metropolitan councils.
2. Health Services Act
3. Medical Services Act
4. Public Health Act
Comment: The President said that “the new Constitution imposes on the State the obligation to take concrete and reasonable measures to prevent the spread of diseases and to treat health care as an inalienable right for every Zimbabwean citizen”.Several Acts would be urgently amended to reflect this perspective, including the three listed above.
5. National Prosecuting Authority Bill The President said combating corruption would be bolstered through the establishment of the National Prosecution Authority as prescribed in the new Constitution which would take over the functions previously performed by the Criminal Division of the Attorney General’s Office. Although he did not specifically mention a Bill, sections 259 and 261 of the Constitution make it clear that a Bill is essential.
6. Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission Amendment Bill A Bill is necessary to aligned existing provisions to to the new Constitution. The President also said that members of the Commission will be required to adhere to a strict code of ethics and also to publicly declare their personal assets.
Comment: It is to be hoped that Parliamentarians will find the time and the will to finalise, adopt and, most importantly, ensure the implementation of their own Code of Conduct and Ethics, which has been in the Parliamentary pipeline for over a decade. Adoption of this code will allow implementation of the declaration of assets provision in Standing Order 19, which has long been a dead letter in the absence of the Code. Also, declaration of assets requirements should be enacted for Ministers, judges and other holders of important public offices.
Other Bills Listed in the President’s Speech
[Note – subheadings are by Veritas].
Bills to mobilise funding for pro-poor economic development initiatives
The President said that the Government “will, as it prioritises the implementation of sustainable pro-poor economic development initiatives hinged on the consolidation of macro-economic stability, effect the revival of key sectors of agriculture, mining, tourism and manufacturing. This will require vigorous mobilisation of the requisite funding”. He listed the following Bills as part of this thrust:
· Banking Act Amendment Bill , to strengthen regulation of new forms of banking
And three Bills designed to “collectively enhance pension and insurance sector operations”:
· Insurance Amendment Bill
· Pension and Provident Funds Amendment Bill
· Insurance and Pensions Commission Amendment Bill
Consumer rights and fair trade

· Zimbabwe Quality Standards Regulatory Authority Bill
Mobilising resources for public infrastructure, irrigation and rural development

· Public-Private Partnership Bill
· Sovereign Wealth Fund Bill
Mining sector
· Mines and Minerals Bill
Comment: Mines and Minerals Amendment Bills have been in the pipeline for six years or more but have never been presented to Parliament for enactment. It seems that a replacement of the current Mines and Minerals Act is now contemplated.

Listed International Conventions for Approval
Like section 111B of its predecessor, section 327 of the Constitution requires most international agreements to be approved by Parliament before they become binding on Zimbabwe. President Mugabe listed the following international agreements to be brought to Parliament for its approval.
Wild life conservation
Agreements for the establishment of:
· the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Park
· the Greater Mapungubwe Conservation Park
Biodiversity, sustainable development and human well-being
Multilateral agreements aimed at “enhancing the contribution of biodiversity to sustainable development and human well-being”:
· the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits arising from their Utilisation
· the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety; and
· the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol.
Comment on Necessary Legislative Changes Not Mentioned by the President
It is disappointing that the President’s speech made only token references to what needs to be done to align existing legislation with the new Constitution. Acts that urgently require such alignment, but went unmentioned by the President, include [the list is far from exhaustive]:
· Citizenship Act
· Public Order and Security Act [POSA]
· Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act
· Criminal Law Code [full title: Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act]
· Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act [AIPPA]
· University Acts
· Police Act, Defence Act and Prisons Act
· Electoral Act
· Provincial Councils and Administration Act [which probably needs to be completely replaced to deal adequately with the elected metropolitan and provincial councils].
[Constitution Watches 33,34 and 35/2013 of 20th, 23rd and 28th August were the first of several planned bulletins on this subject, and covered some of the Acts referred to above. Constitution Watch 36/2013 will deal in detail with important changes needed to the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act to make it compliant with the Constitution.]

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/487681/woman-ahead-of-her-time-the-original-multimedia-star-chef,"Her long-running cooking show, “Cooking It Up With Nora,” predated the arrival of the slicker, more dynamic culinary shows on cable today, but the late Nora Villanueva Daza was a trendsetter nonetheless.
Her recipe books are certified bestsellers, and her two iconic restaurants —Au Bon Vivant, which served French food in Manila, and Aux Iles Philippines, which brought Filipino food to Paris—were well ahead of their time.
ADVERTISEMENT
It was her last book, however, “Festive Dishes: Nora V. Daza with Family and Friends” (Anvil, 2011), that gave readers a glimpse of her personal life and culinary career. In it, she wrote about the clans she belonged to, the Villanuevas and Guanzons, her own Daza family, and shared the treasured recipes of aunts, cousins, in-laws, nieces and children.
And then there were the chefs, past and future, names you may have just read about or whose cooking you might have had the good fortune of tasting.
In 1974, she invited two of the best French chefs then, Paul Bocuse and Gaston Le Notre, to Au Bon Vivant in Makati City; the photo of her with them is just one of her priceless mementos.
She paid tribute to two people who championed Filipino food, Dr. Felix Maramba, founder of Liberty Flour Mills; and Engracia C. Reyes, founder of Aristocrat Restaurant.
Multimedia star
Daza was a multimedia star even before the word was invented. Aside from her popular TV cooking show, “At Home With Nora” was a popular radio program, and she wrote a food column for the Manila Chronicle. Later, she also wrote a column for the Philippine Daily Inquirer.
Culinary schools may have mushroomed in the past few years, but she was at the helm of the first one, the Manila Gas Cooking School in Manila. She dedicated her last book to Victor A. Lim, who gave her a free hand to run the school and said most of the recipes taught there could be found in “Let’s Cook With Nora,” her first book.
That book was first published in 1969, but has been reprinted several times by National Book Store. It continues to sell. This was followed by “Galing Galing,” written with her daughter, Mariles, and “A Culinary Life and Festive Dishes: Nora V. Daza with Family and Friends.”
She asked me to edit the last two books—which really meant prodding her to finish, asking her for more information, wading through documents, recipes and photographs.
ADVERTISEMENT
It was, for both of us, a way of connecting godmother and goddaughter, both enthused over the same subject matter, learning from each other’s experiences.
Concrete accomplishments
It was her restaurants, however, that could be called her concrete accomplishments.
At the time when French cooking could only be had in first-class hotels, Daza opened the first Au Bon Vivant in Ermita in 1965. And when Filipino food was hardly known abroad, she put up Aux Iles Philippines in Paris in 1970, introducing our cuisine to the French, who readily took to her menu, relishing dishes such as kuhol Bicol, our version of the escargot, and gambas a la Pampanga. Its talangka sauce for the prawns was mopped up by diners with their baguette slices.
She also opened Galing Galing in Manila because, she wrote, “none of the restaurants did kare-kare well, so I thought the best way was to do it myself and turn it into a business.”
She also opened Mai Thai when diners were just starting to be aware of Thai cooking.
The restaurants are no longer around, but their recipes live on in her books. And that’s why Nora Daza will also live on in our memory, especially in the food we eat.
Daza died in her sleep in her home in Quezon City on Friday morning, Sept. 13. She is survived by her children Sandy, Nina, Bong, Mariles and Stella, and her many grandchildren.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/490261/fighting-in-zamboanga-city-diminishing-military,"MANILA, Philippines – Fresh gunbattle between government forces and Moro National Liberation Front gunmen in Zamboanga City continued for the 10th day on Wednesday, but the military claimed that fighting was diminishing.
“Yes, definitely,” military spokesman Brig. Gen. Domingo Tutaan Jr. told reporters in a press briefing when asked if the firefight has subsided, adding that, “it was not intense as of yesterday (Tuesday).”

“But again we must understand that even if there are one or two (rebels) left on this, we have to make sure that they are not able to launch any violent action or any form of atrocity,” he said.
The military said soldiers had orders to “neutralize” the remaining 30-40 rebels, who were roaming through houses in urban areas.
The spokesman said the military is still on “calibrated response” even as efforts “are not as intense” in the past few days.
MNLF leader Nur Misuari had reportedly called for safe passage for his men back to their island strongholds as part of a failed ceasefire initiative, but President Benigno Aquino III rejected the condition.
The military started their offensive last Friday, with the Air Force resorting to airstrikes for the first time since the start of the fighting in support of ground troops last Monday.
Tutaan said they were still engaging with about 70 MNLF fighters, which includes Habier Malik, a known follower of MNLF founding chairman Nur Misuari.
The spokesman said there could be less than a hundred hostages still taken by the MNLF forces used as human shields.
He also said that the rebels were possibly hiding in the villages of Sta. Barbara and Sta. Catalina. A fire broke out near Sta. Catalina early in the day.
At least 10 fire incidents have been recorded since the start of the siege., razing to the ground hundreds of homes.

On Monday, the military claimed that it has recaptured 70 percent of areas occupied by the MNLF.
“Other areas that were already in government control are now being cleared. We don’t want any collateral damage after the conflict in that area. We want to able to ensure that the area is safe for them to return,” Tutaan said.
He said it was also possible that the rebels are running low on ammunition.
“They will not sustain if it was a continuous firefight but then again we cannot engage in a continuous firefight because of the civilians,” he said.
Casualties from the running gunbattle rose anew on Wednesday. In the military’s latest update, 104 had been killed from the fighting, with 14 from the combined security forces and 83 MNLF forces. Seven fatalities were civilians.
Civilian casualties also increased to 67, from a recorded 39 wounded persons on Tuesday.
A report from the Department of Social Welfare and Development said that as of 12 noon, displaced persons went up to almost 110,000.
About 200 MNLF members believed to be backed by Misuari sailed into the southern port city of Zamboanga on September 9 to stake an independence claim and derail peace talks aimed at ending a decades-long insurgency. With a report from Agence France Presse

https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/never-knew-about-his-marriage-to-delhi-girl/,"The alleged Indian Mujahideen (IM) co-founder Mohammed Ahmed Yasin Siddibapa alias Yasin Bhatkal lived a life so secretive that his family in Bhatkal in Karnataka did not know about his marriage to a Delhi girl in 2010.
Yasin married to Zahida Irshad Khan after identifying himself as Imran Ahmed from Lucknow to allegedly create a cover for himself for carrying out terror operations across the country from the national capital. We have never met this wife of his. We only heard about her from the news. We dont know if Yasin was married at all, said his uncle Yakub Siddibapa.
The identity of Yasins wife was revealed in November 2011 after Delhi Police arrested her father Mohammed Irshad Khan and came to know that Zahida was married to a man called Imran Ahmed who worked in his arms factory. Further probe revealed that the son-in-law was none other than Yasin Bhatkal,who had not revealed his true identity to his wife.
Irshad (53),who knew about his son-in-laws antecedents,got his daughter married to Yasin because he was reportedly impressed by his knowledge of Islam and spiritual fervour. Zahida and her mother were kept in the dark about the real activities of Irshad and Yasin,and were lead to believe that they were running some kind of a manufacturing unit. Yasin remained incommunicado from his wife when he travelled around the country. The family only knew about his whereabouts when he returned to Delhi between 2010 and 2011.
Yasins family came to know about his marriage to Zahida after Irshad was arrested in 2011,said his uncle. According to Yasins family they never met or heard from Yasin since he disappeared in Dubai in 2007. Even in 2008,when Yasin is suspected to have lived in the Udupi region,a few kilometres from Bhatkal and alleged to have been involved in supplying explosives for Ahmedabad and Delhi blasts the same year,his family was not aware of it,said his uncle. Sources familiar with Yasins interrogation since his arrest last week said he has claimed to have met radical Islamist leaders like Abdul Nasser Madani in Kerala during the same period.

A Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) helicopter was forced to land in Tetu, Nyeri County due to bad weather.
Five officials from KWS, who were in the chopper, had to abandon their journey to Rumuruti in Laikipia County. They were going to hand over two projects they had financed to the community.
According to the pilot, Major(rtd) John Kayanda, the weather condition suddenly changed and he could not see clearly.
“I was unable to navigate well in the skies due to poor visibility and I had to make an emergency landing at the Hubuini Primary School grounds .Luckily, I spotted this school's playing ground and landed safely,” said the pilot.
KWS Information Officer Mr Paul Muya said the projects, a school and a laboratory for a health dispensary, was funded by KWS and had taken one year to complete.
Mr Muya said that they were quite cautious due to a recent chopper accident in which three tourists perished in the Aberdares Mountain, which is not far from the area.
“We decided to land and wait but six hours later, the place is becoming foggier and we had to cancel our journey,” said Mr Muya.",Bad weather forces KWS chopper to land

https://web.archive.org/web/20181225054929/http://capitalethiopia.com/2013/10/18/mine-ministry-developing-special-small-scale-law-for-gold-artisans/amp/,"The Ministry of Mines (MoM) is to develop a new ‘special small-scale law’ to provide incentives for traditional gold artisans in various parts of the country in an effort to increase exports.
Sinkinesh Ejigu, Minister of MoM, told Capital that the new law is in the developmental stages and will be submitted to Parliament after the second quarter of the current budget year.
The Minister said that the law will facilitate loans and duty-free schemes for sector actors to increase their exports from the current levels. “We have already put in place inducements such as duty-free schemes for mining companies, but small-scale developers should also receive similar motivation,” Sinkinesh said.
Currently, artisans are conducting mining operations using manual techniques and manpower. According to the plan, the new scheme will allow traditional gold artisans import machineries the Ministry says are needed to develop gold mining and will also facilitate loans to support the sector. Previously, especially before the 2004/05 fiscal year, the government viewed artisan gold miners as illegal producers. “After the conclusion of our study, we came to realize that they could be better employed in developing and increasing gold output and that we have to grant them recognition and provide support instead of considering them as illegal miners. Since 2005, we have been testing the sector and decided to legalize their operations in order to scientifically develop the sector,” she said.
The Ministry has been working with regional states to organize and register traditional gold miners under several associations that will then supply gold to National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE), which was previously being sold illegally across the border because there wasn’t any legal framework to sell the product in the country.
After it conferred recognition and legality to traditional gold miners with a supporting directive that stated that the miners could sell their gold directly to the NBE at international price levels, the revenue secured in terms of hard currency from the gold sector has dramatically increased. Currently, the majority of gold secured for export come from traditional exporters. In the current fiscal year, MoM plans to generate about USD 700 million from gold collected by artisans, about 70 percent of the USD 1 billion target it has set to earn from gold and tantalum. The biggest gold exporter, MIDROC, is expected to generate USD 231 million from exports.
The particular focus on traditional artisans is based on the performance they have shown, which has led to the development of a new special small-scales law. “Without any support, the artisans have registered good performance and we believe additional support and incentives will have a positive upward development of the sector,” Sinkinesh said.
A week ago, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stated at a press conference that traditional gold miners have unexpectedly become a major source of export revenue for the country. “Due to that fact, proper attention and support must be given to the sector,” he added.
According to the Minister, the original target set in the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) was upwardly revised due to the high performance registered, compared with the baseline on which the original target was set.
In the 2009/10 fiscal year, hard-currency earnings from traditional gold production exports were USD 214 million, which initially became the baseline for the five-year GTP plan.
But revenue secured from the sector was very high indeed compared with the target in the GTP.
According to Sinkinesh, in the 2010/11 fiscal year gold exports from traditional miners reached to over USD half a billion, which was the target set for the end of the GTP period, and the revenue in 2011/12 was over USD 600 million. In the past year, however, revenue declined slightly compared to the previous year as international market prices declined.
Revenue from the mining sector, mainly gold exports, has become one of the major hard-currency earners for the country, outperforming other sectors that were expected to generate more export revenue in the five-year plan.
Several gold mining companies who utilize scientific techniques have taken possession of concessions in different areas of the country and some of them have already announced that they have discovered huge deposits. Sinkinesh stated that gold exports will become one of the major exports of Ethiopia in the near future. She said Humera, Metekel, Welega in the West and Northern Ethiopia are areas where enormous gold deposits were discovered by these companies. “We have a lot of hope for the sector,” she concluded.",Mine Ministry developing ‘Special small-scale law’ for gold artisans

https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/serial-gaffes-put-modi-on-back-foot/story-whYTpwSMzt2tnVaTVBWOFI.html,"When Gujarat chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi confused freedom fighter Shyamji Krishna Verma with Jan Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee on Sunday, it was not the first time he tweaked the history books.
With the race to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections getting more intense, Modi's fiery speeches fraught with factual errors are hogging the limelight.
Consider this: at the October 27 rally in Patna, which was held after serial blasts rocked the Bihar capital, Modi made a series of mistakes.
""When we are reminded of the Gupta Dynasty we are reminded of Chandragupta's rajneeti,"" he said at the rally.
Bihar chief minister and Modi's political rival, Nitish Kumar, replied, saying, ""The BJP has amazing grasp of history. They should know Chandragupta was of Maurya dynasty, not of Gupta dynasty.""
It did not stop here. At the same rally, Modi went on to add, ""Alexander's army conquered the entire world, but was defeated by the Biharis. That's the might of this land.""
READ: Nitish's point-by-point rebuttal of Modi
Kumar once latched on to the opportunity, saying: ""Alexander's army never crossed Ganga and he wasn't defeated by the Biharis.""
On the same day, Modi triggered another storm in the social media. This time, he said, ""Taxlia, the learning hub of ancient times, was in Bihar.""
Pat came the reply from Kumar. Taxila, which is in Pakistan, is nowhere near Bihar, he said,
A newspaper quoted Modi saying India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru did not attend the funeral of his home minister, Sardar Patel.
Later, the newspaper published a correction saying he had been misquoted. Gujarat chief minister had expressed his thanks by tweeting.
READ: Narendra Modi's mistakes give 'foes' chance to teach him history
On Sunday, Modi landed in a tight spot once again when Prime Minister Manmohan Singhon Saturday took a dig at the BJP for twisting history.
Addressing a gathering after the inauguration of a hospital in Gujarat's Kheda district, he said, ""Syama Prasad Mookerjee was a revolutionary. He died in 1930 in London. But the Congress never bothered to bring back his ashes to the country.""
The person Modi was referring to was Shyamji Krishna Verma, a freedom fighter, lawyer and a journalist.
Mookerjee was the founder of the Jan Sangh, which later became the BJP. He died in a Jammu and Kashmir prison on June 23, 1953 - 45 days after being detained for entering the state without a permit.
At a rally in Punjab in June this year, Modi had held India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru responsible for Mookerjee's death.
But on Sunday, Modi said, ""Nehru should have sent an emissary to bring the ashes (of Mookerjee) back. The Congress government didn't get them back till 2003. It was me who brought the ashes to India in 2003.""
Modi later apologised for the blunder. But his critics on Twitter described him as ""his own party's history"".

Customers, who comprised mostly of just paid soldiers, had spent the morning queuing at the Metropolitan Bank building, trying to get money ahead of the Christmas period.
But things soon turned ugly, allegedly because there was no staff to help the crowd.
SW Radio Africa’s Bulawayo correspondent was outside the bank at the time and explained that the crowd grew more and more restless, and eventually a plate glass window at the front of the bank was smashed.
“There was no one attending to the huge crowd of customers, and they started shouting obscenities at the bank staff and getting really angry,” Saungweme explained.
After the window was broken riot police were dispatched to prevent any more disturbances.
This is the second time this week that the window at the entrance to the same bank was smashed by angry customers, who have been waiting days to withdraw their salaries.
On Monday customers, again mostly of soldiers, tried to access their money from the bank after being paid. But in the midst of a severe liquidity crisis and widespread cash shortage there was no money and they turned their anger on the bank and its staff.
“Today it seems there was some negligence on the part of the bank, because there was no staff despite the big queues. There was nobody inside the premises, so people were just left out there,” Saungweme said.
The bank has not yet responded to requests for comment.
Saungweme said that elsewhere in Bulawayo on Thursday similar incidents were unfolding, including at the FBC Building Society. A mob of customers stormed the building, breaking the electronic security door.
In recent weeks here have been reports of long queues and general discontent with banks not having the cash that its customers have desperately been trying to access.
On Monday in Harare, riot police were called in after a mob stormed the Allied Bank building in the capital and manhandled a bank manager.
The bank had to summon the riot police who dispersed the crowd by using tear gas. The attack on Allied Bank followed a similar incident at the Metropolitan Bank’s Mutare branch, which required police intervention to rescue workers. The manager there fled the office and sought refuge at the police station.

IE The party has already hinted at naming Rahul as its PM candidate although the timing is not yet final. IE
Gearing to fight a tough Lok Sabha election in just three months’ time, the Congress is working on an elaborate plan to effect changes in the AICC, which could see many of its senior general secretaries being eased out of organisational responsibilities of key states so that they can be fielded as candidates in the polls.
As a corollary, some ministers will return to the party, top sources said.
They said the rejig could take place in the days after the January 17 AICC session. Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi is also expected to formally launch his campaign after the session, they said.
The party has already hinted at naming Rahul as its PM candidate although the timing is not yet final. Significantly, his sister Priyanka on Tuesday attended a meeting of top Congress leaders called at Rahul’s house to draw up the tour schedules of Rahul and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.
Although party sources ruled out her contesting the elections or campaigning nationwide, her presence at the meeting triggered speculation about whether she was set to play a more active role in the party ahead of the elections.
Sources, however, said Priyanka joined the meeting – attended by Ahmed Patel, Ajay Maken, Janardan Dwivedi, Jairam Ramesh and Mohan Gopal – towards the end and suggested that not much should not be read into it.
“Priyanka Gandhi is a member of an important political family. May be she is not seen as participating in active politics, but she has been an active member of the Indian National Congress for long. She has been looking after election work in Amethi and Raebareli and she is still doing that. She has her own opinions on political issues and she has been discussing with party workers from time to time. It is not surprising if she has talked to senior leaders of the party on these issues. What is new in it?” Dwivedi said. Party sources said the leadership wants senior AICC general secretaries and some other office-bearers to contest elections. Many such as Digvijaya Singh and B K Hariprasad have already expressed their willingness to contest. The sources, however, added that the view of individual office-bearers about contesting would be sought.
While many key general secretaries such as Ajay Maken, C P Joshi, Gurudas Kamat and Mukul Wasnik are already members of Parliament and are expected to be renominated, it is not clear whether leaders such as Ambika Soni and Janardan Dwivedi, who are in the Rajya Sabha, will be asked to contest.
The BJP had conducted a similar experiment in 2009 when it fielded most of its leaders then in the Rajya Sabha – such as Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj and Jaswant Singh – in the Lok Sabha polls in the hope of boosting its numbers.
On the other hand, ministers such as Ghulam Nabi Azad, Jairam Ramesh, Sachin Pilot and Jyodiraditya Scindia could quit and return to the party to take up key organisational tasks.
Sources said it was unlikely that the changes would take place before the AICC session on January 17, but pointed out that the party will have to effect the reshuffle soon. Also on the cards are changes in PCC presidents in several states, among them Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh, and changes in the media faces.
Sources said some present spokespersons would be axed and four to five new faces could be inducted. The 36-member list of television panelists could also see some pruning and additions.
“The reshuffle is unlikely before the AICC session because the general secretaries in charge of the states have to coordinate with the states they are in charge regarding the participation of delegates and the speakers at the session. But the party will have to make the changes soon as there is little time left,” a senior general secretary said.
Congress sources said while party chief Sonia Gandhi has rarely gone for drastic changes in the organisation in the past, the scope and expanse of the reshuffle becomes unpredictable as vice president Rahul Gandhi is keen to do a thorough restructure.",Congress plans to tell many of its talking heads to go fight elections

He was soon overpowered by AAP activists and handed over to the police, who detained him but later released him as Mr.Vishwas did not press charges.While Jafri (19) claimed to be from the Mulayam Singh Yadav Brigade, his affiliation has not been confirmed.Reacting to the incident, Mr. Vishwas said it showed that the Opposition parties were jittery by the AAP’s success in Delhi.“If these three-four political parties think that by throwing eggs and ink at AAP press conferences, by attacking us and causing disruption they will win elections, they have not learnt any lessons from the Delhi elections. Amethi will be won by a greater margin. We will win it responsibly,” he said.In the coming general elections Mr. Vishwas is likely to fight the Amethi seat, currently held by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi.Mr. Vishwas, who is to address a Jan Vishwas rally on Sunday, said he expected such disruption in Amethi. “The more they indulge in such disruption, the greater will be the margin of our victory,” he said.

https://www.thezimbabwean.co/2014/02/land-use-planning-is-back/,"Land use planning was used as a tool of control during the colonial era and, as a result it became a focus for resistance during the liberation war. Managing land and its use is always political, despite the proclamations of a technocratic state that science should prevail. The height of land use planning was of course during the implementation of the notorious 1951 Native Land Husbandry Act. Mike Drinkwater and Jos Alexander among many others have described the consequences, and the implications for people’s livelihoods and also social and political configurations in the countryside. Terry Ranger in particular described the implications for political mobilisation before and during the liberation war.The plans associated with the Act had precedents in the technical advice of ‘Chief Instructor to the Natives’, E.D. Alvord, dating back to the late 1920s. Indeed the Southern Rhodesian state had a long history of imposition of plans, rules and regulations that influenced and limited how people could live and farm. People were put in settlement lines, contours were dug in particular ways to prevent soil erosion, gardens were banned from within 100 feet of waterways, the pulling of sledges was banned, and so on, and so on. Perhaps the most extreme imposition was destocking that was aimed at bringing livestock populations within a notional ‘carrying capacity’.All of this was justified by science. There was a science of ‘civilised agriculture’ as described in a paper I co-authored with William Wolmer back in 2000. There were impressive scientists and field practitioners involved in defining the parameters. Alvord himself was of course one, but there were many others. Illtyd Pole Evans was another. He had a major influence on grazing management policy, influencing the 1939 Commission of Enquiry into Natural Resources of the Colony, and extension policy on ‘communal grazing’ ever since (despite my and others’ attempts at a critique from the 1980s onwards!).There was a scientific rationale justified according to certain assumptions, usually derived from large-scale commercial farming. Thus ‘optimal’ stocking rates were based on beef ranching, and rotation and cropping systems based on extensive commodity production. Thus mixed livestock and cropping systems, and such practices as intercropping were banned. Indigenous systems for soil and water conservation were looked over, and engineering solutions derived from elsewhere (often South Africa or the US) were imposed. Optimal land uses were defined according to ‘suitability’ and  ‘capability’ maps based not on people’s social-cultural and economic needs but on soils, rainfall and vegetation patterns.The most famous such mapping was conducted by Vincent, Thomas and Staples in 1960 in their agroecological survey of Southern Rhodesia that defined five ‘natural regions’ in Zimbabwe. Even today we still hear cries that particular areas should not be used for cropping, and are only suitable for livestock, even if cropping has been part of livelihood systems for centuries. Again, an industrial, modernist, commercial production imaginary is imposed, in neat, scientized maps and charts that carry with them an authority that has had huge implications.Today there are calls for a new effort in land use planning. The World Bank is reportedly planning a major exercise. There are some good arguments put forward, not least by Mandi Rukuni, who knows the history well. Through the land reform the use of land has changed dramatically, and without a sense of what is where, sensible planning cannot take place. Some areas need to be protected from encroachment, such as agricultural land near urban areas, and so some form of regulated zoning is required. And with a clearer picture of how land is being used, a land administration system can be developed, allowing registration, the issuing of leases, perhaps land taxation. These are all sound reasons for investing in some efforts.But the lessons of past attempts should be borne in mind too. The temptations of over-eager technocrats in 2014, just as 60 or more years ago, need to be offset. There is too often a sense that ground level problems will be solved through ordering, control and technocratic imposition. The view from above, from satellite images or air photos, can be misleading. And the urge to draw lines with the chinograph pencil or (more likely these days) the computer cursor that runs roughshod over people’s own constructed and lived-in landscapes is high.There has been much wringing of hands among Zimbabwe’s planners, as well as many others, about the ‘chaotic’ nature of land reform. Indeed ‘chaotic’ has become the statutory epithet in both academic and media commentary. Yet, as we showed in a paper now over a decade old, there was order in the chaos, and war veterans involved in land invasions often bizarrely followed old planning rules in the early allocation of land and settlement before the formal ‘fast-track’ planning took over. The technocratic impulse is strong, even among those who fought a war that mobilised people against the impositions of Rhodesian planning laws.Indeed, as we have shown in our work in Masvingo, it was the responsive informality and often the breaking of old rules and regulations that has allowed A1 farms in particular to develop. Unconstrained by particular requirements, they have been able to adapt to circumstances without the strictures of a constraining technocracy. Similar results have been found from across the Limpopo where in South Africa the technocratic impositions on land reform have been highly disabling. Here too it was the informal settlements that prospered most, whereas those that followed the rules and land use plans were almost designed to fail from the start.While not advocating a completely anarchic approach (there are clearly some regulations around land and its use, perhaps especially around environmental management that make sense), avoiding closing down flexibility and options for change should be avoided at all costs if the current revival of land use planning is to have a benefit. There is an urgent need to develop a more locally-rooted, participatory approach to planning, where external experts become facilitators, rather than imposers of state-defined scientific diktat. This really would be a revolutionary approach to land use planning for Zimbabwe.This post was written by Ian Scoones and originally appeared on Zimbabweland",Land use planning is back in vogue in Zimbabwe

https://www.thehindu.com/features/downtown/no-play-thing/article5673301.ece,"The stands are there but the swings are missing. A motor room has been built but there are no machines to pump water. A walking path has been laid but hardly anyone sets foot on it. A place for planting trees has been created but nothing but weeds grow there. This Corporation playground at Peeram Street, Saligramam, is anything but a place for children to play or people to enjoy a peaceful walk.The almost two ground land was handed over by a private firm in accordance with government regulations to forgo 10 per cent of land for creation of a playground. The playground did come in the place but served its purpose for just six months. “The Corporation created a well-planned playground with good layouts. As we live right next to the playground, we thought we would make the most of it. A security guard was also appointed to ensure upkeep of the park,” says a resident.Six months later, the guard quit the job. “He told us that the Corporation had not paid him his salary. Once he left, the playground fell into total neglect. The motors used to water plants were stolen, later someone came and took away the swings and see-saws. Slowly, women and children stopped coming and the playground was taken over by anti-social elements,” he adds.Residents complain that people from a nearby slum use it as a drinking spot and often engage in brawls. “They use foul language and when we try to stop them they turn on us. I can’t send my children anywhere near the park,” says a woman resident.Some even jump the compound wall into the residential flats. “Some kids from the slum play cricket during the day. The compound wall is so low that the ball lands up in our apartment. They jump the wall to take it back. It is such a nuisance,” she adds.Adding to the trouble, the street lights have not been working for a long time now. “At night, people come and sleep in the playground. Sometimes they are there even while kids are playing.” The residents want the playground to be made a cleaner and safer place. “We were so happy when the playground was created. We want it to be restored to its pervious state,” they say.

http://www.reuters.com/article/olympics-china-idUSL5N0LD0AT20140208,"SOCHI, Russia, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Beijing made its case on Saturday to become the first city to host both summer and winter Olympics, outlining a bid for 2022 that sceptics say has the odds stacked against it.
The Chinese capital, which staged the summer Games as recently as 2008, faces an uphill struggle because the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is thought to be reluctant to award three Games in a row to Asian cities.
The next Winter Olympics will be in Pyeongchang in South Korea and Tokyo won the right to host the 2020 summer Games.
“We are making sure we are fully prepared ourselves and I hope the IOC will chose the most suitable city,” Yang Shu’an, vice-president of the Chinese Olympic Committee, told a news conference in Sochi when asked about the issue.
The IOC will make its decision on the venue next year.
Russia has spent $50 billion on the Games and related developments around the Black Sea resort of Sochi and the IOC is concerned about such spiralling costs for Olympic hosts.
Stockholm pulled out of the race for 2022 last month, the Swedes saying the financial sums did not add up. That left Beijing to compete with Norwegian capital Oslo, the Polish city of Krakow, Lviv in Ukraine and Kazakhstan’s Almaty.
The Beijing bid is a joint one with the city of Zhangjiakou, in Hebei province, some 220 km northwest of the Chinese capital and an area which officials say has a long history as a ski centre.
The iconic “Bird’s Nest” stadium, the centrepiece of the 2008 Games, would host the opening ceremony, while Alpine skiing and some sliding events would be held in the mountains midway between Beijing and Zhangjiakou.
Work would begin this year on a high speed railway line that would cut the journey time between the two main cities to just an hour and should be completed by 2017.
“In 2008, Beijing delivered a truly exceptional Games. We hope to fulfil the dream of a summer and winter Olympics in the same city,” said Yang Xiaochao, deputy mayor of Beijing.
He said the rail link would be completed whether or not China got the Games. The bid is designed to promote winter sports in China, the world’s most populous country and home to an expanding middle class.
“Winter sports in China are not very well developed. It would help to boost winter sports in China,” said the deputy mayor. He would not be drawn on how lavish a Games China would stage, saying only that spending would be kept within an unspecified budget.
Sports politics observers believe China could be doing the groundwork for a future bid. It got the summer Games only after suffering the disappointment of losing out to Sydney for the 2000 event.","Olympics-Defying sceptics, Beijing seeks to host 2022 Games"

Commissioner Konyi told Eye Radio that the schools will be reopened despite the lack of teachers in the area.
“Our problem is that the new curriculum has not reached us, and also the problem of teachers, because some of them fled to Juba during the fighting,” he said.
Commissioner Konyi added that their plan will be supported by UNICEF.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/will-make-life-difficult-for-congress-bjp-kejriwal/story-cvqadpmrfTGDIES4AqkXtK.html,"Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said he would make life difficult for both Congress and BJP in the coming days.
Addressing his first Lok Sabha poll rally in Delhi, only nine days before polling here, the AAP leader said, ""These parties say I ran away from governance. I didn't flee to Pakistan. I will struggle here, die here. 'In parties ki naak me dam kar dunga'.""
The AAP leader looked to boost the morale of the party, which has been facing criticism from some quarters after he chose to quit government in Delhi after 49 days and moved to fight Lok Sabha elections.
Thundering that ""CM ki naukari chhodne ke liye jigra chahiye hota hai"", Kejriwal said, ""I never ran away; Lord Rama and Raja Harish Chandra also made sacrifices, thank god there was no BJP then to attack them.""
Responding to Congress president Sonia Gandhi's jibe that governance was no child's play, Kejriwal said: ""Soniaji shouldn't have said this about Rahul Gandhi."" It evoked cheers from the supporters at Dwarka in West Delhi parliamentary constituency.
AAP candidate from West Delhi, Jarnail Singh, is pitted against Congress' MP Mahabal Mishra, and BJP candidate Pravesh Verma.
Kejriwal said AAP formed government in Delhi when an overwhelming majority in the Capital asked him to. ""We had to quit when Congress and BJP joined hands and didn't let us work,"" he said.
""No party has ever done as much work as AAP did in those 49 days,"" he said.
Attacking BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi, who called Kejriwal a Pakistani agent and AK-49, the AAP leader said, ""Nothing moves in Gujarat without payment of bribe.""
He accused both Congress and BJP of not allowing fresh elections from being held in Delhi. Kejriwal said after parliamentary elections in Delhi, he would go to Varanasi to defeat Modi and urged the crowd to go with him to the temple town.
Kejriwal said if people defeated Modi and Rahul Gandhi, both NDA and UPA would be finished. ""Kumar Vishwas has told me he would defeat Rahul Gandhi by a huge margin,"" he said.
In the December 2013 assembly elections, AAP had made a spectacular debut with 28 seats. But the latest ABP-Nielsen opinion poll in Delhi indicates that AAP may be losing ground.
After taking part in public rallies and road shows in Haryana, Kejriwal will now campaign in Delhi every day. He will campaign for Chandni Chowk nominee Ashutosh on Tuesday.","Will make life difficult for Congress, BJP: Kejriwal"

На ства­рэн­не та­ко­га су­ве­ні­ра Дзі­я­не па­тра­бу­ец­ца ка­ля ме­ся­ца. Школь­ні­ца, да­рэ­чы, толь­кі вы­шы­ван­нем руч­ні­коў не аб­мя­жоў­ва­ец­ца. Дзяў­чы­на зра­бі­ла яшчэ і вя­сель­ны на­бор у бе­ла­рус­кім сты­лі. У яго ўва­хо­дзяць руч­нік, па­ду­шач­ка для пярс­цён­каў, скрын­ка для па­до­ра­ных гро­шай, фо­та­аль­бом, кан­вер­ты для па­да­рун­каў ад гас­цей і бан­бань­ер­кі.
Ка­лі б уда­ло­ся па­ба­чыць гэ­тыя рэ­чы без іх аў­та­ркі, ад­ра­зу б і ў га­ла­ву не прый­шло, што зра­бі­ла іх су­час­ная школь­ні­ца. Але гэ­та са­праў­ды так. І вы­шы­ваць Дзі­я­ну і яе сяб­ро­вак на­ву­чы­лі не ба­бу­лі ці ма­ту­лі, а на­стаў­ні­цы.
— Ка­лі ра­ён­ны ад­дзел аду­ка­цыі звяр­нуў­ся да нас з прось­бай ства­рыць школь­ную біз­нес-кам­па­нію, мы па­ча­лі ду­маць, які на­пра­мак абраць. Яшчэ да гэ­та­га ўсе гос­ці, што на­вед­ва­лі на­шу шко­лу, не з'яз­джа­лі без не­вя­ліч­ка­га па­да­рун­ка — «кар­па­ра­тыў­най» вы­шы­тай за­клад­кі. Вуч­ні ра­бі­лі іх на ўро­ках пра­цы. Та­му вы­ра­шы­лі за­няц­ца ме­на­ві­та вы­шы­ван­нем і ства­рэн­нем су­ве­нір­най пра­дук­цыі і па­ча­лі рас­пра­цоў­ваць асар­ты­мент, — ус­па­мі­нае на­мес­ні­ца ды­рэк­та­ра па вы­ха­ваў­чай ра­бо­це, ку­ра­тар ад­мі­ніст­ра­цыі біз­нес-кам­па­ніі, на­стаў­ні­ца аб­слу­го­вай пра­цы Ва­лян­ці­на Іва­наў­на Ра­бі­ноў­ская.
 
Вёска Пет­ка­ві­чы да­стат­ко­ва ма­ла­дая, і май­стрых, якія маг­лі б на­ву­чыць ста­ра­даў­няй вы­шыў­цы, тут ня­ма. Та­му Ва­лян­ці­на Іва­наў­на ра­зам са сва­ёй ка­ле­гай, на­стаў­ні­цай ма­тэ­ма­ты­кі і кі­раў­ні­цай школь­най біз­нес-кам­па­ніі Га­лі­най Іва­наў­най Цэ­ла­гуз, спа­сці­га­лі ўсё са­мі, ка­рыс­та­ю­чы­ся са­мы­мі роз­ны­мі кры­ні­ца­мі ін­фар­ма­цыі. Яшчэ да ства­рэн­ня біз­нес-кам­па­ніі на­стаў­ні­цы вя­лі гурт­кі па ру­ка­дзел­лі. Тых, кто лі­чыць, што ма­тэ­ма­ты­ку і твор­часць су­мяс­ціць цяж­ка, Га­лі­на Іва­наў­на на сва­ім пры­кла­дзе мо­жа лёг­ка пе­ра­ка­наць у па­мыл­ко­вас­ці та­кой дум­кі.

— Я са­ма шы­ла са­бе вя­сель­ную су­кен­ку, люб­лю вя­заць, умею ткаць на ста­ра­даў­нім стан­ку і, зра­зу­ме­ла, вы­шы­ваць. У той жа час і ма­тэ­ма­ты­ка для мя­не — ад­на з са­мых лю­бі­мых спраў. Мне заўж­ды бы­ло ці­ка­ва ра­за­брац­ца са скла­да­най за­да­чай. Муж на­ват ча­сам за­бі­раў кніж­ку і сшы­так. Маў­ляў, ня­ўжо та­бе ў шко­ле на­ву­кі не ха­пае, хоць до­ма ўжо ад­пач­ні. Так што ў ма­ім вы­пад­ку ма­тэ­ма­ты­ка і ру­ка­дзел­ле да­паў­ня­юць ад­но ад­на­го, — ка­жа на­стаў­ні­ца.
 
Той, хто хоць раз спра­ба­ваў вы­шы­ваць, цу­доў­на зра­зу­мее яе сло­вы. На­ват звы­чай­ныя кры­жы­кі па­тра­бу­юць уваж­лі­ва­га лі­ку, а ка­лі пра­ца­ваць з на­бо­рам, тут уво­гу­ле без доб­ра струк­ту­ра­ва­на­га мыс­лен­ня не абы­сці­ся. Ад­ступ­лен­не ад пра­віль­на­га ўзо­ру хоць на мі­лі­метр па­гра­жае са­пса­ваць усю ра­бо­ту.
Але ка­лі ўсё зроб­ле­на ідэа­льна, атрым­лі­ва­юц­ца цу­доў­ныя рэ­чы. Лю­дзі на­ват ча­сам не ра­зу­ме­юць, што ба­чаць пе­рад са­бой вы­шыў­ку, пы­та­юц­ца, на якім стан­ку гэ­та вы­тка­лі.
Ця­пер у школь­най «май­стэр­ні» ў Пет­ка­ві­чах мож­на за­мо­віць руч­ні­кі, сур­вэт­кі, за­клад­кі-абя­рэ­гі, бі­руль­кі, кан­вер­ты для гро­шай, з які­мі звы­чай­на ідуць гос­ці на вя­сел­ле, чах­лы для ма­біль­ных тэ­ле­фо­наў, вок­лад­кі для кніг і вя­сель­ных аль­бо­маў і ін­шыя рэ­чы та­ко­га кштал­ту.
Ка­лі ж ву­ча­ні­цы па­спя­ва­юць і за­ня­ткі на­вед­ваць, і вы­шыў­кай зай­мац­ца? Час­цей за ўсё дзяў­ча­ты бя­руць пра­цу да­до­му і вы­шы­ва­юць у свой воль­ны час. У шко­ле іс­нуе фа­куль­та­тыў «Асно­вы прад­пры­маль­ніц­кай дзей­нас­ці». Але на ім не да твор­час­ці — там больш зай­ма­юц­ца біз­нес-пла­на­мі і роз­ны­мі ар­га­ні­за­цый­ны­мі мо­ман­та­мі, якія да­ты­чаць біз­нес-кам­па­ніі. Так­са­ма дзяў­ча­ты-май­стры­хі на­вед­ва­юць гур­ток, на якім рас­пра­цоў­ва­юць схе­мы вы­шыў­кі і ма­дэ­лі пра­дук­цыі.
З усім аб'­ёмам пра­цы спраў­ля­юц­ца 12 ча­ла­век, за­дзей­ні­ча­ных у біз­нес-кам­па­ніі, але вы­шы­ваць ву­чац­ца мно­гія. Спра­ва ў тым, што «біз­не­соў­цам» мож­на стаць толь­кі ка­лі та­бе споў­ні­ла­ся 14 га­доў. Ма­лод­шыя ж мо­гуць на­вед­ваць гур­ток і ву­чыц­ца вы­шы­ваць, каб у бу­ду­чы­ні да­лу­чыц­ца да вы­твор­час­ці су­ве­ні­раў.
— Дзе­ці вель­мі за­ці­каў­ле­ныя ў гэ­тым, — ка­жа Га­лі­на Іва­наў­на. — Яны не прос­та на­вед­ва­юць гур­ток па ін­та­рэ­сах, а ма­юць маг­чы­масць за­ра­біць свае пер­шыя гро­шы, ня­хай і не над­та вя­лі­кія. Вель­мі доб­ра, што ўжо ў пад­лет­ка­вым уз­рос­це на­шы ву­ча­ні­цы ра­зу­ме­юць зна­чэн­не за­роб­ку. Так, на­шы дзяў­ча­ты без праб­лем мо­гуць пад­лі­чыць аб'­ём зроб­ле­най за ме­сяц пра­цы, ад­няць па­да­ход­ны па­да­так і та­кім чы­нам да­ве­дац­ца су­му сва­ёй зар­пла­ты.
Тут усё сур'­ёз­на. Юныя май­стры­хі ве­да­юць, што ў біз­нес-кам­па­ніі ёсць свой ка­са­вы апа­рат і афі­цый­ная рэ­гіст­ра­цыя ў пад­атко­вай ін­спек­цыі.
Ня­гле­дзя­чы на до­сыць праг­ма­тыч­ны па­ды­ход да спра­вы, кош­ты ў пет­ка­віц­кай «су­ве­нір­кі» дэ­ма­кра­тыч­ныя: за­клад­кі-абя­рэ­гі каш­ту­юць 15 ты­сяч руб­лёў, кан­вер­ты для да­рэ­ння — 30 ты­сяч, ма­лень­кі руч­нік на іко­ну — 150 ты­сяч, а вя­лі­кі руч­нік — 300 ты­сяч руб­лёў. Дзе­ці за сваю пра­цу атрым­лі­ва­юць пры­клад­на трэць ад кош­ту. Пра­дук­цыю мож­на не толь­кі на­быць, але і ўзяць напра­кат. За­пла­ціць да­вя­дзец­ца 70 пра­цэн­таў той су­мы, у якую ацэнь­ва­ец­ца рэч. По­пыт заўсёды ёсць. Рэ­кла­ма­ваць сваю пра­дук­цыю біз­нес-кам­па­ніі да­зво­ле­на на сай­це шко­лы, пра­да­ваць су­ве­ні­ры да­па­ма­гае і «са­ра­фан­нае ра­дыё»: зна­ё­мыя, сяб­ры і ка­ле­гі. Па­куп­ні­кі, якія ўжо ма­юць до­ма «пра­дукт» ад школь­най біз­нес-кам­па­ніі, так­са­ма час­та рэ­ка­мен­ду­юць яе па­слу­гі. За мі­ну­лы год школь­ная біз­нес-кам­па­нія атры­ма­ла да­ход ка­ля 7 міль­ё­наў руб­лёў. А з па­чат­ку гэ­та­га го­да ў Пет­ка­ві­чах ужо па­спе­лі за­ра­біць ча­ты­ры міль­ё­ны руб­лёў. Пер­ша­па­чат­ко­выя ка­пі­та­лаў­кла­дан­ні ў школь­ны біз­нес бы­лі не­вя­лі­кі­мі. Спат­рэ­бі­ла­ся на­быць толь­кі спе­цы­яль­ную тка­ні­ну — кан­ву, якая ёсць у лю­бым буй­ным уні­вер­ма­гу, і ніт­кі для вы­шы­ван­ня.
У Пет­ка­ві­чах упэў­не­ны: для та­го, каб па­спя­хо­ва раз­ві­ваць біз­нес, трэ­ба ўмець адап­та­ваць ста­ра­даў­няе ра­мяст­во да су­час­нас­ці і ўвесь час са­чыць, што сён­ня ка­рыс­та­ец­ца асаб­лі­вай па­пу­ляр­нас­цю.
— Мы ха­це­лі б знай­сці маг­чы­масць пра­да­ваць сваю пра­дук­цыю пад­час чэм­пі­я­на­ту све­ту па ха­кеі, — дзе­ляц­ца пла­на­мі Ва­лян­ці­на Іва­наў­на і Га­лі­на Іва­наў­на. — На­прык­лад, мож­на бы­ло б вы­шыць абя­рэ­гі з ім­ёна­мі вя­до­мых ха­ке­іс­таў. За­меж­ным ба­лель­шчы­кам па­він­на спа­да­бац­ца.
Пры­га­жосць пет­ка­віц­кіх вы­ра­баў за­меж­ні­кі, да­рэ­чы, ужо аца­ні­лі. Ад­ной­чы ў шко­лу пры­еха­лі гос­ці з Ра­сіі. На той мо­мант ліш­ніх га­то­вых руч­ні­коў у шко­ле не ака­за­ла­ся, бы­лі толь­кі тыя, што за­хоў­ва­юц­ца як узо­ры. Але ра­сі­я­не та­кое тлу­ма­чэн­не не пры­ня­лі і доў­га ўпрош­ва­лі пра­даць ім бе­ла­рус­кі су­ве­нір. Іх вель­мі ўра­зі­ла, што та­кую кар­пат­лі­вую руч­ную пра­цу асво­і­лі дзе­ці, і бе­ла­рус­кія тра­ды­цыі не спы­ня­юц­ца вы­ключ­на на ба­бу­лях і дзя­ду­лях. Ёсць вы­шы­ва­ны па­да­ру­нак з Пет­ка­віч і ў мі­ніст­ра аду­ка­цыі Ар­ме­ніі, які атры­маў яго пад­час свай­го ві­зі­ту ў Мін­скую воб­ласць.
Га­лі­на Іва­наў­на і Ва­лян­ці­на Іва­наў­на ўпэў­не­ны: адзі­на­га сак­рэ­ту пос­пе­ху ў школь­най біз­нес-кам­па­ніі ня­ма. Тут трэ­ба і ўга­даць з ві­дам дзей­нас­ці, і за­ці­ка­віць дзя­цей, і са­мо­му быць за­хоп­ле­ным гэ­тай спра­вай. А што да­ты­чыць дзяў­чат, якія ўдзель­ні­ча­юць у біз­нес-кам­па­ніі, то яны, ня­гле­дзя­чы на ўзрост, па су­вя­зі з род­най куль­ту­рай пе­ра­ўзы­хо­дзяць не­ка­то­рых да­рос­лых. Ма­ла хто ве­дае та­кія фак­ты: на тра­ды­цый­ным руч­ні­ку не па­він­на пры­сут­ні­чаць бо­лей за сем сім­ва­лаў, а яго даў­жы­ня па­чы­на­ец­ца ад 1,5 мет­ра; ка­лі гэ­та руч­нік на іко­ну ці для хле­ба, яго ся­рэ­дзі­на па­кі­да­ец­ца не­вы­шы­ва­най, бе­лай і чыс­тай, а вось ру­ка­біт­ны руч­нік (яго вы­ка­рыс­тоў­ва­юць пад­час вя­сель­най цы­ры­мо­ніі) мае ар­на­мент па ўсёй даў­жы­ні.
Ад­на з юных май­стрых, Ка­ця­ры­на Эбер­гарт, рас­па­вя­ла, што ка­лі б на­цы­я­наль­ная вы­шыў­ка з'я­ві­ла­ся на су­час­ным адзен­ні, яна б з за­да­валь­нен­нем та­кое на­сі­ла. Гэ­та бы­ло б пры­го­жа, стыль­на і з сэн­сам. Ка­ця­ры­на і яе сяб­роў­кі па­куль не вы­шы­ва­юць ка­шуль, але атры­ма­нае ўмен­не дзе­цям у жыц­ці аба­вяз­ко­ва спат­рэ­біц­ца. На сваё вя­сел­ле дзяў­ча­там дак­лад­на не да­вя­дзец­ца на­бы­ваць руч­ні­кі. Не­ка­то­рыя з удзель­ніц біз­нес-кам­па­ніі, да­рэ­чы, ужо па­ча­лі вы­шы­ваць са­бе «па­саг».

The police had arrested a former contract employee of the forest department in connection with the forest fire at Mathigodu in Nagarahole range, in which more than 120 hectares of the forest area was reduced to ashes. In protest against the arrest, the Kaavadis and Mahouts have been staging a protest since Friday.
Without the mahouts to take care of the elephants, the forest department had let off the elephants inside the forest for food. As the forest is dry, the elephants returned back to the camp and started searching for food.
As they did not get any food, they went on rampage and damaged godown, kitchen and huts belonging to mahouts. On the other hand, four elephants which were caught near Hassan and have been lodged at Kraal in the camp are also not getting enough food.
Mahouts and kaavadis who had left the camp on Friday have arrived at the camp on Saturday. However, they did not perform their duties. Camp leader and ZP former member R K Chandru held talks with the protesters.
Thimma, mahout of senior elephant Balaram said “forest is source of our livelihood. We are not so cruel to set forest on fire. The forest department officials should give us justice,” he said.
Nagarahole ACF Shivashankar and RFO Devaraj held talks with the kaavadis and mahouts in the evening. The officials said “the police will act as per the law. We have to abide by the law.
If Vinu is innocent, he will walk free. During the interrigation he had stated that he ignited the fire to avenge his dismissal from the service.” Finally, the mahouts and kaavadis have withdrawn their stir in the evening.","Elephants go on rampage as mahouts, kaavadis continue stir"

https://www.newsday.co.zw/2014/04/castle-vumba/,"CONTINUING our Meikles Hotel wine-tasting tour up The Vumba, which we started, editorially, in yesterday’s Zimbabwe Independent at Inn on the Vumba, our second sampling was on the rugged turrets of a new venture at Leopard Rock, The Castle.
Travel with Dusty Miller
A well-known Vumba landmark, The Castle was built as a home for the Seymour-Smiths, the family which built and opened Leopard Rock in the 1940s.
In the 1980s it was bought by new owners and converted into a guest house, which operated until the early 2000s.
The property was acquired by Leopard Rock Hotel several years ago but has only recently been launched as a functions venue.
Byran Rocher, the new general manager at Leopard Rock (he was previously hotel and golf operations manager there) and I toured the main hotel earlier and after drinks on the magnificent terrace overlooking the award-winning 18-hole golf course on the border with Mozambique, drove a few hundred metres to the Gothic-style building with breath-taking views over the golf course and down to the once prosperous farming settlement of Burma Valley and across the border.
“The Castle is one of the most attractive buildings in the area, with walls made from local stone and views across surrounding valleys and mountains,” said Byran.
“It is now available to guests for a range of events and can host up to 100 people at a reception or up to 200 people in a marquee in its grounds. This makes it an extremely suitable venue for weddings, celebratory parties, conferences and training sessions.”
The Castle, which is on a hilltop across the grounds from the Leopard Rock Hotel, will be fully serviced with catering from the hotel. Guests using it will be accommodated in the main hotel; they have access to all facilities and amenities of the Leopard Rock resort.
“This venue has a long and colourful history, just like the hotel; we are sure it will prove popular as an innovative and exclusive centre for leisure and business activities,” said Byran.
He said the inclusion of The Castle within the selection of facilities and amenities available to Leopard Rock guests added innovation and excitement, and gave a further choice to individuals and organisations interested in activities in the Vumba mountains.
“This new development is very exciting and we are alerting the market to the availability of The Castle, something that has long been sought by conference and event organisers looking for something unusual,” he said.
Leopard Rock estate is high in the mountains, about 30km from Mutare, and its features include the hotel, a championship golf course designed by Peter Matkovich, private game park, casino and other leisure facilities, as well as conference and banqueting rooms within the hotel.
“The introduction of The Castle to our offerings will enhance the standing of Leopard Rock as the prime leisure and conference venue in the Eastern Highlands,” said Byran.
Well the proof of the pudding is definitely in the eating, I thought, as I plodded my way up several flights of steep steps to join a party already well under way on the open roof, surrounded by lichen-covered battlements.
En-route upwards I passed several bathrooms, one of which is known as “The Throne Room”. It has an ancient water closet sitting high on a natural rock feature!
Weather was superb; lovely sunshine filtered through powder puff clouds, the air was like champagne and although three or four spots of rain landed on my camera bag, the once threatening downpour never materialised.
Leopard Rock’s main kitchens had lain on a rather splendid and fairly lavish “finger-food” lunch.
Sadly that meant no cutlery was available. I’m not over fond of eating with my mitts, especially things lathered in sauces.
To my amazement the gleaming, pristine white table linen, and my golf shirt and shorts, remained in that state as much of the grub was eaten with cocktail sticks/toothpicks. Mandé Snyman, from Harare, entertained with country and western-type numbers and the wine tasting began.
I am hoping to be able to visit the KWV vineyards and brandy factory in The Cape later this month and, as an appetiser for that adventure, we coincidentally began with a KWV (Afrikaans abbreviation for Cape Wine Co-operative: it was founded in 1918) Shiraz rosé.
This proved (as expected) a delightfully light wine, perfect for drinking on its own in the open fresh air or great with salmon dishes or chicken breast in a curry cream sauce with mango. It would also go well with most seafood and summery salads.
KWV’s mantra is drinkability. Johan Fourie is the new head wine maker/ cellar master (he visited Zimbabwe recently) and makes a stunning just off-dry wine which is cherry blossom pink and bright in the glass with the flavours and nose of summer berries, wild strawberries, roadside brambles and fresh cranberries.
Next were two JC le Roux wines, ever popular with the ladies. Candidly, both were rather sweet for my palate and Le Chanson admits on the label to being sweet. It is a nutty red and non-vintage Methode Cap Classique blending Pinotage grapes with dashes of Shiraz and cabernet-franc.
Final tasting was of JC le Roux Le Domaine, which is a blend of sauvignon-blanc and Muscat grapes, with the sweetness of Muscatel definitely winning!
After a lovely light lunch and wine tasting some of our number went off to the nearby famous Tony’s Coffee Shop, to pay the infamous price of US$15 for (granted wonderful) cream cake and bottomless coffee.
I returned to the Inn on the Vumba to watch the nail-biting South Africa v England T/20 cricket game from Bangla Desh and have a bit of a rest before proceeding to the White Horse Inn for super and that night’s red wine-tasting. (Which you can read about in tomorrow’s issue of The Standard.)
Currently, visitors to The Vumba can enjoy a round of golf at Leopard Rock on a Sunday, followed by a grand braai lunch at the Clubhouse, for the give-away price of US$15, Byran revealed.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-view/women-must-lean-in-to-be-taken-seriously-in-the-political-sphere/story-khPh9NYffvpg0AV9MGOleJ.html,"It is self-evident that engaging in formal politics is engaging in claiming power or access to power, or to political spaces that are centres of power. And the power can be used in ways that are enabling to others and to lobbies or issues that the elected politicians represent. Given this axiom, it seems relevant to ask how far women’s demand for reserving seats in legislative councils will enable them to have the power to negotiate issues, concerns and rights that the women’s movement or the feminist movement wishes to affirm.
The argument here is that reserving seats for women in legislative councils does not necessarily mean that women’s voice and women’s quest for justice will be represented, leading to the proposition that reservation does not necessarily lead to representation.
If it is a question of women holding politically powerful offices, certainly we have a good profile in India. Apart from the leader of one of the major political parties and the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, we have the Speaker of the Lok Sabha — all women. And at a point in 2011 we had four women chief ministers. Neerja Chowdhury in an essay says: “Together these women ruled just under one-third of India — going by the Lok Sabha seats the four states accounted for — influencing the destinies of around 400 million Indians.”
But do these elected women represent women? And what does representing women mean?
In our view there are difficulties here. Chowdhury in the same essay perspicaciously unpacks the problematique of women in political parties.
First, most of such women enter politics as appendages of politically important men. Their role is to secure the men’s fiefdoms. They do not come representing women or a caste, community, trade union, farmers, etc.
Second, women’s demands, concerns, voice or manifestos are usually related to the areas of their physical engagement — reproductive rights, more crèches, proximate health services, proximate water, etc. So it is simple, put women to head the women’s ministry or health ministry. Therefore, women in formal politics, Chowdhury found, do not want to be stereotyped into this form of representation. They want the mainstream, as it is called. Hence, the reluctance of elected women to be solely identified with women’s voice.
Local self-government, ie the panchayati raj and the reservation of seats for women in this space, is often referred to as an illustration of success. It is a success in that it has made a difference to gender relations. Several very sophisticated surveys have been undertaken to test these views. A working paper by K Deininger et al. (2012) concludes that political reservation for women in India has an empowerment effect on them in terms of fewer hours of work at home. It also increases the extent to which women assert their reproductive choices and control their own resources. A significant increase in girls’ educational attainment was found, hinting at the fact that women sarpanches tend to spend more on education. E Duflo and R Chattopadhyay’s randomised controlled trial study in West Bengal and Rajasthan has indicated that when women lead local government, the priorities seem health, education and social services. However, another randomised study by I Rajaraman and M Gupta (2012) in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Odisha rejects the proposition that women as heads make choices that benefit their own gender.
Other studies suggest women-led panchayats make more altruistic choices for the public good, but they fail to show that women leaders raise gender issues. For example, there seems to be no evidence of an inverse relationship between women’s leadership and the incidence of violence against them.
Another study by Alexander Girard (2014) in Himachal Pradesh links the 33% reservation for women in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), the mandated quota, to canal management governance.
Reservation in jobs and education enhances a woman’s power and capability to negotiate gender relations. But that is different from reservation in elected assemblies. Therefore, the question remains as to how to ensure that women who enter assemblies or Parliament will ‘represent’ women. In our opinion, it has to be with the help of both reservation and the mobilisation of women voters, so that they can bargain with representatives of their block votes. This block voting is possible for categories, especially women workers. Such a process does not depend on the reservation of seats for women unless they are in fact the representatives of that category.
Now young women, including those from the Dalit and minority communities, are connecting and setting an agenda for equality and justice beyond bodily needs and fears. But unlike other identities, the identity of being a woman is difficult to translate into what is called a vote-bank. However, it is our view that if the women’s movement can forge a platform on the issues of economic policy, democratising economic agreements as well as party management, and the related issues of state federalism, they may make a bigger impact on the nation and in turn begin to gain representation in places of power.

https://www.zimbabwesituation.com/news/zimsit_how-zimbabwe-intelligence-organisation-siphoned-us70m-loan-facility/,"FURTHER details have emerged on how the shadowy CIO squandered US$70 million provided by the Chinese government through state-controlled financial institutions following hints on the issue by deputy foreign Affairs minister Chris Mutsvangwa last week.
Enquiries by the Zimbabwe Independent this week showed the Chinese government gave the CIO US$70 million for shady joint ventures, but the money was siphoned through fraudulent means via bogus front companies, including Farmers’ World formed in order to access loans.
In an interview this week with the Independent, Mutsvangwa said joint ventures were formed with the CIO in order to get government to guarantee the loans.
Mutsvangwa said Farmers’ World, a joint venture between the Chinese and CIO, failed to repay a loan to a Chinese state-controlled bank. “So they thought by using the CIOs in a joint venture they would get government as a guarantor and in so doing, they first got US$30 million and another US$40 million,” Mutsvangwa said. “Such loans under-performed, but the Chinese bank now has no way of recovery besides placing the loan in the books of government.”
This comes after reports by Global Witness last year CIO was given US$100 million for its operations ahead of the controversial 2013 elections. While this could not be independently verified, the CIO has not publicly confirmed or denied the report.
According to Global Witness, the CIO “appears to have received off-budget financing from Sam Pa, a businessman based in Hong Kong”.
It is said reliable sources showed how Sam Pa appears to have provided a significant sum of money, said by one intelligence document to be US$100 million, to the CIO. Global Witness also said Sam Pa provided 200 Nissan pick-up trucks to the CIO in return for diamonds and accessed business opportunities in the cotton and property development sectors.
In 2013 former Finance minister Tendai Biti said Treasury paid close to US$76,5 million in external loan repayments and the bulk of it went to China, with that of Farmers’ World also involved.
Prior to last year’s elections, MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai claimed CIO were running two operations codenamed “Operation Blackhawk” and “Operation Spider-web” financed to the tune of US$100 million in a bid to prevent him from winning the polls.",How Zimbabwe Intelligence organisation siphoned US$70m loan facility

He feels strongly about Modi ""propagating"" the slogan of a Congress-free India, which has left everybody ""shaken"", and the BJP leader's prediction that Lok Sabha polls will herald the end of Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, saying the family was ""symbolic representative of the unity of India"".
""Advani is the founder member of BJP, its former president. He wanted to contest from Bhopal but had to go back to Gandhinagar against his wish. Murli Manohar Joshi, also a former chief, wanted to contest from his old seat but had to shift.Jaswant Singh, an efficient foreign minister, good finance minister and Parliamentarian...Mr Modi decided to keep him away and he had to keep away and now he is contesting as an independent.
""I feel sorry about that. Modi wants to control his party. Of course it is his party and I cannot say anything but concentrated power always gets corrupt and it ultimately affects the common people,"" he told PTI in an interview.
Pawar again likened Modi to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.
""We have seen Hitler, he was elected from a democratic set up. He concentrated power in himself and the whole world has seen how he eliminated the Jews, attacked other people, misused authority. Today, the examples of Advani, Joshi and Singh are illustrative of how power has started concentrating in Modi's hand. It's just the beginning,"" Pawar said.
Pawar, a former Congressman, said people do not like Modi's idea of a Congress-free India and feels it could boomerang on BJP's PM hopeful.
""When Modi started his 'Congress mukt' mission, everybody was shaken. That hurt. People don't like the idea of a Congress-free India. Our own thinking is what we learnt from Nehru, Gandhi and Gandhian thinking. Babasaheb Ambedkar provided us a Constitution which gave tremendous power to the common people. I don't know why Modi raised this (slogan),"" Pawar said.
Asked if it can boomerang on Modi and BJP, Pawar said, ""I think so. When I go to villages and towns, people raise this issue.""
The NCP veteran also attacked Modi over his assertion that the Lok Sabha poll will mark the end of Nahru-Gandhi 'dynasty'.
""It is not the question of Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, it is the question of Nehru-Gandhi ideology. It is symbolic representative of a particular Congress ideology, of the unity of this nation, of secularism of this country.
""I don't think the glorious history of a country can be erased. Anybody can create history but nobody can destroy or eliminate the glorious history of a nation,"" he said.
Asked if Modi and BJP, having toned down their Hindutva rhetoric and talking of inclusive politics, would now be able to take all sections along, Pawar replied in the negative, saying once in power they will go back to contentious issues of Ram temple, uniform civil code and abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution.
""100 per cent. They have said about these things in their manifesto, may be not very prominently but at least something is there. Tomorrow, they can say, yes, we had told the people about our thinking,"" he said.
On whether he expected Modi, regarded an able administrator and a decisive leader, to end the policy paralysis alleged to be plaguing the government at the Centre, Pawar said the BJP leader's personalised style and data on development raised doubts about his being a competent administrator.","Pawar slams Modi, warns against ""power concentration"" in one man"

I was there, 20 years ago when Rajkumar Santoshi’s Andaz Apna Apna limped into theatres with no pre-release publicity in the same week as an Anil Kapoor film called Andaz which was houseful by the time we got to the ticket window. They offered us tickets to Andaz Apna Apna instead. My mother and I, like the people in line behind us, bought tickets for the next show of Andaz. No one wanted to watch a movie that had obviously hijacked the name of the current popular release, even if it starred chocolate boys du jour Salman Khan and Aamir Khan.
That film that we walked away from is now considered a cult classic. Writing about Andaz Apna Apna, I have realised, is like writing about mother’s love. Everyone has their own version of how it affects them, what lines they remember the most. A title that literally implies “to each his own”, this film has found its own place in Indian pop culture. And I was there.
Just like anyone who grew up in the 1980s could recount the Mahabharat scene from Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, anyone who grew up in the 1990s and early 2000s will be able to quote Andaz Apna Apna. Both were comedy films that didn’t fare well at release but garnered a following through television repeats and VHS/CD/DVD rentals. Any illegally-run movie rental shop from New York to Nerul in Mumbai will tell you how Andaz Apna Apna is a film, that once borrowed, does not come back without multiple viewings and much later than the due date.
One summer afternoon, while I lay on my stomach on the living room floor, like a dog cooling its belly, I watched the comedy for the first time on cable TV. I laughed so hard, I remember feeling my abs the next day. This was amazing, because at age nine, I didn’t even know what abs were. The movie was hilarious, but the internet did not exist to meme, quote, tweet, blog, and column the hell out of it.
The film is about Amar and Prem, two good-for-nothings who leave home after duping their respective fathers, to woo an heiress and her friend, Raveena and Karishma, (played by two of the most underrated comic actresses in Bollywood), Raveena Tandon and Karisma Kapoor. Andaz Apna Apna was a comedy film that did not make the women the punchline and allowed them both to match the men punch for punch. There was also a kidnapping subplot (that involves a bag of diamonds, obviously) and a double role played so deftly by Paresh Rawal — that turned his existing villian image on its head and established him as one of the finest talents on screen that was also showcased in another “cult” classic, Hera Pheri, in 2000.
Andaz Apna Apna was the first film in mainstream Bollywood to take a calculated dig at itself. The likes of Juhi Chawla and Govinda made appearances as themselves, humming songs from their own films. Comic legend Mehmood did a throwback to the “Wah Wah” productions from his another legendary comedy film Pyar Kiye Ja. The actors hammed freely, with Shakti Kapoor’s evil villain, Crime Master Gogo, proclaiming “Aaya hoon, kuch to loot kar jaunga … khandani chor hoon main, khandani … Mogambo ka bhatija, Gogo.”

The film was the harbinger of a generation that would sooner sell their dignity on national television in a Splitsvilla or a Bigg Boss than have to do any work really, where friendship and honesty were reduced to cliches. In one scene, Aamir Khan observes to his competitor Salman Khan, “Do dost ek pyale mein chai piyenge … isse dosti badti hai.” As Teja put it so eloquently, “Na surat, na shakal, na akal. Jise dekho chala aa raha hai.”
From playing slick, handsome heroes in their films, the Khan boys were like us — bumbling and struggling, hilariously idiotic and armed only with an arsenal of one-liners. And they still get the girl, and the diamonds and the approval of their families in the end! It held a mirror to us and the image it reflected was hilarious. Its makers, its characters and its audience, everyone knew that Andaz Apna Apna was a joke and we were all in on it.
But I never expected Crime Master Gogo or Teja to touch my life in the way that he did in 2002, when I met my bhabhi-to-be for the first time. It was weird to think of my older brother liking a girl. I was still being weaned from my Catholic schoolgirl revulsion for boys (Because if you talk to a boy…you will die. It’s a fact). And, suddenly, my brother liked a girl and no one was yelling at him about it. Instead, I was being made to put on a salwar kameez and meet her. She was very pretty, and I could tell my brother cared for her and she for him. But that did not quell my suspicions. As we walked out after lunch that day, I suddenly heard my mother say “Adu, your dupatta is dragging on the floor.” And, as I turned around, my to-be-bhabhi blurted, “Gogoji, apka ghaghra.” It struck me — she had been there as well. Our relationship flourished during multiple viewings of Andaz Apna Apna and breakfasts, where we praised each other’s efforts with “Bread ka badshah, omelette ka raja, Humara Bajaj.” Her knowledge of the film then made me realise that in the last decade or so, the internet in India had re-discovered Andaz Apna Apna, and the rest, as they say, is browser history.

Maybe the film was ahead of its time, or maybe it came at just the right time. A time when everyone had a sense of humour and no one in the cast came with glitzy PR agencies to make a fuss about a joke. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan today are two-thirds of the most powerful trio in the movie market; you’d be hard pressed to hear them say more than saccharine-laced bytes to each other. The memorable bus scene where the two heroes meet for the first time, and while exchanging platitudes of praise pass snide remarks at each other in smug voiceovers — “Circus ka retired bandar lagta hai” and “Shakal se to bidi ke kharkhane ka majdoor lagta hai” — seems to be ironic.
The 20-year anniversary was abuzz with rumours that Santoshi is making a sequel. A naughty picture of the two Khans urinating against a wall that did the rounds of social media also sparked rumours about the camaraderie of the two, and whether they will reprise it in Andaz Apna Apna 2. I don’t care. Because when the original came out— I was there. No, we were there.

“They cannot abrogate Article 370 till the Constituent Assembly is recalled. The Constituent Assembly approved accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India. If you want to raise the question once again, then you need to bring the Constituent Assembly and then we will talk,” Omar told reporters here.The Chief Minister was speaking as the row over the remarks of Minister of State in the PMO Jitendra Singh that efforts will be made to “convince” the “unconvinced” on abrogation of Article 370 continued to rage.Omar said the Centre should strengthen its relations with the State, but such a move will further alienate the people of Jammu and Kashmir.“You want to strengthen the State—Centre relationship but this is not the way. This will further widen the gap between the people of the State and the rest of the country which you will understand very soon. I can understand the political compulsion of the BJP, but first focus on other promises.

The Article 370 has nothing to do with the purchase of property here.“Before the Article 370, the State subject laws were enforced in the State by the Maharaja to save the people of Jammu who were apprehensive that rich Punjabis will come and buy their land.“If you see today, God forbid, if you play with our State subject laws, then even in such a situation nobody will come to Kashmir. If the land is purchased or anything of the kind happens, it will happen in Jammu region,” he said.Omar dismissed the assertion that the State subject laws were a hindrance in the development of Jammu and Kashmir.“The State subject laws protect our people. How are they a hindrance in the development of the State? If the State lacked in development it was because of the prevailing situation. Before (the eruption of militancy in) 1989, nobody complained of such a thing. Factories were being set up everywhere but nobody questioned the State subject laws.“This is not the only State in the country where this law is in force. There are other States where such laws are prevalent but nobody talks about them,” he said.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/our-urdu-s-keeper/story-uyB3llb0yfxzI1WhuDVOjK.html,"Is Hindi truly our national language? The debate is never-ending. Is Punjabi in danger? Listen to the songs to know. Is English our worst cultural enemy? Well, at least I continue to assault it every week in this column, 50 and counting.
Amidst this chaos, the poet’s beloved, a lyricist’s magic ingredient, and the most beautiful of our languages, Urdu, hits a quiet milestone in Chandigarh today. In room number 2 of SD College in Sector 32, as the latest batch sits for the sessionend exam, this June 30 ends the 38th year of free Urdu classes conducted by the Punjab language department. From July 1, a new batch of the six-month Urdu Amoz basic course will begin. And HK Lall, the teacher, will start all over again.
The story of these classes here — an admirable attempt to keep Urdu alive, besides efforts of university departments — is the story of Lall and his zest. A 77-year-old man of many words, he was born in Pakpattan in pre-partition Punjab. Given that he has a doctorate, you expect him to be a heavy-hearted, serious reader of couplets and all that. A couplet reader he is, but, in his lightness of being, he is much like the language he teaches. Urdu, he says, is about latafat (enjoyment), nazakat (softness), nafasat (finesse) and shireeni (sweetness). Latafat is apparent in his a joke-aminute disposition; nazakat in the way he tends to his hair; nafasat in the insistence on correct pronunciation; and shireeni comes through so sweetly in his personality.HK Lall, 77, the joyful teacher of the magic called Urdu, In Chandigarh. Photo: Abhishek Sethi/HT
But, for all his literary flair and this job, he was actually an employee of the Punjab irrigation department. “My office was in Sector 17, in the building next to Indian Coffee House (the one that housed Music World till recently). The ground floor had a showroom of Ramington typewriters, the first had BD Tailor, then was our office, and on top was the language department office. The language guys were looking for an Urdu teacher; someone told them I had an MA. The officer just walked down a floor, offered me an hour’s part-time work for Rs. 100 a month, and the class was set. Convenient for everyone!”
There were hiccups. For someone who had learnt his initial Urdu from his brother’s borrowed books and official papers of his father who worked in the irrigation department, Lall found it tough to teach. “The first time, I missed one of the 37 letters of the Urdu alphabet. Thank God, I had a doctor friend who encouraged me and gave me medicine for anxiety. Now, that’s my style — teaching the 37 letters over 19 days!”
His education, too, came in phases. After a failed shot at science, he did his Adib Fazil, diploma in Urdu, completing MA from Panjab University in 1969. As fate would have it, he landed in the irrigation department. In 1976, two years after the language department started the Urdu Amoz classes in Patiala, the scheme that now runs in 12 districts was expanded to Chandigarh. Lall’s calling had found him. In 1989, he completed PhD. Describing his irrigation department job, which he had till superannuation, he uses four words: “No work, no regrets.”
The one-hour evening job is what he lives for. It had started with around 40 students; half had left midway. This year, 102 enrolled; only 17 will take the exam. Most are male, both young and old. The oldest is 87.
What brings the students? “Most are just lovers of Urdu shayari (poetry).poetry).” Why do most
leave? “They get bored, maybe. Like Daag Dehlavi wrote, ‘Nahin khel hai Daag, yaaron se keh do; ke aati hai Urdu zabaan aate aate’ (This is no child’s play, let this be known; learning Urdu takes its own sweet time).”
About the state of Urdu, he refuses to be pessimistic. “There is so much Urdu in the Punjabi we speak; so much in our Hindi. Only the script is different.” He is repelled by the theory that Urdu is a language of Muslims: “What does religion have to do with it?” But how do we preserve Urdu’s entity here? “The government should introduce it as a subject in school. Until then, we may not learn its Persian script, but at least read and write more of it in Devanagari or even in the Roman script.”
How much is he paid? “From Rs 100, it was raised to Rs 250 after a decade, then Rs 500. In 2010, the then finance minister Manpreet Badal, a lover of Urdu, got it raised to Rs 2,500. That’s what I get.”
And does he write poetry? “I am no poet. But I end up writing poetry.” He ends with a couplet of his own, using a Hindi word and an analogy to underline a point and his love for Urdu: “Khidmat-e-Urdu karunga umar bhar; ye meri pooja, mera imaan hai. (Serve Urdu, I will, all my life; it is my worship, it is my faith.)”

The rail tracks were being laid down everything was going according to plan until of course it wasn’t.
It was news the past couple of weeks that the light railway tracks actually needed to be changed as it was not up to standard. Some commented that since we are dealing with China, the mother of cheapness and low quality products, why should this be any different?
Well, it should be different because we are talking about a mega national project. It should be standard all the way and we should never take anything below that. And fortunately we won’t have to; at least when it comes to the recent light railway track, the Chinese company will be taking responsibility and changing the tracks at its own cost. I also suggest that China should give Ethiopia a Panda Bear as a symbol of apology.
Talking about quality and standard, although maybe not when it comes to materials for big projects, but let’s say with consumer goods that we import into the country, clothes, shoes, furniture etc…we should be in a position to demand something good.
Although cheap products are very important, there is no point if they are also low quality and do not last for long. It seems like that is what is going on with most items that are on sale in shops, on street sides and in markets.
I have recently resorted to buying locally manufactured products as much as I can, especially those that are made well such as shoes, bags and the like. It is really encouraging to see some small manufacturers prospering and bringing to the table a good product that is very affordable.
The Ethiopian government is often encouraging the people to buy locally made products as it is really important for developing the manufacturing sector and growing the economy. But at the same time, the market is flooded with cheap low quality products and consumers are driven by the price of goods a majority of the time.
How is it possible to encourage local producers at the same time giving consumers an offer of cheap goods that they can’t refuse as their purchasing power is weak.
There is a whole other problem with locally manufactured goods as well. Although the quality is there the prices can also be very high, so high that they are out of many people’s buying capacity.
Another problem I have with those local companies in the country is that they export everything; export standard is a very good standard so obviously why would they sell some portion of it within the local market? But I think they should, there are actually some that export garments as well as sell some portion of their product locally and their business has flourished.
The point I am trying to make is that, when we for example think of China we think of cheap but when you go to Europe or the US, a lot of products are made in China just like we see in this country, but the difference in quality is a universe apart.
So what is the solution, can we tell traders or small business owners to bring in well made products and sell them at an affordable price? If that was possible, it would have been done by now.
Maybe this whole thing will blow over once we join the World Trade Organization and the country is overtaken with foreign banks willing to loan money, malls run by Multinational Corporations and super markets and what not.

“I used to only send greeting cards to close friends when I was a teenager. Now I send my greetings through Whatsapp, email, SMS and phone calls.
“I think buying and mailing greeting cards take too much time,” she admitted.
At Borders book store in the Bangsar Village II shopping complex, manager-in-training who only wanted to be known as Erna said the sales of Raya cards this year was not as encouraging as in previous years.
“Those who buy the cards mostly choose the 5-in-1 or 6-in-1 promotional packets as they are cheaper.”
The same trend is evident at MPH bookstore in Bangsar, where the Raya cards sales is “just okay”, according to a retail executive who identified herself as Pushpa.
“I am familiar with the customers who buy these cards as they come every year,” she said noting that most of them are those who work near the shopping complex where the book store is.
“We are selling 5-in-1 packets of Raya cards at RM4.90 and RM9.90 each and these two packets are the best-sellers.”
The dying tradition of sending festive cards is also indicated in the total number of Hari Raya cards delivered by Pos Malaysia over the last few years.

It is also interesting to note that 60 per cent of the cards were mailed form the National Mail Centre in Shah Alam while the least number of cards were mailed from Sabah.
Pos Malaysia maintains that despite digital communications, sending greeting cards is still a heritage held dear by Malaysians during festive seasons.
Last year, the national courier offered a promotional rate of 50 sen for postage of Hari Raya greeting cards to anywhere in Malaysia as opposed to the normal postage rate of 60 sen for items weighing below 20g and 70 sen for items below 50g. The promotional rate is also offered this year.
“With the changing trends in communication which sees the use of social media, mobile and electronic alternatives, we understand that people prefer these alternatives.
“However, many Malaysians still value the personal touch of sending a greeting card to wish their friends and loved ones — a practice we encourage,” said a spokesman for Pos Malaysia.
Memory Lane cards corporate sales manager Chan Kong Yuen echoes the sentiment, and saying that e-cards or wishes sent through digital platforms do not possess the sentimental value greeting cards do.
He said the sales of Hari Raya greeting cards made by Memory Lane have gone down because of competition from other greeting cards companies and people’s dependence on the Internet and smartphones.
“Our business is not only hurting because of social media and instant messaging but also e-greeting cards.
“We stick to the traditional method of printing our custom-made cards and designs but to catch up with the times we also sell them online per customers’ requests, especially during Hari Raya and Chinese New Year”.
To encourage sales, Chan said they sell value packs containing 10 cards each as well as engage in email marketing every time a festive season is around the corner.
A spokesman from greeting card company Carduta said sales had dropped over the years, especially in the recent decade.
“These days corporate customers generate our sales whereas 10 years ago the bulk of our sales were generated by the retail market.”
The company uses Facebook and its website to promote its greeting cards and to connect with the younger crowd and encourage them to take up this dying ritual.",Fewer greeting cards in the mail

People who had come to enjoy their Sunday evening on the Kozhikode beach were drawn towards the enormous kite due to obvious reasons.But when they knew the kite was being flown to anchor a protest against war in Gaza and in general, they gladly joined hands with the organisers and cried out at their top voices ‘Save Gaza. We don’t want any more war’.“Artist protest by painting. Writers write to express their protest. We protest in a way we could,” said Abdulla Maliyekkal, founder and CEO of One India Kite Team that has made it big in many an international kite festival.“Hundreds of children are dying in Gaza.

This kite, designed by the One India Kite team and manufactured by Peter Linen in New Zealand, had bagged the second prize for best design at the International Kite Festival in Weifang, China in 2013. “The kite made using nylon has 80 cells in it and was made at a cost of Rs.75,000,” Mr.Maliyekkal said.Fifteen members of the One India team, including Shabeer Unity, Rajesh.K and Anoop.K.Francis had been at the venue to take part in the protest.

Dodoma. The government has said properties owned by Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) locally and overseas cannot service its Sh133 billion debt.
Instead, plans are afoot to look for immediate and necessary measures that would see the debts ATCL accumulated over the years due to poor management cleared to ensure that business at the state-owned airline continues as usual.
Yesterday, the deputy minister for Transport, Dr Charles Tizeba, said however, that all routes that ATCL used to have were still in operation and that each time it got a flight, the routes continued as usual.
The deputy minister who was responding to a supplementary question posed by Lucy Owenya (Special Seats- Chadema) said soon, the government would start selling tickets through ATCL to South Africa if the negotiations will materialize.
Ms Owenya wanted to know the number of planes owned by the embattled company and government’s plans to revive it.
According to Dr Tizeba, the company has currently one plane that carries 50 passengers plying Dar es Salaam, Tabora, Kigoma, Mtwara and Bujumbura routes. He added that starting May 21, 2014, ATCL started supplying services to Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar.
Dr Tizeba added that the company also borrowed another plane from Kenya that also carries 50 passengers serving Dar es Salaam, Mwanza, Mbeya, Mtwara and Comoro.
ATCL according to the deputy minister intends to purchase two more planes that will have the capacity to carry 78 passengers each that will traverse Nairobi, Uganda and Kigali and that they will be in the country before the end of this year.","BUDGET 2014/15: ATCL drowning in Sh133 billion debt, says govt"

“This week I am bringing over 100 leaders from 30 African nations as well as Russia, China, India and the US. I want them to see what is happening in this country and to see the growth, development and progress that has been made in both this nation and its churches as we prepare for the 2015 gathering.”

But, Dear Pastor, do you really understand what is a growth, development and progress? Simply I understand your model of growth.
Dear Pastor, you talked about the growth but I failed to understand in which domain you referred to. Let assume that you referred to the growth hacking introduced by Sillicon Valley and now you are a current strategist in that matter in order to boost your revenues from a poor country like Rwanda. In addition, if you referred to economic growth, dear Pastor, I think that you’re aware that Rwandan private and public sectors are fully dominated by the ruling party FPR in its umbrella Crystal Venture Limited under direct control of your student Paul Kagame.
Development. Pastor R. Warren missed a point when praising Kagame with a word development. Dear pastor, talking about development you referred to what in Rwanda? Here you should focus on specific issues if not so, we know that many issues in rwanda are developing including fires, killings, putting in jails opponents, lies in statistics, etc. Dear Pastor, as one african singer point out : Please put a little love as a preacher

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/632925/sc-denies-plea-to-disqualify-3-justices-from-hret,"MANILA, Philippines—The Supreme Court denied the petition to disqualify Supreme Court Associate Justices Presbitero Velasco Jr., Diosdado Peralta and Lucas Bersamin from membership of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET).
Marinduque Representative Regina Ongsiako Reyes, through her lawyer Harry Roque Jr. , sought the disqualification of the three and be substituted with other high court justices. Reyes has a pending disqualification case before the HRET.
ADVERTISEMENT
In her petition, they cited alleged conflict of interest on the part of Justice Velasco since his son, former congressman Lord Allan Velasco, stands to benefit should the HRET disqualify her.
Velasco, being the most senior of the three justices, chairs the HRET and has already inhibited himself from the proceedings of the tribunal as well as in the proceedings of the Supreme Court involving his son’s case.
However, Reyes said Velasco’s continued stay at the HRET in relation to his son’s case has become untenable.
“The Supreme Court runs the risk of incurring historical infamy if it ignores this unprecedented scenario and contents itself with a complacent and run-of-the-mill inhibition by the Justice-Father from the case, even if said Justice/Father/HRET-Head still retains administrative control and moral suasion, and enjoys collegial camaraderie in the HRET,” Reyes said.
Reyes lamented the speedy action of the HRET on the petition-in-intervention by a certain Victor Sioco despite failure to pay the required docket fees, which should have been a ground for its summary dismissal.
The high court, in its recent ruling, said the petition sought the wrong remedy and that, in any event, there was no grave abuse of discretion alleged nor shown.

With help from a local NGO working with talented students like her, she has her curriculum material in place just in time to begin today’s lessons.Within minutes of logging into the network on her mobile phone, she is connected to her mentor from the U.K. who takes her through the techniques of weaving. With mentorship from a college in the U.K., and help from the NGO, it seems like her dream will be a reality soon.This can be a reality for several rural talents in India, all thanks to the growing scope of long distance education and mobile learning (m-learning).According to a report, penetration of m-learning is around 7 per cent to12 per cent in India, which is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. It is a boon for people like Anu who have the intelligence and want to pursue education but may not have adequate infrastructure in her locality to pursue her dream. Even the remotest areas in the country have mobile networks, and it is thus the most effective way to reach out to millions.Reaching outThe key drivers of growth in this sector include high portability, small size, low price, adaptable technology of mobile devices, and, most importantly, its increasing penetration in the country. However, to fully realise this potential we need all Indians to have the opportunity to acquire the education, training and skill that fully leverages their capability.Thus reaching out to millions of students who may have acquired basic education through local schools but fail to continue in higher education or vocational training to be employment — ready is a greater challenge for the country.This is where e-learning can help. Even with long-distance learning through computers, there remains an issue of accessibility of machines, especially in rural areas.Mobile phones play a significant role in this regard and are definitely more affordable as a gadget than a personal computer or laptop. Thus, if applications can be developed to make learning through personal phones possible , it is the easiest and cheapest way to educate millions of youth.M-learning can play a crucial role in reaching those who are outside the scope of traditional schooling, and will enable them to access various educational programmes.For the futureMobile technology can help address many development issues, for example, banking, health information and agricultural services. Realising the immense potential, several telecoms have started offering m-education services. Given below are some of the key factors:Convenience and flexibilityManagement: allows each person to have a personalised way of learning.
Relevance: gives learners what they need, when they need it.
Allows use of unproductive time such as when travelling or waiting.Special education: for the benefit of learning-challenged individuals.
Interactive: allowing teachers to personally communicate with each student.
Collaborative: students from different locations can interact and work together.
The day is not far when all kinds of training and vocational courses will be made available through mobile phones.The writer is chief mentor, Achiever’s Zone.

It has not only brought diverse talents on a single arena but has also given the opportunity for a creative community to grow and flourish.
‘Tabula Rasa’, a group show of painting and photography, organised by Artz Fine Art Gallery, recently, is one such forum where creativity was in full display.
The Latin term ‘Tabula Rasa’ means a ‘blank slate’. It originates from the Roman tabula or a wax tablet used for notes, which was blanked by heating the wax and then smoothing it, to give a ‘tabula rasa’. However, in the context of the exhibition it is a ‘new beginning’, of starting afresh with new ideas, creations
and concepts.
The show, which ended recently in the City, focused mainly on photography and paintings and put forward a contrasting picture between these two mediums. We all know that paintings are the reflection of mindscapes on canvas, where colours, other artistic tools, human subconscious and imagination play a major role.
Whereas photography directly brings out one’s perception via captured images
The exhibition based on ‘plurality of concept and diversions on vision’, showcased creative photography from five young photographers and paintings by five
enthusiastic painters.
Speaking about this show, the curator Debabrota Das enthusiastically said, “Photography and painting are two important sections of visual art and they serve the craving of modern and young art enthusiasts. Such an exhibition is not happening for the first time in the art world, in fact, these days creating or doing something is a nail biting job. But the way I have planned this show is very substantial and genuine. After considering the work of almost 100 artists, we selected few for the show and the unifying factor is their honesty towards work and hunger for change.”

Aquino brought a gift for Ione Malloy, the retired American schoolteacher who had bought the house more than a decade ago.
Mah-jongg, informal dinners
Dr. Mario Bucal, a good friend of the late Sen. Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr. in Boston, also joined the President in his nostalgic return to the house that saw a lot of mah-jongg games and informal dinners.
The President spent some 30 minutes inside the house with his friends, Doctor Bucal and Malloy. It was a private meeting, which members of the media were not allowed to cover. Coverage of the visit was limited to a photo and video opportunity outside the house.
Aquino was overheard by Inquirer photographer Edwin Bacasmas sharing his stories with friends as they ambled on the sidewalk after emerging from the house.
The President said he shoveled the heavy snow on the sidewalk and their driveway, not an easy task considering the bitter winters in Massachusetts.
An elderly American couple, John Paul and Rebecca Valette, patiently waited for Aquino outside the house. And when he got near them, Rebecca introduced herself as the Aquinos’ neighbors and pointed to him where they lived.
Cute
The anecdote on the “cute neighbor,” as Bacasmas heard from one of the President’s friends, was the closest one got in satisfying the curiosity about whether Aquino dated anyone while in Boston.

At 54, the President remains a bachelor.
Going to No. 175 Commonwealth Avenue on Chestnut Hill, an affluent neighborhood in this town, was perhaps the highlight of the President’s homecoming to Boston since returning to the Philippines in 1983 to bury his slain father.
Emotional
In a speech at Boston College on Sunday, Aquino said he knew that going back to Boston for the first time after 31 years would be an emotional moment for him.
The three years he spent with his father, mother Cory and four sisters in the red brick, two-story house were obviously the happiest moments they had as a family.
Boston and the friends they made there, Aquino said, gave his family a sense of normalcy amid “abnormal” times, referring to the brutality of martial law. It was a “home away from home,” he said.
His father, one of the leading opposition figures against the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, was in jail for seven and a half years, before an urgent heart surgery in 1980 became the family’s ticket to seek exile in the United States.
Formative years
But even in America, Ninoy continued to fight Marcos, giving speeches and media interviews where he talked about how Filipinos had suffered from an autocratic rule and how a few raided the national coffers.
The time he spent in Boston was also his formative years, Aquino said, in imbibing his father’s fight for freedom and democracy.
Before going to Commonwealth Avenue, the President shared a pizza with US Rep. Joseph Kennedy III at Bill’s Pizzeria, said to be one of Mr. Aquino’s favorites when his family lived in exile in Boston.
The meeting with Kennedy was limited to a photo opportunity.
Scions of political greats
At press time, details of the 30-minute meeting between the scions of their countries’ most influential political families had yet to be released.
Kennedy is the grandson of the late US Sen. Robert Kennedy and grandnephew of US President John F. Kennedy.
On a recent visit to Manila, the 33-year-old Kennedy invited Aquino to a meeting should he travel to Massachusetts.
A statement from the Office of the President said that Aquino met with several American companies on Monday afternoon (early Tuesday morning in Manila).

Horticulture as a non-traditional export for Uganda had not only brought hope to the lives of many smallholder farmers as a source of income but also created jobs. Flowers, for instance, have created jobs for more than 8,5000 Ugandans.  In an interview with Prosper magazine, the Commissioner of external trade in the Ministry of Trade, Mr Silver Ojakol, said a notification from Brussels-Belgium, one of Uganda’s major EU market destinations has been issued to Uganda.“There is a notification from Brussels about this matter and the line ministry of agriculture is working on an action plan to rectify the matter,” Mr Ojakol shared.According to information in the notification from Brussels, Ugandan exporters failed to comply with the phytosanitary certification requirements.The standardsIdeally a phytosanitary certification is issued to indicate that consignments of plants, plant products or other regulated articles meet specified import requirements and are in conformity with the certifying statement of the appropriate model.In the notification, Belgium found traces of live insects in the mentioned commodities, something which is risky to human lives.CauseAccording to the Horticultural Exporters Association (Hortexa) chairman, Mr John Lule, “There are so many middlemen who have failed to follow the traceability system and instead just buy commodities from any farmer. This has ruined the quality of exports,” he says“An exporter has to comply with traceability system so that if there is a problem-say if a chemical which is dangerous for human consumption was used, it can be linked to its source,” Mr Lule added.He called upon government to arrest this situation to avoid losing revenue and credibility.Government’s reactionsThe Commissioner for crop resources in the ministry of Agriculture, Dr Okasai Opolot, in an interview with Prosper magazine, said: “We have agreed to conform to the EU regulations in order to keep the trade relations.”He said government intends to deregister the companies which do not comply with the EU Phytosanitary safety standards.Numbers about Uganda’s flower exports6,500 tonnes :Export volume of flowers in 2013.

Senator Thomas Grupee said, Nimba County is the second county in the Republic that has suffered huge causality at the hands of the virus. He added that the huge hit is due to the fact that Nimba is a Border County.
According to him, since the outbreak, both local authorities and the Legislative Caucus are working closely to ensure that the situation is put under control. As a means of helping people of Nimba in the fight against the deadly virus, citizens of county residing in Monrovia and environs hosted a fund-raising rally at the Antoinette Tubman Stadium at which time about US$12,000 was realized.
“Mr. Musa Bility provided US$5,000 and I gave US$1000 plus some flyers to create the awareness about the deadly spread. With the little generated from the short-notice rally, it puts the county in a better position to combat the virus,” he said, further noting that despite the county being next to Montserrado County in terms of medical facilitates, not much is seen as it relates to medication and fast treatment for the people.
“Nimba County has 64 medical facilitates- four hospitals and 54 clinics. Those facilitate lack medicines and qualified health workers; worse of it, government’s support is not forthcoming,” he said. To buttress the effort of the government, the authorities of the county, in close consultations, withdrew US$10,000 from the county’s coffers to buy medications, improve the road network, and create more awareness.
“We also withdrew US$34,000 for transportation, and improve the road network, but interestingly, the nine electoral districts representatives and students from the county have join the wagon of creating awareness,” the Nimba County Senator noted.
According to him, there are three ambulances in the county, along with a few pickup trucks; but he has received reports that all ambulances were currently down, making it difficult to transport suspected patients. Grupee, also chairman of the Nimba County Legislative Caucus, expressed disappointment at the form and manner the government was distributing the US$5 million borrowed from the Central Bank of Liberia for the Ebola fight.
He explained that Nimba County, as big as the county was, received only US$2,000 to combat the virus- something he termed as a mockery and a clear joke. He also disclosed that there were seven quarantined centers in the county, for which the caucus and the superintendent office pursuing food and medical supplies these.",Ebola kills 41 in Nimba

According to official figures available here, Qadirabad Headworks had discharged 948,530 cusecs in the 1992 floods which had been counted as the worst-ever floods in the country. However, now River Chenab has returned to normalcy in the area and is discharging only 93,720 cusecs. The floodwater inside the protective bund has started receding gradually and it was expected that the affectees rehabilitation would start after a forth night.
The flash flood had wrecked havoc with more than 200,000 population in 200 villages located on the left bank of River Chenab. So far deaths of six persons and injuries to 70 persons have been confirmed. Estimates of the loss of crops and houses and animals are being made and according to the official figures standing crops over 100,000 acres of land have been partially damaged or washed away. Due to breach in the Lower Chenab Canal more than 600 feet of Gujranwala-Hafizabad Road has been washed away on Sunday evening which could not be made operational so far. The bridge of QB Link Canal has also been badly damaged due to the breach which direly needed repair on war footings.
According to villagers, snakes have been found in large numbers in the affected areas and one snake bite incident has also been reported recently but it was irony of fate that anti-rabbi vaccine was not available in any of the hospitals in the district.

China, renowned for its internet censorship, is host to over 350 million offline people.A large chunk of Indonesia's population, around 210 million are offline, while about 150 million are offline in Bangladesh. Surprisingly, in the United States, 50 million people still don’t use the internet.[infogram url=""
The study states that majority of the world’s offline population, which is about 64%, live in rural areas where there is poor healthcare, education and employment.While the study says only 11% of Pakistanis are online, the figure is only slightly less than the government's official figures which state that as many as 30 million Pakistanis have access to the internet, or nearly 17% are online.However, only a fraction of those online are connected via broadband internet with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority putting broadband subscriptions at 3.6 million.Even with broadband, the average speed of itnernet in Pakistan is much slower than some of the neighbouring countries.According to netindex.com , Pakistan has an average broadband speed of just 3.2 Megabits per second (Mbps). In contrast India has an average broadband speed of 5.7 Mbps.Iran, which is known for its severe restriction of online content, much like China, can boast average speeds of 4.2 Mbps.Only neighbouring Afghanistan has lower speed than Pakistan with average broadband speeds of 2.9 Mbps.What is promising, however, the average speed in Pakistan has risen from 2.31 Mbps last year to 3.2 Mbps this year.With the advent of 3G and 4G LTE services this year, the access to and average speed of internet is expected to rise significantly as companies seek to tap into the 80% cellular penetration in the country which has nearly 140 million cellular subscriptions.However, getting all of the 140 million subscribers access to 3/4 G may not be as easy. The study notes that between 1.1 billion and 2.8 billion cannot get online via a mobile network because they do not live within sufficient mobile network coverage.

KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 28 ― Activist Ali Abdul Jalil’s decision to flee to Sweden to escape his sedition charges shows that the youth lacks the courage to face the consequences of his actions, Attorney-General Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail said.
Abdul Gani said local activists who dare to break the law should be brave enough to face the music for their actions, instead of running away to seek political asylum elsewhere.
“Why need to run… if (you) dare to do it, then should be brave to tanggung (bear it).
“For all activists...you must answer to what you have done, so don’t have to worry run here and there. You know the consequences and you have to answer,” the chief public prosecutor was quoted saying by local daily Berita Harian today.
According to news portal Rakyat Times’s report last Saturday, Ali left Malaysia on October 18 and flew from Bangkok to Sweden three days later, where he contacted the Swedish chapter of Amnesty International upon arrival for advice on applying for political asylum.
Ali was subsequently interviewed by the local immigration authorities last Thursday where he reportedly disclosed the full details of his court cases back home, and is now awaiting the results of his application.
In a status update on Facebook on October 25, Ali accused the Malaysian government of treating him like “rubbish”, claiming that he was no longer safe in his home country as he had received a number of threats from “gangsters and racist Malay groups in Malaysia”.
Last month, Ali was arrested four times for sedition investigations on his alleged insults against the royalty and spent three weeks in prison.
The 29-year-old was finally freed on September 29 after the series of arrests against the activist who was passed from one police district to another over the same alleged offence.
On September 8, Ali was charged in the Selayang Sessions Court with sedition for allegedly insulting the Johor royal house on Facebook, before being rearrested after posting bail of RM5,000.
He was then hauled to the Shah Alam Sessions Court on the same day and charged with two counts of sedition for allegedly insulting the Selangor Sultan and for undermining the royal institution, refusing to be bailed and choosing to stay in jail until September 23.
On September 23, Ali was released on a bail of RM8,000 but was rearrested and taken from Shah Alam to Johor.
He has yet to be charged in Johor.
Ali was among the 15 anti-government dissidents and opposition politicians who were arrested under the colonial-era Sedition Act 1948 in the space of one month.

З той жа эпо­хі па­хо­дзяць рэ­цэп­ты «шам­пан­ска­га» з сы­ро­ват­кі або абяс­тлу­шча­на­га ма­ла­ка, хлеб­ных су­ха­роў, фрук­то­вых і ягад­ных со­каў, якія не спра­ба­ва­лі пад­ма­нуць спа­жыў­ца на­конт па­хо­джан­ня на­пою, але да­ва­лі яму сціп­лую ра­дасць ад су­зі­ран­ня імк­лі­вых бур­ба­лак і спа­та­лен­ня сма­гі... Не­ка­то­рыя мяс­цо­выя га­тун­кі «шам­пан­ска­га» бы­лі па­пу­ляр­ны­мі да са­май Дру­гой су­свет­най вай­ны. Ад­ной з леп­шых «сум­лен­ных імі­та­цый» бы­ло пе­ніс­тае ві­но з агрэс­та — яго рэ­цэпт мож­на пра­чы­таць і ў сла­ву­тай «Лі­тоў­скай гас­па­ды­ні» Ган­ны Цюн­дзя­віц­кай.

У паэ­ме Ада­ма Міц­ке­ві­ча «Пан Та­дэ­вуш» у ад­ным мес­цы кры­ты­ку­юц­ца праг­ныя гас­па­да­ры, якія ашча­джа­юць на са­праўд­ных доб­рых ві­нах, най­перш на ўлю­бё­ных шлях­тай ву­гор­скіх:
Не раз кры­чыць па­ніч, што ён не цер­піць збыт­каў,
А ску­піц­ца гас­цей кар­міць, па­даць на­піт­каў,
Вен­гер­ска­га шка­дуе, це­шыц­ца ша­тан­скім
Мас­коў­скім сфаль­ша­ва­ным ней­кім там шам­пан­скім.
Тут спля­лі­ся ра­зам не­да­вер да пад­ро­бак, якія за­па­ла­ні­лі ры­нак, і рэ­флек­тор­ная не­пры­яз­насць да ўся­го мас­коў­ска­га, ра­сій­ска­га, ха­рак­тэр­ная для шлях­ты, заўж­ды га­то­вай да чар­го­ва­га паў­стан­ня. Хоць прэ­тэн­зіі да якас­ці ра­сій­ска­га на­пою, маг­чы­ма, бы­лі не­аб­грун­та­ва­ны­мі. На­прык­лад, шам­пан­скае гра­фа Ва­ран­цо­ва з крым­ска­га ма­ёнт­ка Ай-Да­ніль бы­ло год­ным на­по­ем, як і ін­шыя леп­шыя ўзо­ры ві­на­роб­ства на поўд­ні ім­пе­рыі, і толь­кі шмат­ве­ка­вая ва­ро­жасць і га­нар­лі­васць не да­зва­ля­лі пры­знаць за імі яў­ныя вар­тас­ці. Ну, а са­мо па­зна­чэн­не «шам­пан­скае» ў той час яшчэ не бы­ло аба­ро­не­на па пры­кме­це геа­гра­фіч­на­га па­хо­джан­ня.
Але чым блі­жэй да на­ша­га ча­су, тым усё больш за­ла­годж­ваў­ся ў яс­на­вель­мож­ных па­ноў не­да­вер да пе­ніс­тых ві­наў ра­сій­ска­га па­хо­джан­ня, асаб­лі­ва ка­лі ў кан­цы XІX ста­год­дзя за­блі­шчэ­ла сла­ва за­во­да кня­зя Га­лі­цы­на ў крым­скім жа Но­вым Све­це. Але, вя­до­ма, фран­цуз­скія мар­кі заў­сё­ды ша­на­ва­лі­ся вы­шэй. На­прык­лад, для су­стрэ­чы Но­ва­га 1912 го­да ў Мен­ску він­ная кра­ма Ю. Кі­та­і­на пра­па­ноў­ва­ла шам­пан­скае ма­рак: «Mumm», «Monopole», «Pommery», «Clіcquot», «Roederer», «Moet & Chandon», «Crystal» па кош­це... ад 60 коп. за бу­тэль­ку (да­ва­ен­ных цар­скіх ка­пе­ек!). Шам­пан­скае ў апош­нія дзе­ся­ці­год­дзі Ра­сій­скай ім­пе­рыі на­столь­кі ста­ла аса­цы­я­вац­ца з даб­ра­бы­там і пос­пе­хам, што змаг­ло вы­ста­яць на­ват у са­вец­кую эпо­ху, ка­лі ідэа­ла­гіч­ныя ўла­ды жорст­ка зма­га­лі­ся з пра­ява­мі бур­жу­аз­на­га ла­ду жыц­ця, ні­чым не больш «рас­пус­ны­мі», чым пе­ніс­тае ві­но.
З 1937 го­да іс­нуе мар­ка «Са­вец­кае шам­пан­скае» — сім­вал поў­най і кан­чат­ко­вай пе­ра­мо­гі са­цы­я­ліз­му, якая вы­пус­ка­ла­ся на шмат якіх за­во­дах бы­ло­га СССР. У 1978 го­дзе яго па­ча­лі вы­раб­ляць так­са­ма і ў Мін­ску, які да гэ­та­га ні­ко­лі не прэ­тэн­да­ваў на ро­лю ві­на­роб­на­га цэнт­ра. 17 лю­та­га на кан­ве­е­ры з'я­ві­ла­ся пер­шая бу­тэль­ка, а 23 лю­та­га ад­бы­лі­ся пер­шыя роз­ніч­ныя про­да­жы. Уся­го за лю­ты 1978 го­да бы­ло вы­пу­шча­на... толь­кі 2000 бу­тэ­лек. Бо прак­тыч­на ўсе апе­ра­цыі ра­бі­лі­ся ўруч­ную. А сён­ня за 1 га­дзі­ну на кан­ве­е­ры вы­раб­ля­ец­ца 8000 бу­тэ­лек. Гус­ты сён­няш­ніх па­куп­ні­коў па­сту­по­ва на­блі­жа­юц­ца да су­свет­ных трэн­даў, ад паў­са­лод­кіх да паў­су­хіх і су­хіх ма­рак.
Ня­даў­на ў бе­ла­рус­ка­моў­ным ася­род­дзі паў­ста­ла спрэч­ка, што вы­лі­ла­ся і ў ан­лайн-га­ла­са­ван­не: як на­зы­ваць пе­ніс­тыя ві­ны па-бе­ла­рус­ку? Асаб­лі­ва ка­лі пра­ві­лы між­на­род­на­га ганд­лю, Су­свет­най ганд­лё­вай ар­га­ні­за­цыі з ця­гам ча­су не­па­збеж­на пры­му­сяць ад­мо­віц­ца ад тэр­мі­на «шам­пан­скае». З вя­лі­кім ад­ры­вам па­куль лі­дзі­руе сло­ва «шум­лі­вае», ад «шум» — «пе­на», бліз­кае, да­рэ­чы і да ста­ра­жыт­на­га чэш­ска­га эпі­тэ­та та­ко­га ві­на (sumіve vіno). Гэ­тае сло­ва, па­вод­ле іні­цы­я­та­раў га­ла­са­ван­ня, най­больш ад­па­вя­дае ўнут­ра­най ло­гі­цы бе­ла­рус­кай мо­вы. Што ж, не бу­дзем за­бы­вац­ца, што гла­ба­лі­за­цыя на­сту­пае ня­ўмоль­на, і цал­кам маг­чы­ма, што пра «шам­пан­скае» бе­ла­рус­кай вы­твор­час­ці да­вя­дзец­ца ўсё ж за­быць. І та­ды ад­мет­нае бе­ла­рус­кае сло­ва бу­дзе ў ца­не. Як cava ў Іс­па­ніі, francіacorta, prosecco, lambrusco і bracchetto ў Іта­ліі, sekt у Гер­ма­ніі, wіno musujace ў Поль­шчы. Так што па­жа­да­ем пос­пе­ху на­шым вы­твор­цам, а спа­жыў­цам — не толь­кі маг­чы­мас­ці вы­бі­раць, але і глы­бо­кіх ве­даў як вар­тас­цяў роз­ных на­по­яў, так і ай­чын­най гіс­то­рыі.
Ка­рот­кі на­рыс гіс­то­рыі пе­ніс­та­га ві­на
Ві­но з агрэс­ту шы­пу­чае, па­доб­нае да шам­пан­ска­га
Па­вод­ле «Лі­тоў­скай гас­па­ды­ні»
Со­рак фун­таў (1 фунт роў­ны 410 г) агрэс­ту, не зу­сім спе­ла­га, раз­мі­на­юць, не рас­ці­ра­ю­чы зяр­ня­ты, і раз­баў­ля­юць у трыц­ца­ці двух фун­тах рач­ной ва­ды. Су­месь па­кі­да­юць ста­яць спа­кой­на двац­цаць ча­ты­ры га­дзі­ны. По­тым праз мяш­кі моц­на вы­ціс­ка­юць, па­ло­шчуць яшчэ раз ва­дой і пра­цэдж­ва­юць. У гэ­тым со­ку раз­вод­зяць трыц­цаць фун­таў цук­ру і да­да­юць столь­кі ва­ды, каб атры­ма­ла­ся су­месь ва­гой у во­сем­дзе­сят ча­ты­ры фун­ты. Усы­па­юць яшчэ два­нац­цаць ло­таў (1 лот роў­ны 12,8 г) сы­ро­га він­на­га ка­ме­ню і ста­вяць па­су­дзі­ну ў цяп­ле (50-60°С). Праз со­рак во­сем га­дзін, як пач­нец­ца бра­джэн­не (без драж­джэй), злі­ва­юць рас­твор у ба­ры­лы (бо­чач­кі), на­паў­ня­ючы да са­ма­га вер­ху. І ў да­лей­шым за­хоў­ва­юць іх поў­ны­мі, каб пе­на маг­ла сплы­ваць.
По­тым пераносяцъ по­суд у ха­лод­ны склеп, дзе ві­но яшчэ не­ка­то­ры час бу­дзе бра­дзіць, а пас­ля ба­ры­лы шчыль­на за­ты­ка­юць. У сту­дзе­ні ўжо льга зліць на­пой з мут­на­га асад­ку. Ка­лі на той час ві­но яшчэ за­ліш­не са­лод­кае, трэ­ба па­кі­нуць яго ў ба­ры­лах і моц­на ва­ру­шыць, каб зноў пе­ні­ла­ся. Та­ды яно зро­біц­ца па­доб­ным на шам­пан­скае.
Хто хо­ча, каб ві­но за­ста­ва­ла­ся са­лод­кім і моц­на пе­ні­ла­ся, ня­хай дасць дзе­сяць фун­таў цук­ру звыш ад­ме­ра­ных трыц­ца­ці. У су­праць­лег­лым вы­пад­ку бя­руць толь­кі двац­цаць пяць.
Ка­лі не за­ткнуць хут­ка боч­ку, ві­но не бу­дзе шы­пець, бо вуг­ля­кіс­лы газ з яго вы­да­ліц­ца. Та­му, уно­ся­чы яго ў склеп, не­аб­ход­на ха­ця б тро­хі за­крыць, а ка­лі не вы­рве шпунт, мож­на ўжо і моц­на за­біць яго.

http://newsghana.com.gh/all-the-current-ndc-executives-must-go-linus/,"The Former student leader of the?National Democratic Congress?(NDC) who took the party to court?recently, Njonolah Linus, has called?on delegates to vote massively?against all the current national and?regional executives of the party for?victory in 2016.
According to him, undemocratic?tendencies and autocratic leadership
of the party at the regional and?national levels, call for a rebranding?of the NDC.
In an interaction with journalists?in Kumasi, Njonolah Linus, who?recently made headlines for placing?an injunction on the party?s congress?and regional elections, said the??intolerant leadership styles? had?created disaffection and despondency?among NDC sympathizers.
Several regional and national?executive members of the party are?seeking re-election, but the rule of?law crusader believes they do not?deserve second chance for their ?dictatorial?behaviour? so that the fortunes?of the party would not be?affected in the upcoming general?elections.
For him, only fresh hands could?bring about the NDC rebranding?project to make the party more attractive?and appealing to all manner of?people.
?We need capable and competent?people who could make the NDC the
obvious choice for the marginalized?in the society,? Linus charged and called on the party?s delegates to?heed to his advice.
On Monday, Linus accepted an?offer from the NDC national executives
to end the legal tussle that was?centred on overstay of leaders in?office and new election guidelines?that discriminate against some members?of the party who want to contest?for various positions at the regional?level.
As part of the agreement, committees?would be set up to oversee?and supervise the conduct of the?entire election process so that it?would not be left in the hands of the?national and the regional executive?committee.
?I think it is not just my client?who won. It is victory for the entire?NDC,? lawyer for the NDC activist?said.
The party has since decided to set?up an independent body to oversee?its upcoming elections.

 All they have to do is start off the introduction with the name of 60s’ stars such as MGR, Sivaji, and Gemini and soon the shouts begin.  “
Paalum Pazhamum!” one gentleman yells repeatedly, hoping that they’ll showcase his favourite song. Another one rolls his eyes and turns to him. “
Nenjam Marapathillai is so much better,” he says, as though he is running the show. A good melody, when it clicks, is never forgotten. And no better show to prove that than
Iniyavai 60 organised by Music Lovers Chennai. It covers all the 60s’ delights. From MGR and Sivaji to comedy actor Nagesh, every star is given his due.
And the singers? From theatre to stage shows and a few films here and there, they’ve all made their mark.While Usha Raj and Krishnaraj are as sweet-sounding as P. Susheela and PBS themselves, Kovai Murali presents some TMS numbers and Jayashree’s vibrant throw is reminiscent of L.R. Eshwari’s standout vocals. Margazhi season is now running in full steam. Yet, at the intersection of multiple sabhas lies a show like
Iniyavai 60 .  Sari-clad ladies and men in their best formal shirts sit down and enjoy classic melodies, clapping their hands to the peppy Sankarabharanam and swaying to a heartening Shuddha Dhanyasi amidst a cool December breeze.

 As we reported on Monday, the ruling party has spent billions of Shillings in various schemes and initiatives that climaxed with the removal of Amama
 Mbabazi from the leadership of the National Resistance Movement. Obviously the NRM deserves space to handle its intra-party affairs the way it sees fit. But we live in a country with one dominant party that hardly tries to create boundaries between it and the government; in such a situation the lines between party and national leadership and resources easily become  dangerously blurred and of concern to all Ugandans.
 In 2015, we urge the NRM government to get its priorities right. First, we need peace, security and stability on the streets and in the villages. With election year 2016 around the corner, political contestation is bound to heighten; but a prudent government can ensure stability by respecting the rights of especially opposition politicians.
 Seeing contrived security threats in legitimate politics only provokes needless confrontation. That should also allow security to focus on real threats to peace, including armed robberies and murders.
 We also hope the NRM has learnt lessons from the last elections, when frenzied election-inspired expenditure helped to bring the economy to its knees.
 As the party in government, the NRM can show leadership by seeking to win with superior arguments, instead of fearing that it could be outspent by its rivals. Uganda has to live after the 2016 elections and let us not ruin it.
 Besides the NRM-centred political drama, news headlines have also been dominated by stories related to corruption and value for money in public procurement. Issues such as the Mukono-Katosi road and the standard gauge railway projects are being carried forward into 2015. The government must resolutely sort out the mess in procurement so that Ugandans are not short-changed.
 For a country that aspires to middle-income status, it is worrying that almost every multi-billion procurement project gets mired in scandal and controversy – with billions of taxpayers’ money and the country’s reputation at stake",Get priorities right in 2015
http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/12/delta-upus-threat-bother-nwaoboshi/,"CHIEF Peter Nwaboshi, former chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Delta State is presently one of the aspirants for the party’s ticket in the Delta North senatorial district. He is one of those, who strongly believe that Delta North should produce Governor Emmanuel Uduaghan’s successor in 2015.
He explains in this interview why and also advanced reasons why the Delta Central senatorial district should tread sensibly on the issue.
HOW is your senatorial quest going?
We are campaigning, selling our vision and programmes to the people, the PDP family and electorate. I and my organization are confident that by the grace of God I will emerge victorious at the primaries of my party, after which, we will go for the main election.
Do you consider Dr. Mrs. Marian Ali, wife of former national chairman of your party as a threat to your ambition?
Mrs. Ali is not a threat to my ambition. Any day, any time, we will go to the field and the people of Delta North will choose who will represent them. For me, I do not see her as a threat to my political ambition, not at all.
Is the Delta North’s bid for 2015 governorship still on course?
I have made myself clear on the need for equity. That is why I named my campaign organization, Equity 2015. It is a reminder to those campaigning for me, those who wish me well and those who also do not wish me well that the concept we are talking about is equity.
The Delta Central senatorial district has produced governors of the state for 10 years, the South is doing its eight years, and it is only equitable that Delta North should produce the next governor. I have said this severally, I said it as far back as 2007.
Thank God, from the struggle, we were able to produce the present governor of the state, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, who is from the South senatorial district, and until it goes round to all the three senatorial districts, I will not relent on my stand and by the grace of God, it will happen.
Are you not concerned that some aspirants from Delta North will scuttle this agenda?
There is no Delta North aspirant that does not want a Delta North candidate, there is none. I can tell you that, probably because of the publication they made with some other aspirants from Delta Central senatorial district, some people are thinking they have swayed, but I can tell you that I have spoken to almost all of them since I read the publication and there is none of them who is saying he does not want a Delta North candidate to emerge.
They are unanimous and committed to the emergence of a Delta North candidate. Yes, you can understand that in a political setting, people are looking for every means to win, but not that when the chips are down, that any Delta Northerner will vote against his district producing the next governor of the state. I can beat my chest about that.
Are you not troubled by the stand of the Urhobo Progress Union that the Delta Central (Urhobo people) will vote against your party, PDP, if it fields a Delta North candidate for the 2015 election?
I have never been troubled by that statement, I am not troubled and I will not be troubled by that statement. The political situation in this state is very clear to me. Nobody has control over voting. No senatorial district has monopoly over voting in the state and nobody tells a man, who are you. If you tell your fellow man, who you are, he will tell you who he is. We shall meet in the battle field, which is the election.
I am not troubled at all by what they have said. But let me say and I want to say, when I make statement, people say it is controversial and all that, but I will always speak my mind.
And that is that the voting in 2015 will determine the position of Delta state beyond 2015. What will happen- the voting pattern in the senatorial districts in 2015 will determine what will happen in subsequent gubernatorial elections. I want to say that no one senatorial district can produce a governor in this state and if a senatorial district feels that it has a monopoly, that only it can produce the governor, the other two senatorial districts will tell them that they do not have such monopoly. And there is nothing wrong in two senatorial districts forming a bloc.
I am making this statement because of the trend things are assuming. Not that after saying it, people will start saying Nwaoboshi has started. The Ijaw, Isoko, Itsekiri, Anioma are watching.
I believe that an organization that caters for the welfare of its people should limit itself to what it is. I have said it before, in 1999, I was the state secretary of this party ,the UPU supported Moses Kragha against the former governor James Ibori of the PDP, Ibori won.
In 2003, UPU supported Great Ogboru, PDP’s Ibori won. In 2007, they supported Ogboru yet again, Uduaghan of PDP won, in 2011, it was the same thing, they have always worked against the PDP, but I can tell you that they are good-minded people from that area, who would vote according to their conscience in the 2015 election.
The UPU certainly has some fears about a Delta North governor in 2015; do you not think it is necessary for Delta North leaders to approach the group to allay the fears of the Urhobo ethnic group?
(Cuts in) What are their fears?
Their fear mainly is that the capital of the state is in Asaba, Delta North, and so the governor should not also be from the same senatorial district?
Was Brigadier-General Samuel Ogbemudia (retd.) not the governor of the defunct Bendel state, is he not a Bini man and is the capital not Benin City? Was the current APC national chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun not the governor of Edo state, is he not a Bini man, is the capital of Edo state not in Benin City?

https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/fire-destroys-electronics-godown-in-mahipalpur/,"A fire broke out in an electric appliances godown in Mahipalpur, gutting gadgets worth thousands of rupees. The incident was reported on Friday evening from Tata Telco lane where a Tata Motors showroom is located.
Thirty-two fire tenders were rushed to the spot and the fire was brought under control within half an hour, Fire department officials said. Four loaders who were working on the second floor of the building were trapped, but people in the area helped rescue them. No casualties were reported, Fire department officials said.
“The fire started from the godown of an e-appliance store which stocks electronic appliances meant for dispatch. It seems that the cardboard in the basement caught fire from a short circuit. Since aluminium and copper wires and other inflammable substances were stocked in the godown, the fire spread. The guard of the godown saw smoke coming from the basement and raised the alarm. He informed the manager and alerted the Fire department,” a senior police officer said.
“People from adjacent showrooms came to help douse the fire and also helped four loaders out of the building. No one was injured in the incident,” a police officer said.
Police said the estimated cost of the appliances that were destroyed in the fire is yet to be ascertained.
“We have registered a case and ordered an enquiry into the matter. Prima facie, it seems that a short circuit caused the fire. But nothing has been established,” a senior police officer said.",Fire destroys electronics godown in Mahipalpur
https://mwnation.com/kondi-adamant-caf-tourney/,"Newly crowned TNM Super League champions Big Bullets’ chairperson Kondi Msungama has insisted that despite tales of doom and gloom, the People’s Team will take part in the CAF Champions League.Speaking soon after the team’s 1-0 victory over Moyale Barracks on Saturday, Msungama said they will now switch focus to preparing for the elite continental club showpiece.“Upon my election, I promised to win the league championship. Inevitably, there were bricks thrown at me, with some people even saying that I was completely out of touch with reality and I did not know what I was talking about.“Now, I am saying we will manage to take part in the Champions League and prophets of doom are out with their guns blazing, suggesting that it is a joke, but I will prove them wrong and will take part in the tournament,” said Msungama.Recently, the Football Association of Malawi (FAM) backtracked on its earlier stand that Bullets could not be allowed to take part in any continental tournament because they do not meet the requirements and they are not licensed.FAM has since filed an application on behalf of Bullets to participate in the 19th edition of the CAF Champions League which will start in March next year.FAM general secretary Suzgo Nyirenda said: “Although there are yet to prove that they meet all the requirements to take part in the tournament, all the same we sent the documentation because we did not want to be seen as blocking them from participating in the tournament.“Nevertheless, by December 31 CAF will determine whether their application has been accepted.The FAM GS said the crucial aspect is whether Bullets have the financial muscle to meet the demands of taking part in such an elite tournament.The fine that is imposed for pulling out before the draw is $10 000 [about K5.15 million] and between $25 000 [about K12.8 million] and $50 000 [about K15.7 million] for pulling out when the tournament is in progress.“And when a club fails to pay the fine, it is the association that suffers the consequences like it was a couple of years back when we were taken to task for Escom United’s withdrawal. So, we only hope Bullets are aware of that and that they are financially ready,” added Nyirenda.However, Bullets GS Harold Fote said there are prospective sponsors waiting in the wings to bankroll some of the costs.“We also believe that with a sound marketing strategy, proceeds from gate-collections and TV rights, we can generate funding for the campaign. If we are able to raise K15 million in a local game against Zomba United, surely we should be able to raise double as match.“We have also lined up a number of fund-raising activities that will commence soon after the league,” said Fote.",Kondi adamant on CAF tourney

 What we forgot, was to tag the African film flag, which is taking remarkable strides in the past few years. Last year, director Roger Ross Williams’ God Loves Uganda made the shortlist; there was a lot of anticipation that since it was during that period that the anti-gay bill was signed into law, the Academy awards (Oscars) would consider and nominate the documentary.
 But it didn’t happen; they, instead, went for The Square by Egyptian filmmaker Jehane Noujaim; it was a documentary about the ongoing Arab Spring that started in 2011, from its roots in Tahrir Square. The Square walked away with the best documentary gong at the Oscars, making it the second African winner alongside Lupita Nyong’o, who won best supporting actress for her role in 12 Years A Slave.
 This year, the much- coveted Academy awards are upon us again and we had a lot of expectations this year, especially with the premiere of films such as Veve from Kenya, October 1 from Nigeria and Timbuktu (Mauritius/Mali). However, only Timbuktu made it to the list of Oscar nominees that were announced last Thursday.
 As always, it is in the Best Foreign Language category – this is where many African films eat big. Mauritian filmmaker, Abderrahmane Sissako tells a story of Kidane and his family, that live close to Timbuktu, a town in Mali. Now ruled by religious fundamentalists, Timbuktu’s people suffer, powerless from the regime of terror imposed by the jihadists.
 Music, laughter, cigarettes and even football have been banned. The women have become shadows but resist with dignity. Everyday, the new improvised courts issue tragic and absurd sentences. In the past, a number of African films like Totsi, Nowhere In Africa and Yesterday, among others, have got nominated.
 Timbuktu will face competition from Ida (Poland) Tangerines (Estonia) Wild Tales (Argentina) and Leviathan (Russia). In 2014, Timbuktu won a number of awards including Best Feature Film at the Durban International Film festival, Best Director at the Chicago International Film festival and the François Chalais award at the Cannes Film Festival.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/realestate/in-a-fix-over-fitouts/story-gVw8j28nUTw1UK2AYI4uAL.html,"Akash Gupta (name changed) was desperate. After a wait of five years for the delivery of his apartment, he had threatened to drag his developer to court and had been offered an option that he thought was too tempting to resist. The developer cited recession as the reason why he had no funds available to complete some towers of the project and get a completion certificate or even a partial completion from the development authority. When told that Gupta was finding it difficult to pay his EMIs and rent, the developer said he had a solution. Gupta was advised to give an undertaking that he would take internal possession of his apartment for getting some internal fitting work done. He was also made to commit that in case of any mishaps in the under-construction project, the developer would not be liable for it.
Gupta took up the offer. ‘’I didn’t want to go in for legal action as I did not have the money or the time for it. I had to take possession under the conditions laid down by the developer. Now the problem is that in the whole township, out of 200 towers, just a handful of people have taken possession without access to any facilities.”
Gupta’s building block is surrounded by towers with ongoing construction work, because of which severe air pollution and safety and security of the residents have become major issues. Common areas, too, aren’t ready and waterlogging has led to huge problems of mosquitoes and a foul stench. ‘’My children can’t go out to play in the open as the under-construction towers pose a serious threat to their safety. Even a small brick can prove fatal, so the children are confined indoors. People who have taken up the developer’s offer feel helpless as they have no option available,’’ says Gupta.
Gupta’s project is not an isolated case. Many homebuyers who have moved into underconstruction projects say their developers have forced them to sign documents with clauses absolving them (developers) of their responsibilities in case of damage or injuries.
Says a Noida-based real estate developer on condition of anonymity, “There are two main issues why we have to give possession in the name of fitouts. Due to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order, the Noida Development Authority cannot issue completion certificates to any real estate project which falls in the 10 km radius of the Okhla Bird Sanctuary. In the absence of a completion certificate, no developer can legally give possession. This is a genuine problem with some developers who have completed their projects but are unable to offer possession.”
The developer adds that the NGT order has come as a boon in disguise for many real estate developers with delayed projects as by citing it they are able to wash their hands of their responsibilities. “When pressurised by homebuyers, developers offer possession just for fitouts in under-construction towers which could pose a serious risk to residents because of falling debris, naked wires etc,’’ he adds.
Possession just for fitouts is being offered in Gurgaon, Faridabad and other real estate destinations because developers who fail to comply with building byelaws know that they will not get completion certificates. “It’s a common practice in many upcoming sectors in Gurgaon. We have complained often to the department of town and country planning but nothing has happened yet by way of redressal,” says MK Gupta, a homebuyer in Gurgaon.
HT Estates had highlighted a similar issue sometime back in which a developer in Noida was offering possession in a similar fashion because he was unable to pay lease rent to the Noida Authority. Soon after the story broke, the authority took action against the builder.
“Earlier, when the developers were unable to pay the lease rent, the authority refused to grant them a completion certificate and the developer used to take the fitout route to give possession. Now the same thing is happening due to several other reasons. Be it the NGT order or delay in construction, when the developer realises that he is not able to give possession on time, he compels the homebuyers to take possession in the name of fitouts,” says Jasbir Singh Mallik, a Supreme Court lawyer.

Fugitive tycoon Thong Sarath’s parents have been remanded into custody once more after they were detained for allegedly violating the conditions of their bail.
Thong Chamroeun and Keo Sary were arrested at about 10pm on Sunday in Prey Veng province’s Peam Ror district while they were apparently travelling in an ambulance to Vietnam for medical treatment, police said.
Prosecutor Va Sakada said the couple was sent to Prey Sar prison after they were questioned by police yesterday morning.
“They have violated the obligations that the judge ordered them to be bound to as part of the conditions of their bail. They have not complied with their bail,” she said.
Judge Ly Sok Leng declined to comment yesterday, but court documents show he ordered the detention of the couple yesterday and for the director of Prey Sar prison to accommodate them following the court hearing.
Chamroeun and Sary were arrested in early December during a manhunt aimed at capturing their son Thong Sarath, owner of the Borey 999 development project, who has since been charged with masterminding the murder of Shimmex Group owner Ung Meng Cheu on November 22. Sarath remains at large.
Leaving the courtroom yesterday afternoon, Chamroeun and Sary declined to comment on the alleged violation.
Sarath’s parents were released on bail on February 7 after complaining of ill health. Their release came after the Court of Appeal had rejected their bail request on January 20.
A day after the couple’s bail request was denied, police seized three AK-47 assault rifles, a pistol and ammunition in raids on properties owned by Chamroeun and Sary.
Van Sotheara, an employee of the family’s Borey 999 company, said that Chamroeun suffered from heart disease, liver disease and hypertension, for which he regularly travelled to Vietnam for treatment.
“He had these types of disease for a long time and he has his own doctor in Vietnam. He has gone to have a check-up very often, even before he was accused [of a crime],” Sotheara said, speaking outside the court yesterday.
Sy Satya, a lawyer representing the defence, claimed that although his clients had intended to travel to Vietnam for medical treatment, they had decided to return to Phnom Penh after a family member said a treatment room was available at Calmette Hospital.
“When they were arrested, they were coming back, because their relatives told them that they could be treated as well at Calmette Hospital,” he said.
“In Chamroeun’s condition, if the court continues to keep on postponing the hearing, I think he will die,” he added.
Defence lawyer Morn Keosovin said that the family’s legal team was preparing to apply to the court for permission for the couple to travel to Vietnam for medical treatment.
“We did not know that they tried to go to Vietnam [on Sunday]. We just found out at 10pm last night. We will examine the proposed bail again and ask if they can go for treatment in Vietnam,” Keosovin said.
Five of Sarath’s bodyguards have been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement in the public murder of Meng Cheu. Chhun Chetra, 35, was arrested on February 11 and charged as an accomplice. He joined Seang Veasna, 44, the alleged gunman; Ly Sao, 43, the alleged getaway driver; Meas Sambath, 27, and Kouy Chanthol, 29, both of whom allegedly tailed Meng Cheu’s car before the shooting.",Alleged bail jump foiled
https://www.wsj.com/articles/gunmen-seize-30-people-from-bus-in-afghanistan-1424776738?mod=%3C%25mst.param%28LINKMODPREFIX%29,"KABUL—Gunmen in Afghanistan seized at least 30 people from a bus bound for Kabul, singling out ethnic Hazara passengers and government employees for abduction, officials said.
Assadullah Insafi, deputy police chief of central Ghazni province, said masked men stopped a bus on the highway linking Kabul to the southern city of Kandahar in the Shajoy district of southern Zabul province and abducted 30 ethnic Hazara passengers on Monday.
Mr. Insafi said the other passengers were allowed to continue on to Kabul. Zabul Gov. Ashraf Nasiri said most of the abducted passengers were Shiite Muslims, most of whom had recently returned from a trip to Shiite-majority Iran, but included other ethnicities. Two of them were government employees, he added.
“The enemies of the Afghan people are behind the abductions,” Gov. Nasiri said. “We will try our best to rescue them all.”
Ezzatullah, a passenger originally from southern Uruzgan province, said he was on the bus when it was stopped by gunmen wearing Afghan National Army uniforms.
“They took out all the passengers and separated the women,” he said. “Then they lined us up and asked if we were Sunni or Shiite.”
Mr. Ezzatullah, a Shiite who goes by one name, said Sunnis were allowed back on the bus. The gunmen then confiscated the mobile phones of the abducted passengers and ordered them to walk into the desert, where a minibus was waiting with armed men on a motorcycle as an escort.
The gunmen packed the passengers onto the new vehicle, but Mr. Ezzatullah said he was released along with another man because the minibus was full. He later reached Kabul on another bus.
“The armed men were speaking in Dari and Pashto,” he said, referring to Afghanistan’s two most widely spoken languages.
The targeting of Shiite passengers indicates the kidnappings may have been sectarian in nature. Hazaras are overwhelmingly Shiite. But while Hazaras have faced historical discrimination, sectarian attacks have been relatively rare in Afghanistan compared with neighboring Pakistan, which has seen a wave of attacks by Sunni extremist groups against minority Shiites.
Such attacks aren’t unheard of in Afghanistan, however. Last year, gunmen in central Afghanistan stopped three minibuses carrying civilian passengers, separated 15 Shiite passengers from the group and executed them.
Taliban representatives didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The abduction comes amid concerns in Afghanistan about the potential rise in the region of Islamic State, a militant Sunni movement that brands Shiites as apostates.
Recently, local residents in the western part of Kabul received leaflets known as night letters that carried the Islamic State logo. A copy of one of the Dari-language letters viewed by The Wall Street Journal describes Shiites as blasphemers and calls for the destruction of shrines the group deems un-Islamic.

Second-placed AS Kigali will be looking to recover from last Saturday’s 2-0 defeat to Marines when they host Police FC in the National Football League on Sunday at Kigali Regional Stadium, starting at 3:30pm.
Last weekend, the City of Kigali-sponsored AS Kigali played without four of their key players who were on suspension.
However, according to head coach Eric Nshimiyimana, the return of Muhamoud Kabura, Jean Pierre Akili, Justin Mico and Emmuel Uwimana will be a major boost for his team against fourth-placed Police FC, coached by former AS Kigali tactician, Andre Cassa Mbungo.
“We have an important fixture against Police and that’s our focus now. This clash is always tough, Police are a strong team with good players and coach, but we will be out to avoid mistakes that can lead to a second consecutive loss,” Nshimiyimana told Saturday Sport.
He also noted that AS Kigali needs the three points in order to keep pressure on table leaders APR, who are 7 points clear on top.
On the other hand, the Police coach will be looking for a first win against his former club since his arrival at police FC last July.
Since November 2013, Police have not won against AS Kigali. The later have dominated their previous encounters with two wins and two draws in their last four meetings including the 1-0 victory last December in the Ombudsman Cup final.
Elsewhere, fifth-placed Gicumbi host bottom side Isonga FC in Gicumbi. A win for the Northern Province-based side, coupled with defeat or a draw for Police, will see Emmanuel Ruremesha’s side move into the top four. The two teams are tied on 24 points but the law enforcers’ side has played two games less.
Nyamirambo-based SC Kiyovu will entertain on-form Amagaju FC at Mumena stadium, Espoir FC will be up against Musanze FC in Rusizi while last year’s second division champions, Sunrise FC will play at home against Mukura VC in Rwamagana.
Rubavu-based Etincelles and Marines FC have a weekend off due to absence of APR and Rayon Sports who play in African competitions.
Rayon Sports face Panthere du Nde of Cameroon this afternoon in Douala, Cameroun in Caf Confederation Cup while 14-time league champions APR take on Liga Muçulmana of Mozambique on Sunday in the Caf Champions League preliminary round, first leg.

 Indeed, apparently due to parlous state of the economy and decaying infrastructure, human capital migration has continued to retard the development of the country as most of these people migrate to other countries in search of jobs that have become elusive in Nigeria.
 Obviously, this phenomenon cannot go unchecked if the trend must be reversed, hence the decision of the country to key into the global debate on the impact and linkages between migration and development.
 The Nigerian Annual National Migration Dialogue was conceived as a strategy for mainstreaming migration into the post 2015 development agenda. The initiative is a derivation of the draft national migration policy document which drew inspirations from the UN High level dialogue [HLD] and the Global Forum on Migration and Development [GFMD] as well as the Migration Dialogue in West Africa [MIDWA] at the sub regional level.
 The Project is being funded by the Global Programme on Migration and Development [GPMD] of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation [SCDC], a governmental agency of the Swiss government within the framework of the Migration Partnership between Nigeria and Switzerland aimed at strengthening the cooperation between the two countries in the specific area of migration and development.
 Within the framework of this successful migration partnership, Switzerland is thus supporting Nigeria, through the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons as the coordinating agency for migration and development issues in Nigeria to ensure cohesion in the implementation of the draft National Migration Policy [NCFRMI].
 In a keynote address to the maiden National migration dialogue, the Minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki, said, ‘’The justification for why we are gathered here today could be traced to an incident in April, 2014.  We were perplexed by a report that some countries no longer recognize Nigeria as an English speaking country and that, this was based on a survey they had conducted. So by implication, a Nigerian Student would have to be subjected to an English test [TOFEL], to qualify for a student visa, while some non-commonwealth countries were not subjected to such discriminating conditions’’
 He said this kind of dialogue has aroused the consciousness of many Nigerians who spoke against such a discriminatory policy and a counter- measure was taken to that effect.
 The Minister stated further : ‘’ our gathering here to have a conversation on our peculiar migration experience is not in vain.  We must all sit together from time to time to interrogate what our migration experiences are;, measures and strategies to harness the undeniable potentials of migration to our national development and advocacy for addressing the inequalities that exist in the global migration landscape’’.
 In the Minister’s opinion, every country has the desire to better protect its citizens living abroad as well as securing the rights of guests living among its population. Each country is sensitized on the need to establish effective dialogue such as this on migration issues, preferably with the country of residence of its citizens, the countries of origin of the foreigners living within its territories with the migration communities in Nigeria and Nigerian migrants all over the world, as they are the real agents of change.
 President Goodluck Jonathan, in a special address to the occasion, also said: ‘’This initiatives is significant in two ways,; First, Nigeria is joining the global community to mark the International day of migrations. Second, this is the maiden annual national migration dialogue aimed at providing a platform for debating the impact and linkages between migration and development and thereby shaping our national migration orientation’’,
 The President stated that what this implies is that , in the end, ‘’We would have announced to the world about Nigeria’s readiness and commitment to take practical steps in mainstreaming migration in the post 2015 UN development agenda.
 Represented at the occasion by Vice-President Namadi Sambo, Jonathan said: ‘’This is instructive to the extent that migration is a strategy for social reconfiguration, population dynamics and poverty reduction.  Migration is increasingly coming into sharp focus on the global agenda and is recognized as a powerful vehicle for boosting development in both countries of origin and destination’’.
 Jonathan explained that his government was concerned about ensuring that as a people, Nigeria should become more assertive in demanding that her brothers and sisters living outside the borders of the country are treated with dignity. ‘’As a nation, we must always look for ways to ensure that respect for every citizen of Nigeria outside our country forms part of our Foreign policy.
 ‘’Nigeria is the largest recipient of remittances in sub-Sahara Africa with receipt of approximately 65 percent of officially recorded remittances into the region and 2 percent of global flows. Statistics from the Central Bank of Nigeria indicates that remittances through the banking system stood at US$5.8 billion in 2005, US$10.7 billion in 2007, US$19.2 billion in 2008, US$20.6 billion in 2012 and US$20.76 billion in 2013. This clearly indicates a growing trend in the inflow of remittances from Nigerians in diaspora.” he noted.
 According to him, while remittances are private funds used by migrants’ families to meet daily needs such as health, education and food, they are also invested in improvements to homes, the purchase of landed property and entrepreneurial activities.
 He assured that government will continually deploy strategies to encourage the willingness of Nigerians in the diaspora to invest remittances in social infrastructure, human capital development and economic activities.
 He called on participants at the dialogue to take the responsibility of sensitizing Nigerians and government at all levels to respect human rights, stressing, ‘’We must insist that in relating among ourselves as a nation, there are no Northern or Southern citizens, neither are there citizens of any particular state in the east or west, we are citizens of Nigeria, a people and a race bounded by the same history and constitution.  We must continue to insist and uphold our constitution that guarantees the rights of all Nigerian to live anywhere in Nigeria without any fear of economic, political, religious or social exclusion’’.
 He promised that the Federal Government was already taking measures to respond to the negative sides of migration. ‘’In relation to trafficking in persons, we have strengthened our anti-trafficking legislation. We are also reviewing our Immigration Act to tackle the menace of Migration Policy to provide a framework essentially for the protection of migrant workers
 ‘’The government is also aware that to ensure durable solution for the challenges of internal displacement. The root cause ab initio must be addressed. It is important to note that internal displacement is a dimension of internal migration. We are tackling the menace of insurgency and those that have been displaced by it must continually be protected’’.
 He urged the participants to seize the opportunity to interrogate the nature of the country’s national migration orientation and proffer practical recommendations that would promote common national identity and integration.
 In her opening remarks, the Federal Commissioner for Refugees, Migrants and internally displaced persons, Hadiza  Kangiwa, said that the overall objective of the dialogue was to provide a platform for debating the impact and linkages between migration and development thereby shaping the nation’s national migratory orientation. ‘’it is also aimed at providing an opportunity for reviewing the various operational challenges at the institutional level of existing legal frameworks in addressing them’’
 According to her,  some of the expectations at the dialogues includes,; established platform for experience sharing, learning and networking on migration related issues and governance in Nigeria.
 The Swiss Ambassador to Nigeria,-Dr.Has-Rudolf Hodel, promised that the dialogue will allow stakeholders from the 36 States of the federation and all key actors in the field of migration and development to meet, reflect upon, evaluate and monitor activities in the field of migration in the country adding that’’The main output of the dialogue will thus be the review of various operational challenges at the institutional level in implementing the national migration policy, this review will contribute, among others, to the evaluation of existing legal frameworks in addressing these challenges as well as the update of the National Migration Profile highlighting key areas of priorities for future government intervention’’.
 One of the recommendations was the general agreement that beginning from 2015, the dialogue will now assume a yearly event in Nigeria.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/671527/plane-carrying-chile-soccer-stars-found-50-years-on,"SANTIAGO — Climbers in Chile’s Andes say they have found the wreckage of a missing plane that disappeared more than half a century ago with a team of soccer stars on board.
Images of the twisted wreck of the LAN Chile Douglas DC-3 that went down April 3, 1961 were shown on Chilean television Sunday, released by the climbers who said the find was in Maule, about 300 kilometers (190 miles) south of Santiago.

“The plane is more than 3,200 meters (10,000 feet) up the mountain. Quite a bit of the fuselage is still there, a lot of things scattered over the area including human bones. So this story is getting a rewrite since this is not where original accounts said,” one of the mountaineers, Leonardo Albornoz, explained.
The plane was carrying 34 people when it crashed, with all presumed dead.
They included eight members of the Green Cross football squad, team coach Arnaldo Vasquez, and other team staff and friends who were coming back to Santiago from a match in Osorno.
The plane has been missing ever since, but the story until now had been that a LAN pilot had spotted something he said was the footballers’ plane in another location — near the city of Linares.
The mountaineers declined to give the exact location to Chilean media, saying they feared the crash site could be desecrated, even though it is remote.

https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/commentary/20150304/race-and-gender-bias-hurts-hotel-sector,"As a Jamaican, I respond in support of the story about the challenges facing Sam James, 'Racism at Tryall?', published in The Gleaner on Sunday, February 1, 2015. The claim that Jamaica's labour force does not have qualified professionals for executive/managerial positions in the tourism industry is simply not true. I propose that the real problem is social prejudice, including gender and racial bias, that afflicts Jamaica's tourism employers.
According to my recent research (Jamaica's Tourism Employment: The Role of Gender, Department of Geography and Environmental Management, University of Waterloo, Canada, 2013), Jamaica's tourism industry contends with the pervasive issue of social prejudice. I conclude that while there may be a scarcity of qualified males for top positions within the hotel accommodation sector, there is an abundance of qualified females. However, the problem is that foreign-owned hotels are less likely than local establishments to hire female managers.
According to information from the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (2000-2008), the majority of professional and higher-ranking positions in the national labour force were held by women (57%). However, the situation in the tourism industry is the extreme opposite. My study examined hotels in the major tourist areas. In Montego Bay, more than 90 per cent of managers were male, followed by Ocho Rios with more than 80 per cent. Hotels in Negril had the highest percentage of female managers - just over 30 per cent.
These employment figures are not in line with the ratio of male-female graduates from the University of the West Indies in the period 2000-2011. Females outnumbered males five to one in the bachelor's degree programme in tourism management; and seven to one in the master's! What are the credentials of the top-ranking males in Jamaica's tourism industry - whether local or expatriate - compared with the female employees who are reporting to them and doing most, if not all, the work?
Given the scarcity of qualified local males, it can be assumed that managerial and executive positions within Jamaica's tourism industry are filled by expatriate males. Earlier studies by Costa, published in 2012 by the Journal of Teaching in Travel & Tourism, acknowledge the inequality in tourism employment between expatriates and nationals.

negative social characteristics
It is well established in research findings published by others such Shekella (2011) and Boonabaana (2012) that the negative social characteristics of the tourism industry adversely affect the attraction and retention of quality employees and are among the reasons that tourism has not delivered on its potential benefits to islands such as Jamaica, which are so dependent on this sector.
As long as the tourism industry in Jamaica continues to privilege men for managerial and executive positions, while undervaluing and underutilising women with higher-level education and training, our competent females, with sterling academic credentials and a passion for tourism, will be forced to migrate or venture into other professions to earn a living and develop their careers.
Tourism employers, especially foreign-owned hotels, persist in claiming that they cannot find competent people of Jamaican nationality to fill management positions, so they will continue to give expatriate males the top jobs. Our people with abundant capacity - whether male or female - will rarely get the chance in Jamaica to get a foot in the door of the executive suite.

https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/commentary/20150429/toothless-defence-utech-dental-programme,"Professor Colin Gyles, in an article in yesterday's Gleaner, made some assertions on which I would like to comment and shed some light. Professor Gyles was responding to a comment by Professor Carolyn Cooper that the UTech dental programme ""hasn't even applied for accreditation"". First and foremost, Professor Cooper's statement is absolutely accurate. The accreditation status of any medical or dental teaching institution in the Caribbean can be verified by simply visiting the CAAM-HP website.
CAAM-HP is the Caribbean accreditation authority for education in medicine and other health professions. Accreditation bodies organise competent teams to evaluate curricula, facilities especially lab and clinic facilities, and importantly, the bona fides of the faculty. Professor Gyles asserts that any criticism of UTech is a criticism of a host of other institutions where ""experts received their training"". However, unless and until an accreditation authority reviews the curriculum vitae of every member of faculty, how do we know, for example, that someone who claims to be an orthodontist has actually had the required training?
an urgent need
Other important issues such as the calibre of the incoming cohort would be reviewed by any accrediting body so that someone who has the ability to pass only three CSEC subjects is not allowed into a programme just because they have the financial means. Accreditation of an institution is important not only for the public to feel confident that its graduates are well trained, but also that their degrees may be recognised by other institutions as they seek further study elsewhere. UTech's College of Oral Health Sciences needs to start this process.

Continuing, Professor Gyles states that the UTech programme is recognised by the Dental Council of Jamaica, and I am grateful to him for opening the window on this topical issue.
While the Dental Council of Jamaica has no mechanism to determine the competency of a school training dental surgeons, as our anachronistic Dental Act of 1972 did not foresee this eventuality, it would not be a surprise to me that the council ""recognised"" the UTech dental programme since four of the seven dentists on the outgoing council were on the faculty of the UTech dental programme. Included in this number is the dean of the programme, Dr Irving McKenzie, who, by virtue of his position as chief dental officer in the Ministry of Health, has an ex-officio position on the council and has sat there for more than a decade.
These offices put Dr McKenzie in the enviable position of being, at the same time, the head of a school graduating dentists and the most influential member of the council that will ""recognise"" the school and then register the same graduates to practise! The minister of health, Dr Fenton Ferguson, to my utter dismay and disappointment, sees nothing wrong with this.
Professor Gyles continues to venture where he knows not when he states that the Commission on Dental Competency Assessment (CDCA) recognises the UTech dental programme. The CDCA is an independent testing authority and a very good one, I might add. The CDCA is not an accrediting agency. The CDCA will not recognise an institution but it will recognise the state board or, in our case, the Dental Council.
new council
The CDCA does not approve dentists to practise in the United States or Canada; however, results from CDCA examinations may be tendered as one part of a dentist's requirements to become licensed by an American State Board. Canada and its provinces are a whole different situation. In most US states, one of the other requirements for licensure would be your DDS or DMD degree from an ACCREDITED university. In the USA, the accrediting authority is the American Dental Association's Council on Dental Accreditation (CODA).
Currently, Dr Ferguson is in the process of constituting a new Dental Council, the term of the old council having expired. It is the job of the council to register dentists, to police the profession, and to suggest changes to regulations that meet current needs. Under the Dental Act, it is the minister's prerogative to decide which organisations are represented on council. The minister seems set to select five members to council, including the chairman, who are likely to report to Dr McKenzie either at UTech or at the Ministry of Health. Together with Dr McKenzie, this constitutes the majority of council. Unfortunately, while others are alarmed at the lack of transparency and the appearance of bias, the minister is not only content with the situation, but has refused to listen to alternative views.
I am surprised that Dr McKenzie would allow Professor Gyles to wade into this quagmire with neither boat nor paddle.

https://thenationonlineng.net/bisi-akande/,"HE was the interim National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress at the inception. He brought his wealth of experience to bear at the teething stage of the party till it stabilised and attained the height it is today.
Born in Ila Orangun on 23 January 1939, Chief Akande was deputy governor of Oyo State between 1979 and 1983 when the late Chief Bola Ige was governor of the state under the platform of the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN).
From being a deputy governor, he rose to be elected governor of Osun State in 1999 on the platform of the defunct Alliance for Democracy (AD) when democracy returned to the country. He successfully ruled the state for four years.
He added another feather to his cap when he later emerged the factional chairman of the AD in late 2003 at a convention held in Lagos. In 2006, he was elected the chairman of the Action Congress (AC) by consensus at the party’s Kaduna convention. On December 2010, the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) conducted its National Convention in Benin City, which returned Chief Bisi Akande as the National Chairman.
When the ACN, CPC, ANPP and a faction of APGA merged in 2013 to form the APC, he subsequently became the interim chairman of the party. The process of getting the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) to register the party was greeted by daunting challenges and opposition but the Chief Akande-led team never caved in. They confronted the challenges that assailed the party from the outset head long and did not sleep or slumber until they conquered.
Chief Akande successfully organised the first National Convention of the party that ushered in the present executive members and bequeathed to the Chief John Odigie-Oyegun-led executive a strong and formidable party, which he (Akande) described then as the best alternative to the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Speaking during the inauguration of members of the party’s new national executive committee, Akande described the event as “Epoch-making”, adding: “That this day has come at all is a major achievement, because the anti-democratic forces did not give the APC a chance to survive. In fact, they did not believe that the new child called the APC would be born at all. They wobbled in the belief that Nigeria is a one-party state, using PDP as a decoy of the one party by rigging elections since 2003.
“When the leaders of our various parties came together to consummate the first merger in the history of our dear country, the enemies of progress jeered at us, deriding us as strange bed fellows who could not work together. Today, we are no longer a party of strange bedfellows. We are a truly pan-Nigerian political party that is giving our people hope.”
Even after leaving as the interim chairman, Chief Akande never hesitated in rallying support for the new executive of the party as he kept calling on the party members across the country to rally round the National Executive Council of the party in order to ensure the fortune of the party in the general election.
He severally came under severe attack in the hands of the present administration when he chided the president for not doing enough to rescue the kidnapped Chibok girls. On one occasion, Presidential spokesman, Reuben Abati, described him as one of those who run down the country and creating problem for it. But all that did not cow him, rather, it emboldened him the more to speak the truth to those in power.
With the victory of Gen Muhammadu Buhari at the March 28, presidential election, it is unarguable that Chief Akande’s heart is filled with joy. He can today look back at his struggles, pains and labour in nurturing the party to the state of a ruling party in the waiting and rejoice that all that is not in vain.",Bisi Akande The Nation Newspaper

http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20150511/grandparents-cannot-cope-frustrated-guardians-barrel-children-want,"The Child Development Agency (CDA) has been flooded in recent times with calls from grandparents of 'barrel children' who are pleading for the State to remove them from their care.
""Right now, there is a new phenomenon, because all the grandparents are now calling the CDA to say, 'Look, we can't manage them, come and take them from us, because our children left them with us and we just can't manage anymore'."" Minister of Youth and Culture Lisa Hanna revealed as she addressed journalists at a Gleaner Editors' Forum held last Friday at the company's Kingston offices.
'Barrel children' are children who have been left behind or abandoned by parents who have gone off to live or work in another country in order to secure a better life. These children are often left in the care of other relatives with the assurance that their parents will come back to get them as soon as they are financially able.
""Where the child has an expectation that he is going to be with the parent, you cannot imagine what the grandparents go through here,"" Hanna said.
The minister said some of these children who have been left behind usually display a high level of anger because their parents have reneged on their promise to come back for them.
Chief executive officer of the CDA, Rosalee Gage-Grey, noted that some of these children become uncontrollable, and when the grandparents are unable to cope, they call the agency.
""I remember one called last week and she said, 'If you don't come, I am going to kill him, because I am done',"" Gage-Grey said.
""What they are doing now is to say, 'Take them, I am not going to go to prison for them',"" she added.
The law currently allows for parents who cannot manage their children to turn them over to the State.
""Daily, we have to be talking down parents to say, 'Give them another chance, let us work with you',"" said Gage-Grey, who believes it is important that biological parents maintain a bond with their children.
The CDA tries to divert children from state care with the help of it's Children and Family Support Unit, which was established to strengthen the capacity of families to care for vulnerable children.
Counseling is generally done with parents and children, and efforts are made to address other issues affecting the family structure.",Grandparents cannot cope - Frustrated guardians of 'barrel children' want to hand over responsibility to CDA

https://thesun.my/archive/1430081-GSARCH311282,"PETALING JAYA: THE Transport Ministry will urge the police and Road Transport Department to strengthen enforcement against rear-seat passengers who do not buckle up.
The latest statistics showed that only 7-9% of rear-seat passengers fasten their seatbelt, Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai told Sin Chew Daily in an interview published today.
This figure is worrying, he said, adding that despite the enforcement, many people do not buckle up, which is an offence that is compoundable for RM300 under the Road Transport Act 1987.
He said he will request the RTD and police to work together to raise public awareness on seatbelt laws and enhance enforcement.
Pointing out the high rate of road accident fatalities in Malaysia, with an average of 7,000 motorists dying on the road each year, Liow said the government has to raise public awareness on road safety.
Enhancing the enforcement of traffic laws is to reduce the number of road accident fatalities and not meant to make it difficult for motorists, he said.
He said his top priority is the enforcement of rear seat belt, followed by child safety seats.
The government amended the Road Transport Act 1987 in 2008 to make it mandatory for rear-seat passengers to wear seatbelts.
The new rule came into force Jan 1, 2009 but it was not enforced until three years later to allow old vehicles without rear seatbelts to install them.
On the likelihood of making child safety seat compulsory, Liow said he agreed with the proponents that it will increase the safety of the child but has to take the social impact given that child seats are not cheap.
""We are studying other countries' child safety seat laws and are awaiting the latest report by Miros ( Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research), including the social impact of making child seats mandatory.""",Move to enforce seatbelt laws

https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/across-south-east-asia-in-top-gear/article7161859.ece," What do you get when you bring a photographer, a filmmaker, a writer and a musician together, who are travelling to Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand in 30 days on three motorcycles and a utility vehicle? The answer certainly seems like the fourth instalment of 
The Hangover , but thankfully isn’t. 
The four friends, Ravikiran Vissa, Nishanth Pio, Arjun Kamath and Tapass Naresh, who have known each other for more than a decade, plan to document their experiences of the people, culture and lifestyle of the countries they travel to through photos, music, a movie and a travelogue under a venture called Send it Sideways. And they plan to finance the trip through crowdfunding: Team Send it requires $14,500 for equipment, air travel, visa, lodging, fuel, post-production and more. “Tapass and I were in Havelock when we realised that we had little money and time but wanted to travel more. We joked about how other people should fund our travel,” laughs Ravikiran. Nishanth adds, “All of us who have travelled always start with stories ‘This happened when I was in...’ and we wanted to recreate that.” The boys are also quite clear about what this trip stands for. “How we travel also matters and the people who’ve contributed to our venture have asked us no questions. How do you then reward people who have financially and emotionally invested in us?” says Ravikiran. That’s where the souvenirs come in, depending on how much people contribute — $10 and upwards gives you access to the music album, for $25 you can download the e-book travelogue, for $50 it’s the documentary, $100 gets you the title of an associate producer, and for $500 you can avail a customised package put together by the folks at The Postbox, which includes trinkets from the trip. “We’re careful not to abuse the money,” puts Arjun, succinctly adding that they’re backpacking everywhere. Nishanth says, “With crowdfunding, we’re answerable to people, our work and ourselves; it gives us a push to work harder.”Indiegogo, the crowdfunding platform, offers two options: an all-or-nothing campaign and a flexible funding campaign. Team Send it has chosen the latter, explains Ravikiran. “Hypothetically, if we don’t reach the target, we’ll still deliver on our promises. But where we capture our experiences might change; we might spend less number of days in a country.” The name Send it Sideways comes from the fact that Vietnam is located ‘sideways’ to us, they say in unison. Why South East Asia in particular? “The four of us felt that we’d love to travel to places where we wouldn’t be when we are 40. And we’ve seen enough of the U.S. and the U.K. on Facebook, TV and films. We’ve explored India thoroughly in the last two years; we thought it’s time we started riding outside the country,” says Ravikiran. “These countries have a lot in common with India, but we know little about them, like Laos, for example,” adds Nishanth. It took them a month to think about the feasibility of the trip and after “bouncing ideas back and forth and taking it to 20 people who gave their suggestions,” Team Send it had the answers. “It was April 10 when we put up the campaign on Indiegogo; we were a little confident, and thankfully, our friends helped us with social media,” says Arjun. The team plans to fly out of India on July 15 and reach Hanoi. “We’re buying second-hand bikes off the street in Vietnam and once we’re done with the trip, we’ll either sell them or bring them back,” says Ravikiran and adds, “This is like an Indian version of
Top Gear — anyone should be able to access and understand it.”

A-77-YEAR old man from Lupane committed suicide following a heated argument with his wife over a missing bottle of ‘holy water.’Mhlabuli Enoch Ncube of Ndimeni Village was found hanging from a tree about 700 metres away from his homestead on Wednesday. His wife, Sibonisiwe Ncube, 69, told  that a bottle containing holy water which they had acquired from a prophet popularly known as Makhezi went missing from the homestead.She said her husband responded harshly when she asked him where the bottle had gone to.Sibonisiwe said he left the homestead in a huff and failed to return home for the night.“My husband and I had a misunderstanding over a one litre bottle containing holy water which had gone missing. The next day, my neighbour told me the bad news that my husband had been found dead hanging from a tree,” she said.Sibonisiwe said he when he left home, she did not think he was angry enough to take his own life.“He wasn’t a short tempered man. I’m wondering what troubled him to this extent. I really don’t have much to say,” she said.Bigboy Mlilo, a neighbour, said Bhekilizwe Ncube, the son of the late Mhlabuli, told him that his father had not came back home on Tuesday evening.He said Bhekilizwe asked him to help him look for his father.“We searched all around and were shocked to find him hanging from a tree which is about 700 metres away from his home. The young man told me what had transpired the previous day between his parents,” said Mlilo.He said he thought there could be more to the story as he found it hard to believe a man as old as Mhlabuli could commit suicide over a missing bottle.“My neighbours are grown-ups who should have been able to resolve their problem rather than resort to this,” said Mlilo.He added: “If only he had talked to someone about what really bothered him or had left a note then it would have been better.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/psc-wants-more-power-in-constitution,"KATHMANDU: The Public Service Commission on Monday submitted a concept note to Constituent Assembly chair advocating more powers in the new constitution in order to make Nepal’s bureaucracy independent, more professional and efficient.
In the concept notes, the PSC has sought power to conduct eligibility test for recruitment and promotion of teachers and administrative staff of government schools, government universities and corporations where the government holds more than 50 per cent shares.
In the federal set-up, the constitutional body seeks to act as a guardian body vis-a-vis provincial PSCs particularly in matters of principles. “We want to have the power to warn and suggest the provincial PSCs,” Chairman of PSC Umesh Prasad Mainali told THT. He said in democracy there should be strong bureaucracy to ensure effective delivery of service.
In the concept note, the PSC says it should have the power to override any agency that defies its instructions.
“Unless we have power to override other agencies that violate our major suggestions, we cannot introduce required change,” Mainali said.
The constitutional body also wants to have a separate mention about Public Service in the constitution whereby a pool of senior executives could be created who could serve both in the central and provincial government. “If we can have such a pool of joint secretaries and secretaries both the centre and states will benefit from their expertise,” Mainali said and added that the transfer of higher level government employees from centre to province and vice-versa will enhance their understanding and would also create loyalty for both the governments.
In the concept note, the PSC has also advocated for a separate accountability law. “Accountability law would end confusion in the event of two government offices issuing contradictory instructions to a subordinate office. Accountability law can serve guidelines to the government offices and employees who they should be loyal to,” Mainali said, adding, “The government employees are loyal to their immediate boss and their primary accountability is to the public.”

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-racing-prix-forceindia-idUSKBN0OM0KX20150606,"MONTREAL (Reuters) - Force India will test their heavily revised Formula One car in Austria this month with a race debut scheduled for Silverstone in July, deputy team principal Bob Fernley said on Saturday.

“We passed all the crash test requirements this week,” he told Reuters at the Canadian Grand Prix. “We failed the first one, got through the second one and we’re on target to try it out at the test.
“It’s first race program will be Silverstone.”
Fernley had said last month that there was a chance of getting one car ready to race at Spielberg on June 21, with a flip of the coin to determine whether Mexican Sergio Perez or German Nico Hulkenberg drove it.
The coin will no longer be needed.
“The most important thing for us is to have two cars at Silverstone so both drivers have the same opportunity,” said Fernley, who added that both would drive it at the test in Austria that follows the grand prix.
“It’s a very significant departure (from the previous car),” he continued. “It’s the culmination of a massive program that Force India has undertaken over the winter.
“We really haven’t been able to bring any key track improvement since probably Russia last year while we’ve been going through this whole process where we’ve changed the philosophy of how we actually operate our aero department.”
Fernley said the numbers for the ‘B specification’ car at Silverstone looked promising.
“I’m very encouraged and I think the team have done a remarkable job,” he said. “More importantly, we’ve been able to stay in touch with our competitors throughout the period where we’ve been operating a slightly under-performing car.”
Mercedes-powered Force India suffered cash-flow problems before the start of the season that delayed the car build and restricted parts from suppliers.
Their current car did not make its track debut until the third and final pre-season test, two weeks before the start of the season.

http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/06/the-change-we-need/,"The change we seek must start and end with us. We always look for change from outside, that is not the way to go,” said Ify, a commuter in the Tin-Can-bound commuter vehicle. “Don’t expect President Muhammadu Buhari and his team to perform magic,” said Bola. “Ah, we expect nothing less oo. After all, they made all the promises with their eyes wide open. Nobody forced them to make promises they knew would be very difficult to fulfil; so since they have made promises, they have to fulfil them,” said Fred.
“Gbam! No long story. Nigerians are in a hurry to see results,” said Peter. “Reality check number 1! If we, as individuals refuse to change, nothing will change. So first of all, we must begin the change from ourselves. We must change our mindsets and attitudes,” said Ify. “But Buhari did it before and I believe he can do it again,” said Peter.
“Yes, he did it with an iron fist backed by decrees but this time around, we are in democracy and it is a different ball game altogether. The typical human being, especially the Nigerian variety, will only change by use of force; you know: threats, guns, whips, etc. If you intend to change him by laws, you are wasting your time. So that is why Buhari’s method worked 30 years ago as a military head of state but today, I only pray he gets all the cooperation he will need from the people to succeed, “ said Agnes.
“As I said earlier, the change you desire starts with you. If we as individuals will play by the rule and do the right things in our little corners, we will be able to get the desired result. As an individual, do you do your job diligently or you lie, cheat and cut corners? To us, those are not part of the huge monster called corruption. What time are you supposed to resume at work and at what time do you get there? You resume at 8.00am and you get there at 9.00am but sign 7.58am anyway.
Is that not part of the corruption?” asked Ify. Continuing, she said: “As the adage says, little, little drops make the mighty ocean. So if we can change in our little ways, I believe strongly that Nigeria will change.” “Do you perform your duty and expect gratification at the end without which you may refuse to do your duty the next time and hoping Nigeria will be corruption-free? You see, it’s always easy to accuse others of corruption; yet, we are doing the exact thing albeit on a smaller scale.
“So if we look at the nitty-gritty of corruption, we are all guilty so we should all repent. If individuals change, families will change and then communities will change, towns will change, states will change and ultimately, Nigeria will change,” said Agnes. “Instead of criticising Buhari, we should all join hands to help him succeed,” counselled Bola.
“See hypocrisy. So now we should be patient and support him? Did he extend such to his predecessors? No! So with the same measure he and his party measured to others, will we measure to him; so they should all get ready,” said Fred, adding: “I actually heard one of the most ardent abusers of GEJ saying we should be patient as GEJ gave him the handover notes just a few days ago so he needs time to study them.”
“Oh really? He’s been around long enough to know what is wrong with Nigeria and he should have mapped out strategies of tackling them by now, so what are we saying? “ asked Agnes.
“My own na to siddon look,” joked Peter.

Our once great league crashed in standards and everything other thing. But it is improving now. Your comment?
It is about doing the right things at the right time and getting people to the same direction. The entire stakeholders in the league, the clubs, the players, the club chairmen, the league body, the NFF are collective in the direction to change things. The position of the LMC is very clear and that is the reason the league is doing very well. We are happy that people are happy with where we are today but we are introducing many innovations to drive the league. It is a complete departure from was happening in past years and it is working and we hope to keep it that way.
Who is driving the change process in the league? Is it the LMC, clubs, players, NFF or referees?
The LMC is driving the change. We are the change agents of the league. And of course, we have managed to get all our clubs to pull in the same direction. And our sponsors are also included. So everything is coming together at the same time because the clubs can see our honesty and vision and they have keyed into it and that is why things are changing.
Is this just a stop-gap measure or has the process come to stay?
It is a carefully thought-out vision. If you look at my personoal website, since 2004, I made pubic my comments and vision on how to make the league better. And that is basically what is driving this process at the moment. It is the vision, objectives and the capacity to drive the change process that is making things work. And of course, our sponsors have helped us a lot because money is vital in football sponsorship.
We have seen you sanction referees, players, coaches, match commissioners, club chairmen. What emboldened you?
It is part of the game. Everybody has to work in the same direction. We are not doing it for personal reasons. We are not doing it because we hate anybody. Before we sanction anybody, we call the person and explain why you have to be sanctioned. That is the style. We have to explain why the rules have to be applied.
The rules are very clear. Our rules are on our website. They are in the public domain. Anybody can go and download it. We are governed by the rule of law. We at the centre have always been talking about transparency and doing things the right way, so that everything will work fine. And that is what we are demonstrating with the league.
When the Group Managing Director of Eunisell, Chika Ikenga talked about the passion his eight year old son has for Nigerian league, rather than the English Premier League and how it stimulated his interest to sponsor Sharks FC, what went through your mind?
It was heart-warming. We monitor our clubs, going to league venues to monitor the matches, know the kind of people coming and we have the visuals to support this position that things have changed. This last weekend, we saw an 80 year-old woman, with her grand children watch Shooting Stars match. Today, young girls and boys in the universities are going to the stadium to watch our matches. We get an average of five to ten thousand fans at venues.
Look at the number of fans that watched Rangers and Enyimba in Enugu. People are beginning to believe in this product. It is our own product and only Nigerians can develop this product. Nobody can do it but us. I am happy to hear a private company executive confirm it. As Chairman of the league, I know the kind of calls I receive on daily basis. People you would not think would know what is going on want to advise and get on the train. It is brilliant but we have not gotten there yet. We have a long way to go.
We have to keep improving by the day and keep sustaining where we are are. Where we are today is the minimum benchmark. Tomorrow, we set another benchmark. The next day, we set another benchmark. That is how to develop the league. The Premier League in England, the Bundesliga, the Spanish Liga are looking for ways to develop, so who are we to say that oh because things are getting a bit good now, we are happy.
Okay, we are happy, we are excited because we are seeing the results of our efforts but we have to keep sustaining this, by improving. Football is a very dynamic game. It does not stagnant. We have to latch onto that.
You are known to be a marketing person, who is suddenly driving a change process that is more of managerial. How flexible or challenging has this task been for you? And what for you is the key factor needed to get a sponsor to support teams in the league?
The sponsor has to see that he will get value for investing in the league. He has to see that the brand he will associate himself with is not a brand that will taint his products. He wants a brand that will drive his business, commercially and otherwise. Exposure can make people to come to his business. He needs a brand that will give him public sympathy.
Clubs have to, at all times, show sponsors that their product will provide those benefits to them. Once you can do these, then the sponsors are always willing to come in . Last year, Nigerian companies spent N150b on marketing communications. If our football gets it right, we will get 75% of that money.
Football industry is the biggest globally and that is what we are targeting. We have not started at all . We are aiming to see all our clubs raking in billions of naira from private investment and support. That is when we can say we are happy.
The last Super Eagles coach, Stephen Keshi gave opportunities to players in the local league. What do you want the new coach, Sunday Oliseh to do when dealing with home-based players?
Well, I expect the same thing from Oliseh. As Chairman of the LMC, I’m the Vice-President of the NFF and I’m also involved at the level of our football. I was involved in the discussion to employ Oliseh and it is the same message. In fact, this time, we expect to do it even better. That is why a coach who knows the league very well, Salisu Yusuf has been mandated as the one in charge of that process because he knows the league, having coached there for more than 12 years.
Oliseh is in charge of the team. We are even trying to raise the stakes by making the Under-23 a wholly Nigerian-based players team. The boy who scored our two goals against Congo last weekend, Junior Ajayi plays for Shooting Stars. Even the Super Eagles, when you call the strikers in the team, the first name on the lips of many is Gbolahan Salami, who plays for Warri Wolves.
We are quite excited and my vision is a day where we will see all the 11 players in the Super Eagles coming from our league and when the foreign-based will stay on the bench. That is the vision and we will get there because the players are happy to come and play here and we are putting the structures on the ground. Once we sort out the welfare issues, we will get there.
We want players who are having issues with their clubs in Europe to come down here to play and the LMC will pay them. We have done that with Sani Kaita with Enyimba and just this weekend that passed, I offered the same thing to the Under-23 players, who are playing for Samson Siasia but don’t have clubs or are still waiting to sign for clubs. I told them the league will pay them. We will even help them to get clubs in the league, so that they can add their value to their league before they can sort out their future.
For you to pay all these players means you are swimming in money?
Not. It is part of the elite players’ programme. It is not for everybody. And it is not to pay them huge money per se. We pay them something that is reasonable for them to play in the local league. Because if we have any player who is playing for the national team and playing for a club here, anywhere the team goes, fans come to the stadium and the sponsors are happy. It’s a win-win thing. It’s not about the money but about improving the brand value of the league and engaging our best players to keep doing what they love doing until such a time when they are ready to go abroad to seek greener pastures.
Last week, the NFF President, Amaju Pinnick listed you amongst the four persons who were condemned to take our football out of its current poor state. What is your disposition to this?
Of course, I support him and he knows why he said so. We are working as a group and share the same vision. Nobody knows it all. We share ideas to see how we can move forward. At this junction, he is very right to say that. In the future, things might change. If we, with all our dedication and vision cannot get it right, so where is the hope for our football? We are young men, the future of this country belongs to us, so we have to do what we have to do so that posterity will be kind to us. Our ideas, knowledge, vision and experience are good reasons for him to say that and I support him wholly.
But Nigerians fear that you people running the NFF will likely not give Sunday Oliseh the free hand to succeed as Eagles coach. Their fear stems from how Keshi was treated by you people and they feel that Oliseh won’t escape such treatment?
No, no, no no. It is unfair to say that. Did Keshi say that somebody in the NFF imposed any player on him? Or treated him badly? Knowing Keshi for who he is, if anybody had imposed any player on him, he would have shouted to the high heavens. All that is a non-starter. NFF has gone beyond that. Keshi was not treated badly.
He got the support no Nigerian coach ever got from the Maigari time till he left. We decided to hire Oliseh. We are more determined to ensure that he succeeds even than Oliseh because we are the ones who brought him. Nobody forced us to bring him. We thought his vision and our vision had a convergence somewhere, so we spoke to him and he accepted to come and work with us. We bought into his vision and he bought into ours.
And for the first time, we have a Director General in the National Sports Commission, Al Hassan Yakmut, who understands how football works and did not interfere with the process because he has been in the system for long and knows how these things work.
He did not interfere and therefore, we have no reason not to support Oliseh and ensure he succeeds because if he fails, we fail and if he succeeds, we succeed. We have more to lose if he fails with the Eagles because it is our decision to bring him and once you take a position, you have to accept the blame. People are happy with the decision to appoint Oliseh Eagles coach. Even sponsors are coming to us for the sake of Oliseh.

https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/finally-a-new-artillery-gun-for-the-army/,"Gun Carriage Factory, Jabalpur plans to supply 6 guns within 6 months, another 12 within 12 months and another 36 guns within 24 months.
A few months after clearing critical trials, the Dhanush artillery guns — also called “Desi Bofors” — have entered the production phase to meet Army’s operational gap of field howitzers. The “Make in India” defence manufacturing project took off with the receipt of Bulk Production Clearance (BPC) from the Army for 144 Dhanush guns. Sources said the Ordnance Factories Board (OFB) has already started the production of indigenously manufactured 155 mm/45 calibre artillery gun.
[related-post]
OFB had been waiting for the BPC from the army to start production after Dhanush successfully passed evaluation by the Directorate General of Quality Assurance (DGQA) and the Maintainability Evaluation Trial.
Gun Carriage Factory, Jabalpur plans to supply 6 guns within 6 months, another 12 within 12 months and another 36 guns within 24 months.
This was decided at the OFB’s General Managers’ strategic conference held last month. The decision raises questions about the Army’s plans to get all 144 guns from the OFB within three years.
Dhanush will be the first artillery gun to be acquired by the Army since the purchase of Bofors guns from Sweden in 1980s.
The current order for 144 guns is estimated to be of Rs 1,260 crore, with the Army having an option to acquire up to 414 guns based on operational performance. As per its Field Artillery Rationalisation Plan, Army needs to buy 2,820 artillery guns of various types to replace obsolete guns and equip new units.
Dhanush gun is based on the design and manufacturing technology obtained from Bofors in the 1980s. Under the original Bofors contract, India had obtained Transfer of Technology to manufacture 155mm guns after inducting 410 guns.

The ensuing Bofors corruption scandal, however, hit all such plans till those old schematics were brought out by the OFB in early 2011. OFB claims that the indigenous howitzer is better than the original Swedish gun in range, accuracy, reliability and ‘shoot-and-scoot’ capabilities. Bofors is a 155 mm/39 calibre gun whereas Dhanush is a 155 mm/45 calibre. The enhanced calibre imparts a longer firing range.
OFB is upgrading its manufacturing line for bulk production at Jabalpur Gun Carriage Factory from 2016, wherein it will be able to produce 30-35 guns every year. There are no plans for exporting Dhanush, sources in the OFB said.","Finally, a new artillery gun for the Army"

A group of Senegalese illegal immigrants, who according to authorities will be deported back to Senegal through the border with Tunisia, are held at the Alkarareem immigration centre in the east of Misrata February 26, 2015. REUTERS/Stringer
Back in his sun-baked village of Segoucoura in Senegal - a peaceful but poor West African nation - the 23-year-old says he would do it all over again.
“I say thanks be to God that I am back and didn’t die,” said Diaby, surrounded by his family. “But if I see an opportunity to go again, I will try ... I cannot just sit around with the old people.”
In total, almost 2,000 illegal migrants have perished on the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to Italy so far in 2015. Diaby’s story is typical of the complicated motivations of thousands of Senegalese who risk their lives each year.
Senegal is the sixth largest nation of origin for migrants so far this year, according to the International Migration Organization (IOM). Ahead of it are Eritrea, Somalia, Nigeria, Syria and Gambia -- countries fraught with conflict or concerns over rights abuses.
By contrast, Senegal is among Africa’s most stable democracies, with a 5 percent economic growth rate that would be the envy of many European nations.
Yet Diaby, sitting in the shade outside his family home, said he always dreamt of escape. He applied three times unsuccesfully for a visa to France.
“Ever since I was young, I wanted to go to Europe,” said Diaby, clutching papers folded neatly in a dog-eared envelope. “Here, I work but I don’t earn any money. I want to go to Europe to help the family.”
Diaby’s impoverished region of Tambacounda was home to two-thirds of the 541 Senegalese migrants repatriated from Libya by the IOM in the first four months of the year. In Segoucoura, elders say 70 to 80 young people have left since January.
While in Senegal’s capital Dakar, 500 km to the west, glossy malls and high-rise buildings are springing up, Segoucoura is a collection of mud brick buildings whose 2,000 inhabitants get by farming millet and selling a few sheep.
Two-thirds of the population of Tambacounda live in poverty, compared to less than half on average in the nation of 15 million.
While hardship is a factor driving young men to leave, so too is a quest to replicate the success of migrants who send money back home. Diaby, like many young men here, hoped to join friends and relatives in France.
The largest homes in Segoucoura are built by those who have emigrated. The only electricity is produced by the solar panels that crown the roofs of such houses, powering television sets that offer a seductive vision of life in the West.
“There are no jobs,” said Abou Badji, 35, who works with the local branch of the civil society youth organisation Y’En A Marre (We’re Fed Up). “These people think migration is their destiny.”
POOR ‘CAN’T AFFORD’ TO MIGRATE
Sory Kaba, who heads the foreign ministry department dealing with Senegal’s citizens abroad, admitted that an official unemployment rate of more than 25 percent was a contributing factor.
But like many experts, he says a history of migration, coupled with pressure to improve the lives of families back home, pushed thousands of Senegalese to emigrate.
“It’s not misery that’s driving migration because if you are really poor you can’t pay this money,” Kaba said, referring to the thousands of dollars migrants must pay to make the journey.
For many migrants, the lure of Europe is the prospect of securing a better life not just for themselves, but for their families. Many relatives encourage young men to emigrate and even finance their trip, hoping to reap the benefits.
Each year Senegalese nationals send an estimated 800 billion CFA francs ($1.37 billion) home, Kaba said. And according to the most recent World Bank data, foreign remittances accounted for over 11 percent of gross domestic product in 2011.
Mahamadou Camara has lived in France since 1993. Today, he has French residency but spends three months a year in Segoucoura visiting family, including two wives and eight children.
With the fruits of his labour, he’s built a large family home; a 4x4, another symbol of his success, is parked inside the compound’s walls. One of his sons recently joined him in France.
“It’s like this that we earn money,” Camara said, with pride.
Other migrants financed a health clinic in Segoucoura but locals said the nurses who came to work there found life so desperate that they left. The clinic’s gate now stands padlocked.
MOTHER WOULDN’T LET CHILDREN LEAVE
Julien Brachet, an expert in migration at France’s Research Institute for Development (IRD), said many young migrants simply wanted to escape the tedium and restrictions of village life, but were unwilling to admit that in public.
“When you leave, you have to have a socially acceptable reason,” he said. “Comments about self-realization are not acceptable when you talk with people in your village.”
In Segoucoura, the success stories of those who send back money from Europe are tempered by the constant reminders of the tragedies along the route.
Khady Sigmaté, a 50-year-old wearing a pink headscarf, said she had not heard from two of her sons and a nephew for a year and a half. She has no idea if they made it to Europe alive.
“I would never let my children leave now,” she said.
The Program for Support for Solidarity Initiatives for Development (PAISD) works with Senegalese migrants in France who want to invest in their home communities.
In the town of Tambacounda, Senegalese migrants in France financed a centre to train young men to repair motorcycles, one of many such projects throughout the region.
For PAISD’s Raphael Renault, these schemes encourage residents to stay: “They are less tempted, if you will, to leave the village, to say there are no opportunities here so I will leave.”
Yet for those who find themselves returned to Segoucoura, opportunities seem scarce. Nfamara Diawara, a father of three, was repatriated from Libya by the IOM recently at his own request after suffering abuse at the hands of traffickers.
Now, sitting outside Camara’s sprawling green and white compound, his options seemed stark.
“Today, I woke up,” he said. “I want to return, I have nothing here.”",Senegalese risk lives in migrant exodus despite stability at home

Governor-General of Australia Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC (Retd) said in the last months of World War Two, almost 2,500 Australian and British prisoners-of-war were forced to march over 250 kilometres in Sabah.
“This was a war we can never forget, a war we will never forget because what happened here so long ago continues to matter.
“This is why we are here today. To remember, to honour, and to pay our respects to those who sacrificed it all,” he said at the Sandakan Memorial Service at the Sandakan Memorial Park here today.
This year’s memorial service marks the 70th year of what is now known as the “Death Marches,” through which prisoners-of-war were made to walk from Sandakan to Ranau towards the end of the war.
Peter said only six of the over 2,000 men survived the war.
“Following the marches, so many futures were cut off and dreams and aspirations left unfulfilled. And of course the lives of families left behind forever. Those were cruel times.
“And the people of Sabah also suffered. Australia is forever grateful to them for the support they showed to those in captivity. These brave men and women participated in the resistance, aided those in captivity and sheltered the few who managed to escape.
“Their example of courage and humanity is a story to tell our children and we remember them just as we remember our own,” said Peter.

https://www.deccanherald.com/content/495563/relativity-einsteins-brilliant-discovery.html,"Year 2015 is the centenary year of relativity – especially general relativity. The, was put forth in two parts. The first one, Special Relativity, came out in 1905 and the second, General Relativity, in 1915.
However, relativity was not a new concept even before 1905. Even in Galileo’s time, the relativity principle saw the daylight, but Einstein’s relativity was quite distinct from that of Galileo. Einstein’s Relativity included relativity of time besides velocity. He could do this very minutely because he took into consideration transit time of light from any object to the observer, which Galileo did not.
A very simple example illustrates the relativity of time as per Einstein’s Relativity. Imagine two distinct stars – A and B – at distances which light takes two and three hours to travel from them, respectively, to the observer on the earth (light travels at a speed of 3,00,000 km per second).
If the observer looks at them through a telescope simultaneously at 10 am, do you think that he is observing their states at the same time? No. He is observing the state of A at 8 am and of B at 7 am. Though for the observer, he watches the stars simultaneously, the states of the two stars are not simultaneous really.
Einstein also stressed the fact that the speed of light in vacuum is absolute. It remains constant whichever fast moving platforms it is sent from. For example, light sent from a rocket moving at a speed of 5000 km per second, still remains the same (It was known in Galileo’s time that light travels with a definite velocity. But, it was thought to be so high that the time of transit was considered negligible).
Einstein also put forth one very important fact that no physical phenomenon for effect can travel faster than light. This means that it takes a definite time for gravitational force to be experienced between two bodies kept at a large distance from each other. This time is the time for light to travel between the two bodies. For example, if a star is born now at a distance such that it takes 12 hours for the light to reach it from here, we will experience its attraction only 12 hours after its time of creation. Similarly, electrical and magnetic forces also are time delayed.
The essence of Special Relativity is the space-time equivalence as per which any length can be expressed in terms of time to travel it. Just like the equivalence of two different currencies. So, the location of any event or any body can be specified accurately not only by its position but also by the time light takes to travel up to the body. The most important inference of Einstein is the conversion of mass into energy (E = mc2). The release of nuclear energy whether by fission or fusion is the immediate fallout of the above equation.
Phenomenon of gravity
The General Relativity phenomenon of gravitation was not taken as a distinct property of matter but of the geometry of space-time. For example, when you throw an object from the ground at an angle, the object follows a parabolic curve and falls to the ground. Similarly, while travelling in a bus, when the bus negotiates a sharp turn, you are likely to be thrown out from the seat along a curvilinear path. These two phenomena are, by and large, due to gravitation and we see a geometrical curve in them.
Einstein applied geometry of space-time to Newton’s gravity and boldly proclaimed that the force of gravity is like any other force caused by acceleration. This along with the time dimension and one more space dimension is the starting point of Einstein’s equation in general relativity.
Astrophysics and cosmology took birth and new chapters were added. Black holes and white holes were the by-product of this intellectual exploration. During the World War I itself, the supremacy of General Relativity was established by calculating drift in the path of a planet, which agreed very accurately with this observation.
Besides being a scientist, Einstein was a peace lover. During the Nazi regime, he openly canvassed for the non-cooperation of scientists with the Nazis who were about to destroy the peace of the world. He was forced to leave Europe for the United States in the 1930s due to the warmongering Nazis and join the establishment of Princeton University.
Efforts by the US in nuclear technology was started with his blessings but the classified secr-ets of the Manhattan project was kept far from him and the bom-bing of Japan was done without his knowledge. He declined when he was requested to take over as the president of the newly formed state of Israel in 1949.
When Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated, Einstein responded spontaneously (not verbatim), “Future generations would wonder whether such a man existed on earth!” Our and future generations, similarly, knowing well that spirituality of Einstein behind this thinking will marvel whether such a scientist existed on earth!

https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/choice-for-organic-food-catching-up/article7501991.ece,"Healthy, unadulterated food is not just a privilege of the rich. With growing awareness among people about the significant impact of food on health, more and more people are seeking to find out where the food comes from and how it is grown. This has given rise to a new market of organic food products.According to a recent report published by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the organic food market in India is expanding at a staggering rate of 400 per cent every year.Visakhapatnam, too, is gradually witnessing a feisty wave of support for organic products in the form of small businesses and on social networking forums. While organic food may not be mainstream, yet in the city, nevertheless, it is more affordable and accessible than before.Most city malls and hypermarkets in the city have a dedicated section of organic products. In fact, the growing awareness for organic food can be assessed in a Facebook page called Vizag Safe Healthy and Organic Food which has around 500 members who discuss health tips and benefits of organic food and also studies conducted on food practices.Popular perceptionHowever, the popular perception about organic products is that they are pricey. A Vizag-based social enterprise called Sumaja EcoWellness is aiming at not only address this issue through awareness camps, but also working in tandem with farmers’ cooperative societies across India to help them reach out to bigger markets.The firm, that recently launched its second store in the city, works with four farmers’ cooperative societies -- Sahaja Aharam Producer Company, Samarthak Producer Company, Valnadu Sustainable Agriculture Company and Titos Organic -- in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu and helps them market the organic produce in Visakhapatnam. “In a direct market, for every Rs. 100, a farmer makes a gain of just Rs 20. But in the cooperative society model, we ensure that at least Rs. 50 goes to the farmer. At the same time, our product pricing is affordable due to the direct access to farmer’s cooperatives,” said Bandaru Naresh of Sumaja EcoWellness.Worldwide research shows that organically produced foods are higher in antioxidants and other nutrients than conventional foods which have high levels of pesticides and chemicals. “In fact, study shows that 51 per cent of the food is contaminated in India with pesticide residues. In such a scenario, many are looking out for organic products,” Naresh added.Diverse productsSumaja EcoWellness is focussing on bringing diverse products including some rare ancient heritage grains like samalu (little millet), korralu (foxtail millet), value foods made with ancient rice varieties, and other healthy food such as jawar rava, khandasari sugar, jaggery powder, flax seeds and general grocery items. Sumaja EcoWellness has outlets in Seethammadhara and Gopalapatnam.

KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 25 — Malaysians have only one democratic and constitutional recourse left to show their dissatisfaction against the incumbent government and that is through participation in peaceful assemblies on the street, veteran newsman Datuk A. Kadir Jasin said today as Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy is buffeted by political and economic uncertainties.
The former News Straits Times (NST) group chief editor noted that other “conventional” options open to government dissenters previously, by wielding the power of the pen, has become constricted and added that some writers have become influenced by money and power.
“In a situation where the pen is in battle with power and money, the pen will be likely to lose. What more when the pen is coloured by power and money.
“The people are forced to use other conventional means allowed by the constitution and which are democratic like assembling peacefully to show their feelings,” Kadir said in his latest blog post today.
He added that “politicians who care about the being of the state and the people’s welfare” should be quick to act by pushing for democratic changes to the government through a vote of no-confidence in Parliament, instead of waiting for the next general elections, due only in 2018.
“Politicians who care about the being of the state and the people’s welfare should think of conventional methods which have been used by their friends in other countries like toppling the government via a vote of no confidence and forming a national unity government.
“If there is no immediate change, the people will continue to suffer waiting for the next general election which is in two to three more years to make a change in leadership,” Kadir added.
He went on to explain that the people were losing their trust in the current government over various issues including the controversies surrounding debt-riddled state-owned 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and the ongoing economic troubles brought about by the lowered ringgit against the US dollar.
“The government is desperate and suffering because of the terrible trust deficit is no longer able to handle the multiple economic issues one after the other.
Kadir noted that the ringgit has breached the “psychological” RM4 to the US dollar threshold, which was spooking both local and foreign investors into pulling out their investments from Malaysia.
He added that “the rich people are changing the ringgit into foreign currency to protect their hedging, the consumers are afraid to spend and the price of import goods have increased due to the ringgit drop”.
Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak and his government have received much criticism from the opposition and even former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad on the way the country is run.
Among the latest to call attention to the ringgit slide and its impact on the country was the Sultan of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar, who today urged the Barisan Nasional (BN) federal government to resolve the current political and economic problems hampering the country’s growth.","Peaceful rallies the only democratic, lawful way for Malaysians to show feelings towards government, says ex-NST editor"

With the growth in mobile connectivity, the spending on mobile services will grow 4 per cent to reach $ 21.4 billion in 2015, it added.According to Gartner, the spending on mobile services will be driven by data services, which is expected to grow 15 per cent to reach $ 6.5 million in 2015. Major segment of the growth will be driven by the increasing use of cellular services on data-centric devices, such as tablets and notebooks.“Mobile data provides a substantial revenue opportunity in India. Communication service providers (CSPs) will need to focus on creating new pricing, with a focus on data access, such as shared plans. They will also need to refine the services they already provide, with a focus on creating richer, more immersive and more personalized experiences, to increase their customer numbers,” said Neha Gupta, senior research analyst at Gartner.Some of the major reasons cited for the growth in data services are faster networks, a rise in the number of users and more affordable smart phones. It also said the spending on data services will be heavily driven by mobile video applications.“In the current scenario applications and content are driving traffic volumes as people increasingly chat to friends and family, watch videos on the move, and listen to streamed music,” added the report.As the mobile app market matures, app developers will have to sharpen their focus on the marketing and transparency of their apps, in order to retain customers.Gartner's research indicates that although affluent people and traditional early adopters are the leading users of new technologies and devices, younger, less wealthy people make greater use of mobile apps.

Another 47 people, including 22 women, are injured. As many as 10 of them in a critical condition. The injured are being treated at the Sialkot CMH. The government offered condolences to the grieving families and prayed for the quick recovery of the injured.
Mainly three villages Kundunpur, Bajra Garhi and Thathi were targeted in which several houses were also damaged. The Indian firing started at around 2330hrs, when Pakistani troops confronted India for using an excavator, near the Working Boundary without following the established SOPs. Pakistani troops initially exercised restraint, however, responded befittingly when India started heavy firing. The firing ended at 1100hrs.
While condemning the Indian practice of targeting civilians on purpose, the Government of Pakistan expressed its deep concern at the continued hostility at the LoC and the Working Boundary. The Indian Government was urged to stop forthwith the ceasefire violations and observe the 2003 Ceasefire Arrangement for restoration of peace and tranquility at the LoC and the Working Boundary.

https://www.nyamile.com/world/africa/breakthrough-components-of-south-sudan-compromise-peace-agreement-partially-signed/,"August 17, 2015(Nyamilepedia) — As the August 17th dateline come to pass, the leaders of South Sudan, with exception of Mr. Salva Kiir, have signed the revised IGAD-Plus Compromise Peace Agreement today in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
While Dr. Riek Machar Teny signed the agreement on behave of SPLM/SPLA, Pagan Amum signed the document on behave of the former detainees, and Salva Kiir initialized the document to signalize his commitment to append his full signature after consultations within fifteen(15) days.
While the Ugandan President, a close aid to Salva Kiir, walked out of peace talks, Mr. Kiir requested for further consultations before signing the agreement.
“They have only initialed it because they have certain observations, which they have decided to go back to their country and consult with the constituency after which, in the next 15 days, the government will come back to Addis Ababa to finalize the peace agreement,” said Amb Mesfin.
According to Chief mediator Seyoum Mesfin, despite that the signing of the agreement was “not complete”, this particular dateline is “a great day in the forward movement of the peace process in South Sudan”
The parties have substantial “reservations” over contentious issues ranging from power sharing, system of governance, demilitarization of Juba to reintegration of forces during the transitional period, however, signing the agreement was in the best interest of restoring stability in the world’s youngest nation.
While some stakeholders like mama Rebecca Nyandeng, the widow of SPLM founder Dr. John Garang, burst in tears as president Salva Kiir delays signing of the peace agreement, other members were heavily overwhelmed by the signing of representatives of all the other parties.
Power Sharing
Contrary to the original IGAD-Plus proposals, the two main factions of SPLM/SPLA under the leadership of Salva Kiir and Dr. Riek Machar Teny have traded off a share of their power ratios in each of the ten states.
While the GRSS will take the majority seats in all the ten states, SPLM/SPLA [IO] will be represented in all the states in the country.
According to the new document, SPLM-IG will control 46% of power in Jonglei, Unity and Upper Nile Stats and 85% of power in the remaining seven states of Greater Equatoria and Greater Bhar el Ghazal.
The SPLM/SPLA in Opposition, on the other hand, will control 40% of power in the three states of Greater Upper Nile [Unity, Jonglei, and Upper Nile] and 15% of power in other seven states.
This proposal leaves the SPLM/SPLA-IG in control of 53% of power at the national level, SPLM/SPLA-IO in control of its original 33% as the SPLM-Leaders [FDs] and other political parties equally share the remaining 14% of power at the national level.
The final proposal further established that the SPLM/SPLA-IO will nominate the governors of the oil rich Unity and Upper Nile states while the SPLM-IG nominates the governor of Jonglei state during the transitional period.
Composition of National Assembly:
The National Legislative Assembly, which compromises of 332 members will maintain its sitting as prior to December 2013. All the defected members of parliament, except in the case of death, will be reinstated to their positions as before December 2013. In addition the SPLM/SPLA in Opposition will appoint fifty (50) additional new members of parliament. The SPLM-FD are permitted to appoint one addition member of parliament and all the other political parties will appoint 17 additional members of parliament. Security Arrangement As proposed in the original IGAD-Plus Compromise Peace Agreement (CPA), Juba will be demilitarized during the transitional period. With exception of 265 bodyguards for Salva Kiir and 195 bodyguards for Dr. Riek Machar, the two sides will keep their armies at approximately 25 kilometers away from the capital, Juba. To guarantee security in the capital cities, foreign troops comprising of IGAD and UNMISS forces, will secure the capital(s) during the 30 months transitional period until a peaceful transfer of powers is achieved through national elections in 2018. During this period, the two sides will maintain their separate armies with Dr. Riek Machar and Salva Kiir as commander-in-chiefs of their respective armies until a full amalgamation and transformation of the army is finalized. Accountability, Reconciliation and Compensation: The revised Compromised Peace Agreement further endorses a Hybrid Court to try all perpetrators of genocides, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is also agreed that various committees will be established to oversee Reconciliation, national healing, peace and compensations of the victims of the current civil war. Other fundamental elements such as federalism will be adopted if agreed upon by the people in free and fair referendums.

https://web.archive.org/web/20210421161552/https://www.iol.co.za/news/rats-kill-pollsmoor-prisoners-1918458,"Cape Town - A massive evacuation of thousands of inmates from Pollsmoor Prison apparently began on Friday after two prisoners died and scores of others were deemed to be at high risk of exposure to an infectious disease, thanks to a rampant rodent infestation at the Tokai institution.
The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has revealed that the disease, known as leptospirosis, is carried in rat urine and has already caused the deaths of two prisoners. Its presence in Pollsmoor is blamed on inmates’ close proximity to rats.

While authorities have not specified how many inmates will be evacuated, it is understood that many of the more than 4 000 detainees are to be temporarily moved to other prisons in an operation that will involve various police, law enforcement and Correctional Services authorities.
The evacuation comes after a scathing and unrelated report by Constitutional Court Judge Edwin Cameron, which was released earlier this month. In it Judge Cameron said he was shocked at the inhumane conditions at Pollsmoor and the sickly appearance of inmates.
On Friday, Kerrigan McCarthy, head of the outbreak unit at the NICD, told Weekend Argus that two Pollsmoor inmates had died of leptospirosis. She said the problems were identified during an inspection at the jail earlier this month.

Institute members had visited at the invitation of Correctional Services. They had examined the presence of rats in the prison, and how inmates were affected.
 “There was extensive evidence of a rodent infestation in the prison. The risk of additional cases (of the disease) is great,” she said.
McCarthy said it had been recommended that Correctional Services screen inmates for the disease, clean the prison, and eliminate the rodents. She welcomed the evacuation.

Yesterday, however, Delekile Klaas, regional Correctional Services commissioner, denied that two inmates had died of leptospirosis, saying that one had.
He said the evacuation of Pollsmoor had been ordered because authorities did not want to risk the health of inmates.
Klaas said there was a two-month plan to deal with the problem, during which time the inmates would be evacuated, the facility cleaned, and the prisoners returned.

Klaas did not reveal how, to where and when the prisoners would be evacuated, saying this was confidential information.
Health Department spokesman Joe Maila said they were aware of the situation.
“People must not easily be able to throw food out the windows,” he said, which had been the case with the prisoners.

These food scraps had attracted rodents.
On Friday the ripple effect of the Pollsmoor evacuation was already apparently being experienced in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court, where police officers could be heard complaining there were delays because some suspects had been moved from Pollsmoor to prisons further away, including to Malmesbury.
But Hishaam Mohamed, development group chairman of the province’s Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster Committee, denied this.

Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union spokesman Richard Mamabolo said they were looking into the situation at Pollsmoor.
What is leptospirosis?
The National Institute for Communicable Diseases says leptospirosis is a bacterial infection carried by rodents.

Kerrigan McCarthy, head of the institute’s outbreak unit, said rodents did not suffer illness as a result of it, but excreted disease-causing organisms from their kidneys through urine.
These organisms could survive in moist areas. The institute’s website says animals, including dogs and livestock, can also carry the disease. People at risk of contracting it include vets, abattoir workers and hunters. It says humans can be infected through skin or mucus membranes, especially via abrasions, or via food contaminated by the urine of infected rodents.
The website says an infection can result in flu-like symptoms, which can escalate to liver damage and renal failure. Ten percent of cases prove fatal.

The National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Lafia upheld the election of Sen. Philip Gyunka (PDP-Nasarawa North) and Reps David Umbugadu of Akwanga/Wamba/Nasarawa-Eggon federal constituency.
The tribunal Chairman, Justice Peter Obiora, in his judgment, dismissed both petitions for lack of merit.
Obiora upheld their elections as announced by INEC and awarded them cost of N50, 000 each.
On Umbugadu’s case, Obiora said the petitioner, Mrs Mary Enwongulu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) failed to prove allegations of over voting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act.
“The tribunal holds that the petitioner failed to establish her claims. We declare that this petition lacks merit and is hereby dismissed.
“Consequently, we reaffirm the return of Mr David Umbugadu of the PDP as the duly elected member into the Nigeria’s House of Representatives representing Akwanga/Wamba/Nasarawa federal constituency,’’ Obiora said.
Samuel Okutekpa (SAN), Counsel to the respondent, hailed the judgment, saying it was a true reflection of the wishes of the electorate.
However, Counsel to the petitioner, Dr Mubarak Adekilekun, said he would consult with his client on whether or not to appeal against the judgment.
Similarly, Obiora dismissed the consolidated petition brought against Gyunka by Mr Sam Allu of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and Idris Yahuza of the APC.
Obiora said Allu failed to prove that election was not conducted at Lambuga and Arikya polling units in Nasarawa-Eggon as claimed.
He, therefore, corroborated the position of INEC that election for the contentious polling unit was nullified for over voting.
He said Yahuza of the APC could not prove allegation of malpractice during the election.
He, therefore, dismissed all the petitions for lack of merit.
Gyunka told newsmen after the judgment that he was grateful to God and promised not to relent in fighting for the good of the people.","PDP fends off APC, retains 2 seats in Nasarawa"

https://www.nation.com.pk/07-Oct-2015/kp-assembly-demands-implementation-of-apc-s-decisions-on-cpec,"PESHAWAR - The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Tuesday passed a unanimous resolution demanding of the federal government to implement the decisions taken in the All Parties Conference (APC) of May 28, 2015 regarding China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in letter and spirit.
The resolution presented by Sikandar Hayat Sherpao was also carrying the signatures of Sardar Aurangzeb Nalotha of PML-N, Syed Jaffar Shah (ANP) Mohammad Ali Shah, Saleem Khan (PPP), Zarin Gul, Manawar Khan (JUI-F), provincial ministers Imtiaz Shahid Qureshi, Habib-ur-Rehman and special assistant to CM, Abdul Monim Khan.
The resolution said that CPEC is a fortune changer project and all the people of Pakistan fully support it. However, it said change in the original route had made it controversial. The provincial assembly has already passed a resolution in this regard while a number of seminars, conferences, walks and protests have been staged outside the provincial assembly to restore the original route of the corridor.
It said that on May 28, 2015 an All Parties Conference (APC) was held in Islamabad under the chair of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. “The APC evolved consensus,” it said, adding the western route will be the route of corridor and will be completed first and named the cities and towns, which came on way of the western route.
Subsequently maps issued and allocations of the federal government budget have created doubts regarding the western route. According to present plans, the western route will remain the same old single road of National Highway. The budget allocations are to connect this route to Gawadar on one hand and Karakurram Highway (KKH) on the other.
The resolution said that any deviation from the decisions of the APC will not be acceptable to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Moreover, it will create disharmony among the federating units of Pakistan. In their speeches in support of the resolution, Syed Jaffar Shah of ANP, Senior Minister Inayatullah Khan and Saleem Khan of PPP also expressed concern over the deviation from the agreed route and demanded the implementation of the consensus evolved in the APC in letter and spirit.
However, parliamentary leader of PML-N, Sardar Aurangzeb Nalotha dispelled all apprehensions regarding change in the route of the project and said that the completion of CPEC will make a new Pakistan. He requested the political leadership not to make the important project controversial.
He rejected the report prepared by a local organisation and reiterated that the prime minister will implement the decisions of the APC in letter and spirit. He said the project will be completed on its original route and not a single inch change will be made in it.
Sardar Aurangzeb Nalotha said that after completion of 25 per cent of the international trade will depend on it and several industrial zones will also be established on it at different places. Later, the chair Anisa Zeb Tahirkheli presented the resolution to vote and the house adopted it unanimously.",KP Assembly demands implementation of APC’s decisions on CPEC

NAGPUR, India (Reuters) - Captain Virat Kohli said there were no demons in the pitch after his India team beat South Africa inside three days for the second time in the series to take a winning 2-0 lead in the four-match contest on Friday.
In a repeat of the opening game in Mohali, India wrapped up victory in the third test at Nagpur’s VCA Stadium with more than two days to spare after their spinners claimed all 20 South African wickets.
India opener Murali Vijay’s first-innings 40 was the highest individual score in the match but Kohli believed there was nothing wrong with a track that saw 40 wickets tumble in three days.
“It’s a challenging wicket definitely,” he told reporters after the 124-run triumph against the world’s top-ranked test side also secured his first home series win as captain.
”It’s all about application I guess, you’ve just got to take it in your stride and prepare accordingly ... no excuses.
“Throughout the series you would have five to six good balls. Other than that it’s been mental blocks or bad shots from the batsmen,” added Kohli.
India’s victory ended South Africa’s nine-year run of not losing an away series and visiting captain Hashim Amla felt the pitches played a crucial role.
“The wickets were a lot more challenging,” said Amla who added 72 for the fifth wicket with Faf du Plessis before his team were bowled out for 185.
“When I first came to India in 2008 and then in 2010 I was facing (spinners) Anil Kumble and Harbhajan (Singh). If I had to face them on a wicket like this I don’t think I would have got any runs.”
Amla has endured a poor series with the bat, scoring 90 in five innings.
Ravichandran Ashwin was the pick of the India bowlers, claiming 12 of the 20 wickets in Nagpur, and the off-spinner said Amla and du Plessis proved the pitch was far from unplayable.
“They showed that batting was not impossible,” Ashwin said after collecting the man-of-the-match award and taking his series-leading haul to 24 scalps.","No excuses please, say India after clinching series"
https://phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/orphanage-any-other-name,"The clothes of the children who live at El Sim’s Tumnup church looked old, unwashed and often torn. VICTORIA MØRCK MADSEN
An orphanage by any other name...
The Foursquare church is one of the biggest care providers for Cambodian children, but resists the ‘residential care’ label and the regulations that come with it
El Sim’s ministry is located on a large tract of marshy land at the beginning of the Tonle Sap in Kampong Chhnang, referred to locally as Tumnup Island and accessible only by boat.
There is a baptism pool by the entrance, and the yard behind it is filled with children. They swing lazily on hammocks, and the older girls rotate picking lice out from behind their friends’ ears.
Ridding an island of devils and demons
FCOP claims that 90 per cent of the island’s population have joined the Foursquare church since El Sim’s conversion 15 years ago. The church still sends youth missions to the area, to address what it described in one article as the “pockets of demonic oppression” that remain. Estimates made by local residents as to the size of the Christian population vary hugely, from between 10 per cent and 70 per cent. Among the converts, sickness – often undiagnosed and seemingly untreatable – was cited as the primary motivation. “We became Christians because we were so sick, and there was a really bad situation in the family,” said 47-year-old Yem Neang, who was baptised in the river at a time before El Sim’s ministry had a pool. “Christianity is better than Buddhism because there are lots of bad devils and spirits in Buddhism,” she said. Another family interviewed said that attending church and listening to the Bible on a portable radio had helped tame their previously tempestuous daughter, who had since become a mother. “I was so happy when I became a normal person,” said the daughter, 20-year-old Men Mailin (pictured above). “I believed in God because God could help me.” A tally of the most recent visit of Foursquare’s youth ministry in September was recorded online as 68 baptised, 17 delivered of evil spirits, and a dozen physically healed.
One building is a church. The other rooms, they say, are where they sleep. Some are bare, with folded mats pushed up against the walls. In others there are beds, but the mattresses are mangy – torn cloth with foam half exposed – and stained. One room smells strongly of urine.
To an outside observer, it would appear to be an orphanage.
But according to FCOP, the Pentecostal Christian ministry that funds this facility and are part of the US-founded Foursquare church, it is not – despite the fact that 60-odd children currently live on the premises.
Nor are the 100-odd similar properties that they operate around the country.
“We do not run orphanages,” FCOP’s website explains. “We run churches, always have, always will! And healthy churches care for the homeless.”
An administrative anomaly
The pressing need for reforms and regulation in Cambodia’s care system is a well-profiled issue. According to Oum Sophannara, director of child welfare at the Ministry of Social Affairs, Veteran and Youth Rehabilitation (MOSAVY), the government wants to reduce the number of children in orphanages by 30 per cent by 2018 – a huge task given they only employ 14 social workers, and have no idea how many centres are actually operating. A countrywide mapping project to locate them is currently under way.
But while many unmapped residential care facilities are small, one-site institutions, FCOP is a behemoth.
According to the MOSAVY, it is the country’s third-largest provider of residential care for children in Cambodia, after pagodas and state-run facilities.
Ted Olbrich, who founded the Foursquare mission in Cambodia with his Laotian wife Sue, said that he believed they surpassed even that. “I think we are bigger that [sic] them but ‘Whatever!’” he said via email, although he emphasised that he was speaking in an unofficial capacity.
But despite this, FCOP facilities are not regulated as care providers. Rather than being under the control of MOSAVY – the body tasked with regulating and inspecting residential facilities in Cambodia – FCOP are only registered in their capacity as churches under the Ministry of Cults and Religion.
Their proselytising mission is clear, on Tumnup Island in particular. On their website, El Sim’s story features prominently: a previously illiterate peasant, she converted to Christianity 15 years ago, after her infant daughter was “raised from the dead” after two days.
Through her faith, FCOP says, Tumnup has become a place where the blind see again, the deaf hear, and where terminal illness is cured by prayer. She is credited by FCOP with having “practically destroyed Satan’s realm” in the local community, and made believers of more than 90 per cent of the population.
El Sim’s ‘church home’ in Tumnup village. VICTORIA MØRCK MADSEN
In a 2010 interview organised by the Berkley Centre at Georgetown University, Olbrich, described the children who came to live at FCOP churches as “like fish falling into a pond”.
“We will never force a child to become a Christian, but we’ve never had one not choose to be one.”
But as Ministry of Cults and Religion spokesperson Seng Somony clarified yesterday, child welfare inspections were not his ministry’s concern. “Our responsibility is with religion,” he said. “Taking care of or adopting children is related to other institutions.”
For MOSAVY, the ministry tasked with this brief, relations with FCOP have been an ongoing concern.
According to Oum Sophannara, FCOP signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with MOSAVY three years ago, in which it agreed to transform its residential homes into “community care” centres – churches where children could spend time, but would not sleep.
He said he knew they have not complied.
“In practice, they’re still orphanage centres,” he said on Thursday. “You cannot sign an agreement [that] it’s community-based care, but implement it as residential care. For me, it’s illegal.”
Olbrich countered that all but two of FCOP’s facilities had been converted to community care, but did not clarify how this tallied with the continued presence of children living on site.
Sophannara said that he had just attended a meeting that same day between the government and UNICEF that had addressed the question of how to enforce standards in the country’s residential care facilities.
He said that the operations of FCOP had been discussed during the meeting, as his ministry had recently received reports from two of its regional offices raising concerns about their operations.
“[We] heard that they do not take care of children properly, the children [are] abused in the orphanage centre, [and that] they take care of children not complying with the Minimum Standards,” he said, referring to a 2008 government sub-decree that sets out a list of requirements for residential care providers.
Sophannara clarified that there had only been one reported case of abuse at a FCOP facility, which occurred in Kratie province this September when three girls were allegedly sexually assaulted by the church director’s husband while she was away on training.
The island’s population of Christians is significantly larger than elsewhere in the country. VICTORIA MØRCK MADSEN
The case was turned over to the police and the husband went on the run, with the centre reopening last month under the same management.
An unwillingness to engage
Despite the prominent role it plays in caring for the country’s children, FCOP has had a fraught relationship with organisations working in child protection in the Kingdom over the years.
In his 2010 interview with the Berkley Centre, Olbrich commented that “UNICEF would like to put us out of business,” elaborating when questioned that “they’re humanistic, anti-Christ, basically […] They’ve got this idea that it is valuing nature to value Buddhism.”
When Friends International launched its Don’t Create More Orphans campaign last year, highlighting the fact that 80 per cent of institutionalised children in the world had at least one living parent and encouraged people to donate money to family-based solutions instead, FCOP published an article online branding the campaign a “devilish lie”.
The article argued that the culture of Cambodia made fostering and community-based care impossible: “In a Karma based Buddhist culture, orphaned, abused, deformed, or abandoned children are seen as possessing ‘bad karma,’ or are ‘cursed’,” the post read.
James Sutherland, spokesperson for Friends International, told Post Weekend via email that FCOP’s stance appeared to represent a “profound misunderstanding” of the issues at stake, and perhaps an “unwillingness from [FCOP] to engage” with current reform efforts in the sector.
And MOSAVY are not alone in finding FCOP facilities hard to access.
Mia Jordanwood, a consultant who compiled the influential 2011 report With the Best Intentions: A study of attitudes towards residential care in Cambodia said that FCOP was the only institution contacted that refused to cooperate with research for the UNICEF-backed report.
“Foursquare has the reputation of being insular,” she wrote via email last week, citing Olbrich as the contact point for her inquiries.
“They are strongly evangelist, and this seems to be a substantial driver in their residential care institutions. I have spoken with people who work in their residential care institutions, and they complained about a lack of funding for basic provisions, even insufficient food.”
She wrote that she believed FCOP was not alone in “failing to provide adequate care in residential facilities”, but said that the organisation was of “particular concern” because of the scale of its operations.
When contacted by email this week, Olbrich said that Post Weekend had visited their “worst facility”.
He said that he while he was director of FCOP International, a charitable organisation registered in Colorado, the organisation existed solely to facilitate donations coming to Cambodia from the US.
He said he was now retired, and acted merely as an adviser to FCOP Cambodia, a locally run NGO. He did not provide a name or contact details for management at FCOP Cambodia, whose Facebook page directs users to FCOP International’s website.
Standards at FCOP facilities do vary. A second residential facility on Tumnup Island – a half-hour tuk-tuk ride away – is a sparse but pleasant building, home to 15 children who sleep in tidy rooms with hand-coloured bible illustrations taped to the walls.
But while El Sim’s church may be FCOP’s “worst facility”, it is still an institution operated by FCOP with little outside oversight.
Although she only has authorisation from FCOP to care for 31 of the minors living at the centre, El Sim currently houses around double that number. She provides for them partly through FCOP funding, but also by finding additional sponsors or out of her own pocket.
One of the bedrooms at El Sim’s church home, where residents said the boys slept. VICTORIA MØRCK MADSEN
One concern at El Sim’s home was the seeming lack of staff equipped to care for these 60 children.
When visited on Monday, El Sim was away on a training course in Pailin, and the man who came forward as being temporarily in charge was 20-year-old Hong Minh, an orphan who had been taken in by El Sim two years ago and who said he lived at the home in exchange for helping out around the farm.
El Sim’s husband – a staff member – was on the island, but away at the farm. Two other adults were present, a married couple who had also been taken in by El Sim because of difficult circumstances.
Olbrich contested Post Weekend’s observation that there were three adults on the premises, stating that he believed there were seven women and three men employed by FCOP on site during the visit.
He also stated that Hong Minh was an employee of MOSAVY and drew a salary for his work. When contacted yesterday to confirm Olbrich’s claim, Hong Minh said he was not aware of being employed by MOSAVY and that he received no salary.
On the question of poor living conditions at the centre, Olbrich emphasised that FCOP was “the only functional children’s service on that island”.
“Nutritionally [the children’s] diet is superior, due to the fortified rice meals they consume. They also receive regular medical and dental check-ups,” he wrote.
He stated that the room with worn mattresses was not currently in use, although it was shown to Post Weekend as one of the boys’ rooms, and had children’s possessions scattered at the end of the bed.
A difficult balance
Like everyone Post Weekend spoke to at the facility, 20-year-old Hong Minh spoke of El Sim in glowing terms. He explained that he had been sick with headaches and a swollen body before she took him in, but had got better since becoming a Christian.
“It seems like I have a new life after blessing [by El Sim],” he said, adding that, as well as praying, El Sim had helped him with money to pay for medicine from Phnom Penh. Speaking on the phone, El Sim emphasised her sacrifice.
“I adopt them like my real children, I have been so tired for many years without thinking of myself,” she said. Like Olbrich, she said that there was nobody else in the community willing to care for many of the children in her facility, or any government support networks to protect them.
Kampong Laeng’s district governor, Moan Siengly, agreed, and said that local officials would often send destitute children to stay in her care. Olbrich said that MOSAVY also complied at the provincial level with FCOP.
Post Weekend could not contact the provincial representative for comment.
Oum Sophannara strongly denied that there was compliance at any level, and said that the ministry would “never” take a child to an FCOP facility.
“Foursquare has a lot of problems,” he said. “In my purview, I want to shut down all the Foursquare centres that don’t comply with the Minimum Standards.”
He said that while he was aware of the scale of the question at hand, he thought that the time was right to address them.
“I want to talk with the director of Foursquare, in particular with Mr Olbrich,” he said. “Now I think that we can take action.”",An orphanage by any other name...

http://www.reuters.com/article/fbc-floridastate-clemson-writethru-idUSMTZEBB8H5O07T20151108,"Clemson takes charge late to win ACC Atlantic
CLEMSON, S.C. - Florida State running back Dalvin Cook dominated the day, but Clemson’s Wayne Gallman had the last laugh.
Gallman burst up the middle for a 25-yard touchdown with 2:34 remaining to seal No. 1 Clemson’s 23-13 victory against No. 16 Florida State, snapping a three-game losing streak to the Seminoles.
The victory clinched the Tigers’ first Atlantic Coast Conference Atlantic Division title since 2011 and sent them to the ACC Championship Game on Dec. 5 in Charlotte, N.C.
“The best is yet to come,” Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney said. “It’s good to be in control of our destiny, good to be in the driver’s seat. We just need to keep two hands on the wheel.”
Clemson improved to 9-0 (6-0 in ACC) and has won 12 consecutive games dating to last season, including a school-record 15 in a row at home.
The Tigers have won 18 of 19 games since an overtime loss at Florida State last season and exacted revenge for that defeat on Saturday in front of a raucous Memorial Stadium crowd of 83,099 - their largest crowd of the season.
Cook rushed for 194 yards, including a 75-yard touchdown on Florida State’s second play of the game, but was thwarted on a fourth-and-1 attempt at Clemson’s 39-yard line with 6:30 left in the game when linebacker Ben Boulware and defensive end Shaq Lawson combined for the crucial stop.
“We had to go for it,” Florida State Coach Jimbo Fisher said. “I felt very comfortable. We had a good play, but we just came up an inch short. We came here to win the game. We have one of the best running backs in America, so we gave it to him. I’d do it again.”
Clemson proceeded to drive 60 yards in seven plays, converting two third-down plays along the way, for the clinching score.
“They scored in less than 60 seconds, but for the next 59 minutes they didn’t get another touchdown,” Swinney said. “That was championship football tonight - two teams with the same goal. Everybody knew what was on the line. Now we’ve got bigger fish to fry.”
Gallman had 103 yards on 22 carries while quarterback Deshaun Watson had a career-high 107 yards rushing on 16 attempts. Watson also completed 28-of-42 passes for 297 yards and a TD.
Quarterback Everett Golson missed his second straight game for Florida State (7-2, 5-2), which started Sean Maguire - the back-up who filled in for suspended Jameis Winston last season and guided the Seminoles to a 23-17 overtime victory over Clemson in Tallahassee, Fla.
Maguire was 16 of 29 for 164 yards and an interception on Saturday, and was under duress all day.
Clemson also tightened up its defense on Cook, who had 157 yards at the half, but just 37 yards in the second 30 minutes.
“That guy’s a player,” Swinney said of Cook. “But it’s a four-quarter game, and I’m proud of the way we kept our composure.”
Watson struggled early, overthrowing receivers and completing 12 of his first 21 attempts, prompting a halftime meeting with Swinney.
“We needed to get him dialed in,” Swinney said. “This is not rocket science - your best player has got to play well. And he did in the second half.”
Watson connected with wide receiver Deon Cain for a 38-yard scoring pass early in the third quarter to give Clemson its first lead of the game, 13-10.
Florida State tied it at 13 on Roberto Aguayo’s second field goal of the game on its ensuing possession, but Clemson’s 10 unanswered fourth-quarter points were enough to clinch the division title.
Either Clemson or Florida State has won the Atlantic Division each of the past five years and six of the past seven.
“There’s some hurt in that locker room,” Fisher said. “That’s what happens when you play great teams. My hat goes off to Dabo. Those guys did a great job and have a great team. They’re having a great year, and I’m happy for those guys. Hopefully they can continue and carry the banner for the ACC.”
NOTES: Clemson TE Jordan Leggett set career highs for receptions (six) and receiving yards (101). ... Clemson PK Greg Huegel kicked three field goals and has made 15-of-17 attempts this season, including all 13 of his attempts in ACC play. ... Florida State RB Dalvin Cook has scored on his first carry of the game three times this season. ... Seminoles LB Terrance Smith, the son of the late Terry Smith - a former Clemson wide receiver - had 12 tackles.",Clemson takes charge late to win ACC Atlantic

https://dailytimes.com.pk/96956/the-promised-land/,"“I am the one who starts this ‘fish’ storm. They don’t usually fight back. Most of the time they don’t even realise what we are doing. We have interests in this region, our countries. Corporations who run have interests here. So I show up all nice and friendly, all friendly to get them a loan to buy our services, which we know they can’t afford. Then we build their power plants, water works, freeways, it doesn’t really matter. When they can’t repay us the debt we own them.”
The above extract, painstakingly compiled from the actual movie, by playing, pausing and rewinding multiple times, since the quote, for some reason, probably conspiratorial, had not yet made it to the IMDB website, is from the movie No Escape. The story line is that Owen Wilson and his family — Americans obviously — are caught in the middle of a coup in a South Asian country, which can be deemed to be Thailand, since they are the nation who banned it, and in comes Pierce Brosnan (Hammond), a retired James Bond type who protects the family and kicks rebel backsides in the process. Hollywood seems to be getting obsessed with mocking Asian nations; just last year they ridiculed North Korea and its supreme leader, Kim Jong-un, in the movie The Interview. I wonder who will be next.
Nonetheless, let us get back to the above quote, or rather speech by Hammond, which gives justification behind why Thailand or the undisclosed South Asian country is facing a coup in the first place. For starters, ‘fish’ is a substitution since the editor will not allow the actual word. “They”, who do not usually fight back and do not even realise what is being done to them, are the poor saps that comprise the common men of the nation, which is being marginalised by a corporation whose interests control their own, the latter’s countries. The rest is fairly simple and appears to be a theme copied from the book The Confessions of an Economic Hitman, a book everyone you come across seems to have heard of and claims to have read but perhaps not understood.
Unfortunately, taking loans for power plants, waterworks and freeways that a nation cannot pay back is not the only methodology for being owned. Apparently, having lots of oil reserves and access to petro dollars is not an in thing anymore, especially in a regional war in which no one is sure about which side they are on. A message on Whatsapp attempted to explain why we have wars, when everybody knows that in a war both sides lose: “Because we are ruled by an elite group of psychopaths who own the banks that control the government and media. They fund both sides of war for profit and they manufacture the consent of the public through the propaganda of the media.”
Admittedly, this could all be hogwash. But then there are certain anomalies that can be observed. Pakistan is fighting a war, which most argue is not its own for that matter. And wars cost money, which we don’t have. So, we are borrowing from foreign banks to purchase foreign manufactured weapons to fight a foreign war and, in the end, whenever it does come, win or lose, Pakistan will be left with billions of dollars of debt to repay, which we cannot. And, on top of that, we are also borrowing to build power plants and borrowing for infrastructure. The IMF projects that by the end of fiscal year 2017-2018 Pakistan’s external debt will stand at $ 74.5 billion. For the record, beginning 2008, external debt stood at $ 42.7 billion and beginning 2013 it stood at $ 63.6 billion.
There needs to be a revisiting of a programme that results in increasing debt by two billion dollars every year for five years, after privatisation and huge increase in workers’ remittance. Irrespective of whether anyone does that or not, the above hogwash now has started to look less like hogwash, right? As regards whether or not elections in Pakistan are always rigged or not, and in the case of the former how much noise is justified before it gets irritating and everybody accepts rigging as a fact of life, find your own anomalies. But we are concerned with democracies even if not focusing on rituals such as holding elections.
“In all cases, the core idea is that over time political democracies create an environment within which ‘economic democracy’ can arise in the form of powerful trade unions, social democratic parties, responsive legislatures and other equalising institutions. It follows also that in ‘transition to democracy’ egalitarian outcomes should not be expected until sufficient time has elapsed for those strong equalising institutions to develop. And they may not develop at all; in unstable democracies, those that are threatened say by coup d’état, or are hostage to external creditors,” an extract from James K Galbraith’s book, Inequality and Instability.
On the positive side, the chances of a coup d’état are minimal since everybody believes that these kinds of things are now impossible in Pakistan. But whether we are hostage to external creditors is another story altogether; an educated guess: yes we probably are. But let us be positively optimistic, as all Pakistanis indeed are. Once we have paid off our $ 74 billion debt, right after the economy is transformed by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), let us say in the next 50 years, we can start building those equalising institutions. But how long exactly is over time before economic democracy can arise? To clarify, economic democracy is when income inequality is at its lowest possible levels. So, when do we start building powerful trade unions? Perhaps immediately after we dismantle them for the privatisation programme. Where do we get social democratic parties or a responsive legislature? Perhaps as soon as someone can explain to the common Pakistani what that means in the first place. Unfortunately, Mr Galbraith remains evasive about the timeline, the key to the Tilsim.
When exactly does Pakistan, after following all these political and economic policies, get to the promised land? Predicting the future is a dangerous business, prone to errors, since things are always never the same, or constant. So let us remain jubilantly optimistic and eat chocolate cake or, on the other hand, red velvet is a better choice for some!

During the blessing of the new bikes on Tuesday at the agency’s headquarters in Makati City, MMDA Chair Emerson Carlos said the public was welcome to borrow free of charge the eco-friendly mode of transport.

“We foresee this program [will] ultimately promote a greener Metro Manila as people will be using their motor vehicles less,” Carlos added, noting that an alternative cleaner form of transportation was needed. He cited the growing number of vehicles in Metro Manila, with about 100,000 more added this year.
Launched in 2013, the bicycle-sharing program started with a kilometer-long bike lane on the northbound sidewalk of Edsa from Magallanes to Ayala Avenue in Makati City.
It then extended to other routes in the Ortigas area; to White Plains, Temple Drive and Santolan near Camp Aguinaldo then from Rajah Solayman in Manila; on Kalaw Avenue, at the corner of Museo Pambata then going to the Quirino Grandstand in Manila.
MMDA Bike-Sharing program officer in charge Jojo Cruz, however, noted that fewer people were participating in the bike-sharing program because a lot of bicycles were not running due to defects as well as wear-and-tear.
“After its launch in 2013, many people patronized the bike-sharing program, especially along Roxas Boulevard in Manila,” he said.
He also noted that they temporarily stopped the operations of the bike lanes from Magallanes to Ayala since residents in Dasmariñas Village complained that the bike racks placed on the subdivision fence were used by robbers to gain access to the area.

https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/in-distressed-vidarbha-resolution-for-suicide-free-village-brings-hope/,"Even as drought, unseasonal rain, hailstorms, crop failures and mounting debt crippled the lives of farmers across the state and the number of farmer suicides rose sharply in 2015, one village in Vidarbha’s Akola district started 2016 with a New Year resolution. Bahadura village in Akola’s Balapur taluka published a circular, signed and sealed, resolving to keep their village a ‘zero-suicide’ one, with a promise that every villager would be willing to help another farmer in distress.
“We, the villagers of Bahadura, Balapur taluka, pledge to our village deity and our families that we will never break down due to drought, crop failure or financial troubles. Committing suicide is a blot on one’s family and one’s village, and we will never let it happen. If we find any farmer, farm labourer or any other person from our village in monetary distress, we will all come together to lend him a helping hand and live with self-respect,” the villagers said in an official note bearing the stamp and signature of the village’s sarpanch and deputy sarpanch.
The resolution added that committing suicide was not a solution to their problems but the beginning of more problems. “Neither will we ever commit suicide, nor will we let our fellow villagers take their lives. Together, we resolve to make our village a suicide-free one,” said the note.
[related-post]
Bahadura, located about 27 km west of the district headquarters of Akola, has a population of 668 people as per the 2011 census, and a working population of 386 people. Agriculture is the main source of income here. Of the total working population, at least 324 people are dependent on agriculture with 120 being landowners or co-owners and 204 farmers working as farm labourers, as per the census data. While agricultural income has been steadily shrinking, there has not been a single instance of a farmer committing suicide in Bahadura until now, say villagers. However, in the Vidarbha region as a whole, comprising the districts of Amravati, Yavatmal, Wardha, Washim, Akola and Buldhana, over 3,000 farmers have chosen to end their lives since 2012, depressed and unable to meet ends any more.
“Though our village does not have a history of farmer suicides, one cannot deny that times are tough. Villagers hear of cases of farmers from neighbouring villages taking drastic steps. Every day, we get to read in the papers about the difficulties in agriculture, water scarcity and depression that farmers in the state are going through. We don’t want any villager from Bahadura to be influenced by what is happening around us, and take any drastic step, so we decided to take some precautionary steps,” said 25-year-old Deepak Ghyare, Bahadura’s deputy sarpanch who is big farmer himself.
Within days of adopting the resolution, the gram panchayat leaders organised a public meeting of farmers in the village on January 12. With the help of Yuva Rashtra, a local non-government organisation working for the welfare of farmers, they educated the villagers about the various options to maximise their income and brace the deep agrarian crisis that has gripped the state.
Vithalrao Patil, the village sarpanch, said, “We are advising farmers to start small enterprises related to farming or take up additional work such as making agarbattis (incense sticks), investing in a sewing machine and working as a tailor, making dairy products to reduce dependency on farming. I have been from house to house, meeting farmers and understanding their predicaments. I came across at least 3-4 cases where I thought the person was in despair and really needed help.”

In the meeting, leaders told the farmers that they should plan their day in such a manner that they were able to bring home about Rs 200 by the end of the day. Patil and other members of the gram panchayat also assured the villagers of help in setting up small businesses, or taking up small jobs, and asked anyone in need to flag their problems at village meetings.
“If a farmer faces trouble in getting a loan for something that he wants to start, we will help him get it by giving a personal guarantee. I have spoken to shopkeepers to give farmers raw materials for their enterprises in advance. If they fail to pay up, I will step in. We are also finding donors to help out the really poor farmers with sewing machines and goats,” said Patil, who has been Bahadura’s sarpanch for the past four years.
The gram panchayat also appealed to rich farmers of the village to come forward and bail out fellow villagers in need, if necessary. However, 30-year-old Amol Patil, who owns one of the largest farms of 27 acres in the village, said even if people wished to, no one was really in a position to help out others financially. “If you look at the situation purely from monetary point of view, everyone is facing issues. Though agriculture is our main occupation, it is not very dependable anymore and expenses are rising.”

Amol said it was good that the village leaders were not focusing on giving money to the poor farmers, and had set sight on a larger goal of giving them sustainable livelihoods.
Meanwhile, the sarpanch is now in touch with other sarpanchs of neighbouring villages to help them adopt similar resolutions and support their farmers. “We have appealed to the gram panchayats of villages, including Kawtha, Mokha, Nagad, Sagad, Hingna, and Zurad, all in Akola district, to adopt a zero-suicide resolution and conduct similar counselling sessions for farmers,” Patil said.
“A lot can change with a few steps in the right direction,” he added.","In distressed Vidarbha, resolution for suicide-free village brings hope"

http://guardian.ng/news/oil-market-holds-firm-after-12-year-lows/,"World oil prices crept higher Friday at the end of an exceptionally volatile week that saw 12-year lows on the back of oversupply and China-driven markets turmoil.
 Traders were awaiting publication of a crucial employment report in the United States for a steer on oil demand in the world’s top consumer of crude.
 Around midday in London, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in February stood at $33.95 a barrel, up 20 cents from Thursday’s closing level.
 US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February won 15 cents to $33.43.
 World stock markets recovered slightly on Friday, with most European indices staging a modest rebound after China removed trading curbs, a move that underpinned Asian equities in earlier deals.
 “Oil futures saw some demand today as there was a slight improvement in market sentiment after China’s central bank fixed the yuan mid-point more or less the same from the previous day,” said IG Markets analyst Bernard Aw.
 This week’s plunge in Chinese stocks is raising further concerns about the country’s economic growth slowdown and its impact on oil demand.
 China is the world’s second biggest economy and top energy consuming nation.
 Beijing attempted to reassure markets late Thursday by lifting a “circuit breaker” system that had led to the suspension of shares trading twice this week.
 And the central bank set the yuan’s reference rate against the dollar a little higher after eight straight days of weakening. Beijing’s decision Thursday to set the peg at a five-year low sent shudders through markets, fuelling a global rout and sending oil to 12-year lows.
 In tumultuous trade on Thursday, New York oil tanked as China’s turmoil heightened worries about the nation’s powerhouse economy.
 WTI had tumbled to $32.10 a barrel, a level last seen in December 2003. Brent meanwhile sank to $32.16, its lowest point since April 2004.
 “The trigger for the latest slide in oil prices has, of course, been worries about global demand, prompted by the concerns over China,” Capital Economics research house said in a note.
 The global oil market has suffered a calamitous start to 2016, tumbling also in response to a vast supply glut that has plagued prices in recent years.
 Oil has been hammered by persistent crude oversupply, brought about by high production levels in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and in the United States, as producers compete for market share.
 And despite initially lifting prices, a deepening diplomatic spat between key OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iran has made it less likely for the group to agree to cut output in a bid to lower prices, analysts say.

http://www.newsghana.com.gh/660-abandoned-asbestos-mines-to-be-rehabilitated-in-sa/,"Global programme and construction consultancy Turner & Townsend is providing quantity surveying expertise as part of a major programme by the South African government to close and rehabilitate some 660 abandoned asbestos mines and shafts in various regions around the country.
“So far we have worked with the SRK Consulting team on nine abandoned asbestos mine sites in the Northern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo,” says Gordon Bulmer, senior quantity surveyor of Turner & Townsend. “With three of these now closed and completed, we are currently involved on a further six mine sites, while we are preparing tenders on another three, with possible additional projects in the pipeline.
“It is a privilege to work on projects of this nature and scale, which will make a difference to the health and safety of communities and the environments surrounding the mines. Apart from the well-researched health issues of asbestosis, a chronic lung disease, some of the mines are located next to water courses which pose further environmental and health risks.”
“The projects vary in complexity, therefore a key requirement of being awarded the bid for the asbestos mines was our ability to provide the highest standard of quantity surveying expertise in a flexible and agile way. SRK Consulting’s confidence in our professionalism is testimony of our global reputation in this field.
“While each mine site is different, the quantity surveyor in this particular government rehabilitation programme plays a key role– both in terms of advance planning as well as control or containment of costs throughout the projects.”
The rehabilitation programme falls under the Department of Mineral Resources, which appointed Mintek – a global leader in minerals processing and metallurgical engineering products and services, to provide the professional project management.
SRK Consulting has taken the engineering design lead on these projects over the past three years, as a sub-contractor to Mintek, delivering the conceptual design, final design, quality control and project management. Chosen for its international track record and world-leading expertise, Turner & Townsend has been selected by SRK as one of the teams supporting the ongoing government programme.
“We are involved in these projects from the very outset when the engineer draws up the preliminary design, from the point of preparing the tender document and putting a price to it for budgeting purposes, and again to financially manage the project. This includes making monthly payment assessments, evaluating any changes in design or unexpected site conditions, through to final project completion,” says Bulmer.",660 abandoned asbestos mines to be rehabilitated in SA

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/us/eyeing-south-carolina-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders-vie-for-crucial-voters.html,"Scrambling for the support of black voters as a crucial primary in South Carolina nears, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont made appeals on Tuesday to corral their backing. Mrs. Clinton used an address in Harlem to propose $125 billion in new spending to reinvigorate poor and minority communities, and Mr. Sanders barnstormed the South, pledging to combat institutional racism and reform police departments nationwide.
With Mr. Sanders trying to cut into his rival’s long-held advantages among black voters, Mrs. Clinton, her voice growing hoarse, warned her audience, in a reference to Mr. Sanders: “You know, you can’t just show up at election time and say the right things and think that’s enough. We can’t start building relationships a few weeks before a vote.”
The black vote is likely to make up roughly half the Democratic electorate in the party’s Feb. 27 primary in South Carolina, and the two candidates highlighted similar themes in their appeals: the disproportionate economic barriers that young black men, in particular, face and the need to overhaul a criminal justice system that incarcerates young black men at high rates and to work with police forces to prevent officers from shooting black men or singling out African-Americans for arrest.

Taylor Swift’s 1989 has won the coveted album of the year award at this year’s Grammys in Los Angeles.
The singer – who is the first woman to win the award twice – also won best pop vocal album and best music video for her track Bad Blood.
Rapper Kendrick Lamar won the most prizes on the night with five awards.

British singer Ed Sheeran also won his first two Grammys for song of the year and best pop solo performance for his number one hit Thinking Out Loud.
A surprised Sheeran beat Lamar, Swift, country group Little Big Town and Wiz Khalifa to the song of the year accolade.
“We wrote [the song] on a couch in my house. Thanks to my parents who’ve flown to the Grammys every year for the last four years and every time I lose I say ‘maybe next year’,” he said as he collected the award.
“If you’d told my 11-year-old self I would receive an award from Stevie Wonder I’d be chuffed.”
Swift was equally surprised at winning the top honour. Her album, which was released in 2014, came out too late to be eligible for last year’s awards so was finally recognised at this year’s ceremony.
She gave a powerful acceptance speech saying: “As the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to young women: There are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.
“But if you focus on your work and don’t let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you’re going, you’ll look around and you’ll know it was you and the people that love you that put you there. And that will be the greatest feeling in the world.”
Lamar’s wins included best rap album for To Pimp A Butterfly; best rap song and rap performance for Alright; best rap/sung collaboration and best music video, which he shared with Swift for Bad Blood.
Alabama Shakes were triple winners. They collected best alternative music album while their song Don’t Wanna Fight won best rock song and rock performance.
The Weeknd also picked up two Grammys for best urban contemporary album and best R&B performance.
Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars won two awards for their hit Uptown Funk, including record of the year, while Meghan Trainor was named best new artist.
British rock band Muse also won best rock album for Drones, and Tony Bennett collected his 18th Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album.
Justin Bieber also won his first Grammy for his collaboration with Skrillex and Diplo, winning best dance recording for Where Are U Now.
Outside the main categories, Amy Winehouse won a posthumous Grammy thanks to Asif Kapadia’s documentary on her life, with Amy winning best music film.
Swift opened the ceremony with a rendition of her song Out of the Woods and was one of many who performed during the show, along with Lamar, Adele, Ellie Goulding, James Bay and The Weeknd.
Rihanna had also been due to perform, but pulled out at the last minute on doctor’s orders due to bronchitis.
There were also a number of acts who gave tribute performances – Lady Gaga sang a medley of David Bowie songs, Jackson Browne and The Eagles performed in honour of Glenn Frey and Stevie Wonder remembered Earth Wind and Fire’s Maurice White.
Hollywood Vampires – a supergroup made up of stars including Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and Joe Perry – also performed in tribute of Motorhead’s Lemmy.

https://dailytimes.com.pk/90185/curiosity-vs-conspiracy-theory/,"While we thought of curiosity as the cat killer and missed the train of the Renaissance, the west reckoned it to be the mother of all inventions. In just four centuries, we realised our mistake and found out that our reasons to disapprove curiosity were both myopic and bigoted. As curiosity challenged our old and established beliefs, it brought scepticism on the table and questioned the judgment of ‘the untouchables’. We never considered it as an essential instrument for our development and totally ignored it. The rationale of the west, on the other hand, to embrace curiosity was pragmatic, realistic and logical. They slowly took the faith out of their scientific pursuits; they reasoned their morality and analysed their social values. Consequently, western civilisation made tremendous progress in many aspects — education, research and intellect — of their lives and accepted to pay the price in the form of moral deterioration and the absence of religious motivation from society. On the contrary, we stood right there, untouched like a broken clock whose time never changes.
Generally, curiosity is a great virtue and a commendable characteristic. On the one hand, it can take us miles deep in the Pacific Ocean to the bottom of the Mariana Trench to look at the darkest areas of the earth and on the other, it sends us high to navigate space, encourages us to land on the moon, and urges us to discover the universe way beyond our own planet. In the form of NASA’s most sophisticated and technologically advanced Rover mission Curiosity, it also helps us to explore Mars, and look for the conditions that could have sustained life on the Red Planet.
In that respect, Curiosity represents our collective wisdom to expand our horizon beyond the boundaries of the earth, millions and millions of miles away, to seek life on other planets in order to understand our own existence in this world. Curiosity, therefore, has set a tremendously challenging task for itself that requires extraordinary scientific research, implacable intellectual commitment and unrestrained financial support. We glimpsed at its first success in1997 when a small robot weighing only 23 pounds successfully landed on Mars for the first time. After that, technology has improved considerably and NASA has sent multiple rover missions to Mars, including ‘Spirit’ and ‘Opportunity’. Its latest masterpiece is a fully equipped Rover with a sophisticated Mars Science Laboratory in it, which was launched on November 26, 2011 and plans to cover an area of almost 12 miles in the next two years. As a completely independent laboratory, it not only drills and obtains samples itself through its robotic arms, it is also able to analyse their composition for the presence of any organic compounds or biologic processes.
Under ideal circumstances, these advances should encourage everyone to further educate themselves and contribute to the collective acumen of human beings. But unfortunately, as soon as the news about these missions arrives in Pakistan, they lose their credibility. Their claims about success do not sound realistic; the picture of their achievements does not look transparent; the outcomes of their endeavours do not appear to be promising and sometimes, the whole story seems to be fake and concocted. For us, they become entirely unreliable, completely unbelievable and untrustworthy.
We believe that although the west reserves the right to investigate any planet, examine its environment, ‘waste’ their resources on research and publish it in peer-reviewed scientific journals, it does not mean that they can snatch our imaginations away from us. We have to look at the ‘other side’ of the picture too and are obliged to find out what is ‘not’ being disclosed in these so-called scientific research papers. We have to independently find their hidden agendas, their ugly, dark and contemptuous motivations and be mindful of the power of their disinformation. To fulfil that responsibility, we invariably have to search for an equally strong, yet an incredibly simple replacement for curiosity in Pakistan. Our alternative has to be inexpensive, should not require hard work, has to be mostly speculative and should be perfectly aligned with our pre-conceived ideas. In other words, we have to devise a continuous flow of fantastic stories and provide an unrealistic twist to every event to stay ‘completely’ informed. We also understand that a vacuum is created by curiosity when it kills the cat, the owner of the cat, and everything related to research, science and technology. That space has to be filled by fairytales also known as conspiracy theories, to put things in the ‘true’ perspective and to reduce the ambiguity from the ‘opaque’ reality.
Lately, these theories have become ubiquitous in our society; they cover every story, provide the necessary information and fill all the gaps. In this way, these conjectural stories have essentially replaced the need for any scientific, evidence-based investigation and have, unfortunately, become the Achilles heel for our society.

During the “Pandesal Forum” at the Kamuning Bakery on Monday, Honasan only joked about his latest ratings at two percent and admitted that he saw himself more as a good soldier than a politician.

“If you look by the numbers na sinasabi sa surveys, sa tingin ko mahihirapan na sila humabol sa two percent natin (If you look by the numbers mentioned in the surveys, I think my rivals would find it difficult to catch up with my two percent rating),” Honasan said, eliciting laughter from the audience.
Honasan was chosen by only two percent of 4,000 respondents in the latest Pulse Asia survey commissioned by ABS-CBN and conducted from April 19 to 24.
READ: Duterte still up; Roxas inches up
Honasan had consistently placed in last place, behind his opponents frontrunner Sen. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. who got 31 percent, Camarines Sur Rep. Ma. Leonor “Leni” Robredo with 26 percent, Sen. Francis “Chiz” Escudero with 18 percent, Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano with 15 percent, and Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV with three percent.
Honasan’ running mate Vice President Jejomar Binay placed third with 18 percent, surpassed by nemesis administration candidate Manuel “Mar” Roxas II, who got 20 percent, Sen. Grace Poe, who got 22 percent, and frontrunner Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, who led with 33 percent.
“The numbers do not matter to me anymore. Mission accomplished na ako rito (My mission has been accomplished), I’m not saying I’m a reluctant candidate. it’s just I’m a better soldier than a politician,” Honasan added.
He said he decided to run as the vice president of Binay as part of his duty as the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) vice president.
“That’s dishonorable to me—I’d end up resigning kung hindi ko siya samahan (if I would not run with him),” Honasan said.
Honasan decided to run as vice president of Binay after consultations with possible running mates failed to pull through. Leading the possible running mate then was Sen. Marcos, who ended up running as the vice president of Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago.

Honasan said he accepted the offer to run as Binay’s running mate to explain to the people “that under a moral leadership, change is possible.”
“We’ve proven that 30 years ago in Edsa,” said Honasan, a key player in the Feb. 1986 Edsa People Power Revolution led by the military and the people who took to the streets to bring down the dictatorship of the late Ferdinand Marcos.
Honasan was the chief security of then Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, who turned his back on Marcos to lead the uprising.
During the 1986 Edsa people power revolt, Honasan was the founder of the Reform the Armed Forces Movement, which broke away from martial rule.
Asked about the so-called “silent majority” for Roxas who had fared poorly in the surveys, Honasan said he was hoping he also has a group of supporters who were outside the radar of the opinion polls.
“Baka hindi pa naririnig yung silent majority, na baka tulungan ako ng kaunti (Perhaps the silent majority have not yet been heard, they could help me a little). So it does not worry me. Of course who does not want to win? Sino bang hindi malulungkot kung matatalo ka (Who wouldn’t get sad when he loses)?” Honasan said.
“But to me, the more important job is for the candidates to explain the platform,” he added.
Besides his role in the peaceful 1986 Edsa revolt, Honasan also led a series of failed coup attempts against the administration of then President Corazon “Cory” Aquino starting in 1987. Honasan planned the deadliest coup attempt in Dec. 1989 when soldiers tried to attack Malacañang.

In 2006, Honasan was captured after nine months of hiding when he was ordered arrested for rebellion for being the alleged ringleader of the July 27, 2003 Oakwood mutiny.
Honasan was also a respondent for rebellion charges over a foiled coup attempt against the Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo administration in February 2006, which prompted her to declare a national state of emergency.
The coup charges were dismissed in 2007, a few months after Honasan won as senator in the May midterm elections.
Honasan first became a senator in 1995, and was reelected in 2001 and again in 2007. RAM/rga

https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/mandera/cholera-outbreak-kills-five-in-mandera-320-others-infected-1195880,"Five people have died after a cholera outbreak in Mandera County while 320 others have been infected.
Health executive Ahmed Sheikh linked the outbreak to poor hygiene and the ongoing heavy rains.
“We have noticed symptoms of cholera which is a normal infection and as we continue treating the patients they are getting better as we are giving them antibiotics and lots of fluids,” he said.
Thirty patients are currently receiving treatment at Mandera County Referral Hospital’s special ward.
He said diarrhoea is normally experienced in Mandera during rainy seasons as people tend to drink dirty water from rooftops.
A medical officer at the hospital who spoke to the Nation on condition of anonymity said the number of patients was increasing daily.
“We have just received 17 patients today alone and the isolation ward is full forcing us to set beds in the corridors to accommodate the increasing number,” said the medical officer.
DIARRHOEA CASES
He said the killer disease was confirmed on April 29, 2016 after severe cases of diarrhoea were reported in Mandera Town.
“One patient died today morning while three died yesterday but another died of similar symptoms before cholera was confirmed almost a week ago,” he said.
He said the cholera outbreak had been caused by poor hygiene and contamination in illegal food kiosks that use contaminated water.
He said the bad hygiene, coupled with poor waste disposal, were some of the factors contributing to the cholera in Mandera.
In a public notice pinned to the hospital’s notice board, the county government announced the closure of all food kiosks in Mandera Town.
“The sub-county public health office, Mandera East, has banned the preparation and sale of all foods in all makeshift structures and also hawking of food in Mandera Town,” reads the notice.
The notice further warns that anybody found operating a food kiosk without adhering to the new directives would be prosecuted.
“We have gone round assessing the environment under which these food kiosks are operating and given recommendations but if they fail to observe them then in the next two days we shall close them until we [control] the situation,” said Mr Sheikh.","Cholera outbreak kills five in Mandera, 320 others infected"

https://www.aljazeera.com:443/news/2016/5/11/philippines-the-contradictions-of-rodrigo-duterte,"Expected president’s persona as a gun-loving, motorcycle-riding womaniser with a death squad is only part of the story.
It was evident hours after the polls closed that Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte would be the next president of the Philippines. By 9pm, the votes he received equalled the sum of those cast for his two closest opponents.
The tough-talking mayor joined political allies on Monday night at a victory dinner before taking a pilgrimage to his parents’ grave at 3am – where he broke down crying, whimpering for his mama to guide him.
It was a vulnerability that contrasts with the 71-year-old Duterte’s public persona as a gun-loving, motorcycle-riding womaniser.
He is only human, after all.
Philippines election: Rodrigo Duterte claims victory
“It’s consistent with his message of healing and national unity to show the human [side] in him,” political analyst Ramon Casiple told Al Jazeera. “He did say he will be prim and proper, as the presidency requires. This is it.”
Duterte is not known for following protocol or niceties.
His survey ratings were on a steady rise until he shared his thoughts on the rape and murder of Australian missionary Jacqueline Hamill, then 36.
“The mayor should’ve gotten to her first,” Duterte said as he narrated the incident in an expletive-riddled campaign speech.
He was unapologetic for the remark despite the outrage it stirred, just as he was unrepentant for cussing at Pope Francis and the monstrous traffic caused by his 2015 visit.
“Cussing, I think, is already part of his vocabulary. But I don’t think there’s meat or flesh to every cuss word that he spews,” said campaign volunteer Jeffrey Tupas, a former journalist.
READ MORE: Why the Philippine ‘Punisher’ could be president
Tupas, 38, acknowledged that his boss is an alpha male full of contradictions. He is intimidating but a gentleman; a toughie who sponsored a centre for cancer-stricken children. He is intolerant of criminals, but annually throws a Christmas bash for the city’s prostitutes.
A private and bookish person, Duterte nevertheless frequents a local piano bar where he serenades friends with favourites such as MacArthur Park and Send in the Clowns.
“He is hard to explain as he is unpredictable,” Tupas said, noting those close to him have learned to read subtle signs when their principal is tired, angry, or when he wants to go home to sleep.
One taxi driver and supporter blamed Duterte’s seemingly belligerent language on the mayor’s inadequate grasp of Tagalog, the predominantly spoken dialect on the island of Luzon, where the seat of government and economy and the largest media agencies are based.
“[Duterte] hired a friend of mine to give him a massage one time, and she swears he was very polite and gentle, unlike what we see of him on TV,” the driver said.
Duterte lived as a boy in his father’s home town in Cebu in the central Philippines, where people spoke another dialect. When Duterte was six, his father – who later became governor of Davao – moved the young family to southern Davao City where Bisaya was also spoken.
READ MORE: The Philippines’ autocratic nostalgia
A lawyer by profession, Duterte joined the city prosecution office in 1977. After the 1986 People Power revolt, he was assigned as officer-in-charge of the city after his own mother declined the post.
He successfully contested the post for mayor in 1986 and, since then, has basically ruled the city under what might be described as a benevolent dictatorship. In those three decades, Davao City was transformed from a gangland to the fourth safest city in the region.
Civic worker Ayrie Ching said, years ago, that people migrated to Cotabato City – the heartland of the Muslim insurgency – because they thought it was safer than Davao.
“I like living in Davao, but it’s something I am able to say with a bit of discomfort – because I’m aware of my privilege … I’m not a drug addict,” said Ching, 28.
She was referring to allegations that Duterte had practically sanctioned the murder of hundreds of drug peddlers by the so-called Davao Death Squad (DDS), a paramilitary group serving as the city’s shadow police force.
Duterte helped fuel these rumours by boasting he’d killed as many as 1,700 people and pronounced that he kept his beloved city safe by butchering all criminals.
“Ultimately, my human rights background was what hindered me from voting for him,” Ching said. “I know in one way or another about the stories of the DDS and how Duterte plays into the whole thing.”
Tupas dismissed Duterte’s links to the DDS as fiction, but confirmed that the mayor drives a cab at night and prowls the city’s streets trying to catch robbers preying on taxi drivers or pedestrians.
Walking around Davao City at night is safer than in Metro Manila or Cotabato City at any time of day, he said.
It is that promise of a safer city that made many gravitate towards Duterte.
“The one thing that attracted Filipinos to agree with Duterte was that he promised quick action, cutting corners, setting aside democratic rules, even the rule of law in order to address these specific daily concerns,” Casiple explained.
His record in Davao is a showcase of what Duterte promised the rest of the country.
This early – official election results are expected in two weeks’ time – Duterte’s camp said he could apply on a nationwide basis city ordinances such as a 1am liquor ban and a 10pm curfew for minors as initial measures to address criminality.
He also promised to abolish Congress and to rewrite the Constitution. But Casiple said Duterte the president may not necessarily toe the line of Duterte the candidate.

https://business.inquirer.net/210341/smc-revive-10-b-airport-project,"CONGLOMERATE San Miguel Corp. (SMC) will revive its massive Manila Bay international airport proposal to the incoming Duterte administration to solve air congestion and signal the Philippines is serious about boosting tourism and trade.
SMC president Ramon S. Ang said the plan would showcase a world-class international airport, earlier estimated to cost $10 billion but could be built for less, as well as a possible, unprecedented alliance with the country’s biggest conglomerates that would include Manuel V. Pangilinan’s group, Henry Sy’s SM Group and Zobel-led Ayala Corp.
ADVERTISEMENT
SMC’s proposed airport would eventually replace the old Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila that is now operating beyond its intended capacity. The new airport would sit on 1,600 hectares of mainly reclaimed land in Manila Bay and was proposed two years ago to the outgoing Aquino administration.
SMC was careful not to offer to build the project due to the current administration’s bias against unsolicited proposals and instead shared plans for a potential public bidding. Even then, the project never materialized.
“I’m being invited to propose again,” Ang told the Inquirer. “So I’ll do this and will ask them to call for a public bidding. I’ll present all the designs.”
“If San Miguel is allowed to do the airport I will invite Manny Pangilinan, and Ayala and Shoemart (SM Group). All of them are welcome to be partners,” Ang added. “But as the major partner, I will invite Manny Pangilnan.”
In the last two years, the Department of Transportation and Communications tapped the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) to find a suitable location for a new international gateway. Transportation Secretary Joseph Abaya said on Friday that a Jica-backed feasibility study for Sangley Point in Cavite was still being finalized.
These new locations are being explored because the existing alternative, the Clark International Airport in Pampanga province, was deemed too far for most Metro Manila residents since it lacked efficient mass transportation access.
“There’s really no other choice,” Ang said. He said Sangley could cost up to $20 billion to build, while SMC’s Manila Bay airport would require an equity of about $2 billion to $3 billion.
“We have experience to do the reclamation. We have dredging machines, everything is complete,” Ang added.
San Miguel already operates the Caticlan Airport near Boracy Island. In 2014, it made an unsuccessful bid for the Mactan Cebu International Airport with partner Incheon Airport of South Korea. Pangilinan-led Metro Pacific Investments Corp., the SM group and Ayala also bid for the Cebu Airport public-private partnership (PPP) project that was eventually won by Filipino company Megawide Construction Corp. and India’s GMR Infrastructure.
Jose Ma. K. Lim, president of Metro Pacific, said they were open to SMC’s offer. “We have expressed interest in bidding for airports so if the government decision is to adopt RSA’s (Ang’s) proposal, we would consider it,” Lim said in a text message.

https://times.mw/when-literacy-levels-define-economic-success-of-a-nation/,"Imagine a world full of illiterate citizens. A world filled with illiterate heads of state, Members of Parliament, ministers and all those key positions you can think of.How would it be like? If it is difficult for you to imagine at universal or national level, narrow it down to an individual. Imagine you were illiterate or less literate, unable to read this article, unable to read newspapers, books, Facebook posts, tweets; unable to read and write SMS and WhatsApp messages; unable to calculate your monthly wages, bills, expenses and so on. Would you enjoy it? I guess not.If you were able to imagine, you must be literate. You are able to read and write. You are able to add up numbers. For most Malawians however, what you imagined is their state of being. They cannot ably read or write, let alone calculate.Illiteracy and low literacy is costly to both an individual and the society in which the individual lives. The consequences of illiteracy are many and harmful in several respects. As well as affecting the illiterate individuals themselves in their daily lives and often jeopardising their future, this scourge has a significant effect on society, both socially and economically.According to Literacy Foundation – Words of Hope, the consequences of illiteracy on individuals and society include limited ability to obtain and understand essential information, lower income, lower-quality jobs, reduced access to life-long learning and professional development, precarious financial position, little value is given to education and reading within the family and this often leads to intergenerational transmission of illiteracy, low self-esteem, which can lead to lack of confidence, and negative impact on health among others.Without the basic tools necessary for achieving their goals, individuals without an adequate level of literacy cannot be involved fully and on a completely equal basis in social and economical development.If Malawi could count the cost of illiteracy, it should be much higher than you can imagine. If we were to narrow it down to economic loss resulting from illiteracy and low literacy levels, Malawi has lost a lot more. Being an agricultural-based economy, Malawi’s 30 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) comes from agriculture. Smallholder farmers command 70 percent out of the 30.With national illiteracy rate pegged at 38 percent, it is common knowledge that a majority of them are smallholder farmers as illiteracy is more prevalent in rural areas. Illiteracy is higher for women (56%) than men according to a 2004 Data for rural literacy by National Statistical Office. Illiteracy makes it difficult for smallholder farmers to fully adopt and implement all the necessary good agricultural practices for them to realise potential yields per hectare. Knowledge gap makes it difficult for most of them to appreciate the value of using certified seed, using organic manure, adopting climate smart agriculture technologies, and so many other important technologies and activities for increased productivity. As a result, they yield way below the potential yield per hectare.Due to limited knowledge, even investments in programmes like Farm Input Subsidy Programme (Fisp) have brought in so little return on investment as the knowledge gap prevents most beneficiaries from properly utilising the provided inputs. Some do not follow the recommended plant spacing and plant population; as such, the inputs like fertiliser and seed are not properly utilised.Realising that this challenge has devastating effects on individuals, families, communities as well as the nation, National Smallholder Farmers’ Association of Malawi (Nasfam) embarked on an adult literacy programme where its 164,000-plus members have an opportunity to learn basic literacy and numeracy skills for advancement of their farming business as one way of improving their livelihood.“It was in 2003 when we decided to embark on adult literacy programme across Malawi in 19 districts. We noticed a gap in knowledge transfer during our farming business training sessions as well as extension service. Low literacy levels was the barring factor and leaving it unaddressed meant failure for other key components in our service delivery,” says Elles Kwanjana, Head of Capacity Building and Community Development Programme at Nasfam.“To this day, we have trained more than 37,000 smallholder farmers, mostly women in all the three regions of Malawi. So far, we are happy with the fruits of the programme.”This year, Nasfam has graduated over 1,800 students from Thyolo, Mulanje and Phalombe. Kwanjana attributes the success that most smallholder farmers are experiencing today to the adult literacy programme which has been made possible with funding from the Egmont Trust in the United Kingdom (UK) as well as the Government of Norway through the Norwegian Embassy in Malawi.She says the knowledge attained has helped most smallholder farmers come to terms with modern farming technologies, which was difficult before, resulting in improved yields.To conquer with Kwanjana, David Ali, Assistant District Agriculture Development Officer for Phalombe, says Phalombe is one of the districts where his office has encountered challenges in information transfer as most people did not go far with their primary school education.Ali says: “We have had difficulties working with most farmers on technology transfer because most of them have literacy challenges. But now that gap is narrowing as Nasfam continues to provide adult literacy lessons in the district.”He adds that “literacy helps farmers calculate the required inputs, plant spacing, the expected yields, price setting and ability to account for household expenditures.”Adding on the impact of knowledge on agriculture, Kwanjana says: “As Nasfam, we promote farming as a business. We want farmers to take all the necessary steps in production for them to achieve both increased quantities and quality. These two are key to increased income and food security at household level. With enhanced understanding, today our members are able to adopt new farming technologies with less difficulty.”Kwanjana says the numeracy skills they teach the farmers have also liberated them from exploitation by merciless traders.“Those that have gone through the literacy lessons now know the exact weight of their produce – they are able to read the scale. They also know prevailing market prices. This has given them the bargaining power. The knowledge also helps them plan for their farming business as they are taught on how to develop a basic farming business plan.”One of the beneficiaries of adult literacy is Jennifer Mamboya, a smallholder farmer from Nkhotakota.Born in 1963, Mamboya never attended formal education. It was a difficult period for her until 2013 when she registered for adult literacy lessons implemented by Nasfam in the area.“I could attend farming business trainings but never understood the content. I could not comprehend the required plant spacing let alone drawing a basic business plan for my farming business. These things were difficult to comprehend until I began literacy and numeracy lessons organised by Nasfam,” Mamboya says.So what has changed in Mamboya’s life to this day?“Adult literacy has empowered my life. I am now producing more from my farming business. In addition, I am able to negotiate better prices for my produce. As a result, it has also become easier to feed, clothe and pay school fees for my seven children,” she says.Apart from the farming business aspect, the literacy programme has also helped learners to effectively and actively participate in other social activities within their communities.“The literacy programmes provide room for self-awareness. We could see each participant becoming more active in their communities. The knowledge they attained made them more confident such that most of them are now community and farmer leaders in their various districts. With the programme, more women have been empowered to participate meaningfully in farming business and farmer groups leadership roles,” Kwanjana says.What if such efforts were duplicated and intensified? Would it make smallholder farmers contribute more to the national GDP? Would it make them more resilient to climate change shocks? Would it make national investments like Fisp more profitable?Maybe all these are just probabilities but one certain thing is that it would make Malawi a more literate nation well placed for social and economic advancement.A vibrant writer who gives a great insight on hot topics and issues",When literacy levels define economic success of a nation

The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has stepped up its communication with the Kingdom’s real estate executives in the wake of growing concern around excess supply of condominiums and sluggish demand, when compared to 2015
Recent research on Phnom Penh’s condo market by Century 21 Cambodia found that in the first six months of 2016, 13,790 off-plan condo units were launched, jumping 52 per cent compared to the previous corresponding period.
By the end of 2016, about 3,621 new condo units are slated for completion and will be released to buyers, totalling 7,093 units including the existing releases.
The growing condo supply isn’t expected to slow down any time soon, with the report anticipating available condos to reach 37,570 in 2020.
Buildings like this are fast filling up Phnom Penh’s skyline, however demand may struggle to keep up with supply. Heng Chivoan
The report noted that the largest volume ever of new condominium unit launches in 2016 had posed a hard time for primary demand to absorb the supply where only 13 per cent of the total units launched were transacted. This compares unfavourably to 2015, when 37 per cent of the total new units launched were transacted.
“A low transaction-to-stock ratio in the first six months of 2016 was due to an enormous supply currently outstripping the demand,” the report stated.
“Given the fast growing rate of new condominium launches lately, though current absorption rate takes tens of months, the existing huge supply of condos and other types of housing does not yet match the current ‘hidden’ housing demand,” the report added.
Mey Vann, director general of the Department of Financial Industry at the MEF, told Post Property over the phone last weekend that a meeting, held at the end of June did consist of discussions regarding commerce and checking on real estate development approaches, with a focus on managing supply, demand and foreign investment.
Vann added that while the ministry had regularly held such meetings, the government is now conducting those more frequently due to the flurry of activity occurring in the real estate market which calls for more attention.
When supply exceeds demand, developers must set up new market strategies. “We are trying to be a partner of the private sector because it’s an important sector for our economy,” he said.
“We demand accurate information so that we can be cautious. The number of condo units in the market keeps increasing with no change in purchasing,” Vann noted.
Sam Yang, chief executive of Eastland Development, who also joined the recent meeting, said the ministry has shown their concern over condo oversupply in Cambodia.
However, he insisted there was no need to be too worried.
“The ministry should not be worried about the condo market. Instead, they should help developers to finish their projects in time,” Yang said.
But reality tells a different story, with some condo projects that have been announced to commence stalling construction.
Little activity has been seen at The Bay condo project despite previous indications that construction had started, while construction at the Sky Villa, a luxury twin-condo set to be built just southeast of the Olympic Stadium by the end of 2017 appears to have slowed down.
Chrek Soknim, CEO of Century 21 Mekong, said there are other condo projects in Phnom Penh that remain idle; however, he would not disclose details.
Stephen Higgins, managing partner at Mekong Strategic Partners. PHOTO SUPPLIED
Michael Nhim, former manager of The Bay condo project in the Chroy Chongvar area, said three or five years down the road this much amount of condo supply will not be excessive.
He said the medium-term risk is the commune council election and the national election in 2017 and 2018 respectively. These elections, according to Nhim, can put investors and purchasers in a wait-and-see mode until the political situation is clear.
Nhim continued, “Some really did delay their construction, but they are not giving up because after the election in 2018, the market will be bigger than 2015.” He added, “The locals will adapt to condo lifestyle which will lead to a bigger market.”
When asked if investors should delay or continue their construction, Nhim said, “If I were an investor who has invested more than $100 million, I will delay the construction until after the election in 2018. However, if my investment is less than $100 million with a foreign market, I will continue to construct.”
Sear Rithy, CEO of WorldBridge Group and WorldBridge Land which is investing in The Bridge and The Peak condo developments, said there are no problems with the timeframe for its condo projects.
He said condo residents “need luxury, and convenience, and developers must supply that.”
However, he cautioned that every developer must do extensive due diligence.
“Will they be able to sell their condos? Does this condo provide necessary services to ensure a convenient lifestyle to its residents? If you are just following the trend, you should save your money instead,” Rithy said.
He continued, “For those who possess land with a foreign partner to construct, ‘don’t be too happy too soon’ because if the project is not successfully sold, they can just leave you.”
Rithy said, first and foremost, sufficient capital is mandatory in property development, also stressing on the importance of location. He admitted that projects located far from prime areas might now fail.
“Projects that are done carelessly will be stuck in the future. You should be careful,” Rithy cautioned.
Thida Ann, associate director of CBRE Cambodia, said that while the condo market in Phnom Penh is changing direction, there is no cause for alarm.
“The condo situation is not stuck. It’s just hard to sell. If you want to sell, you have to provide a special price,” she said.
“Investors should not be worried about this situation if their project has good value.”
Asked how the government should tackle the condo supply demand imbalance, Ann explained that everything is related to the Kingdom’s laws.
Ann noted that the Cambodian government has been encouraging foreign investment, which allows some projects to be placed up for sale before its construction so that they can finance their construction through sales. This can lead to some projects becoming “stuck”, she said.
In comparison, the Australian government requires an investor to finish at least 70 per cent of their construction before they have to the rights to put a development project up for sale.
She added, “Encouraging investment by allowing projects to be up for sale before its construction is a risk for the people.”
“The government should tighten the laws concerning this issue. Projects should not be up for sale before its construction.”
Meanwhile, economists seem to be erring on the side of caution when it comes to Phnom Penh’s rapidly growing property sector.
Mey Kalyan, senior advisor to the Supreme National Economic Council, said general credit in Cambodia had increased around 30 per cent, adding that this could lead to concerns regarding risk, especially in real estate.
“Credit is like fat in our body. We need the fat to function, but we also don’t need too much of it,” he continued.
Stephen Higgins, managing partner at Mekong Strategic Partners and former ANZ Royal CEO, told Post Property that demand will not be able to keep up with condo supply in the next few years.
“A lot of those condos are going to sit vacant or unsold, which ultimately will put downward pressure on rents and prices,” he said.
According to Higgins, property developers had banked on a large amount of foreign purchasing activity.
“The developers were hoping to sell to foreign buyers, and for a while that worked,” he said, noting further: “It seems now foreign buyers are realising that maybe it isn’t such a good investment, and they’re staying away.
“What the government should be concerned about though is ensuring there isn’t a large stock of unfinished buildings, the likes of which blighted Bangkok’s skyline for many years. They could do this by requiring the developers to post large completion bonds for example.”",Real estate jitters prompt government and industry meet

Climate change affects animals in a number of ways; this is happening in all parts of the world, and especially in a tropical country like Cambodia. The rainy season, which is upon the Kingdom now, is the worst season for conducting animal husbandry.
Seasonal and natural health problems such as respiratory and gastro-intestinal diseases in their animals are the most worrying factors for farmers. As a result, the growth rate and efficiency of production would be significantly reduced during this period. This then leads to a reduced quality and quantity of meat in the market, which affects many end-consumers.
Therefore, taking extra care of animals on the farm this season is the best way to protect the health and livelihoods of the animal farming business. Charoen Pokphand Foods Public Company Limited (CPF) - Animal Health Service department has a commitment: “We provide animal health solution, We protect your food.”
The past twenty years have seen CP develop the competence of animal husbandry within the country. Most animal farmers now trust CP Veterinary Drug consultants under the supervision of its own Animal Health Service.
CP strictly follows five standards in animal farming to maintain standards and the quality of our products in the swine and poultry market in our company farms and contract farming. These are:
(1) Excellent animal housing and barns
(2) Excellent animal breed
(3) Excellent management
(4) Excellent feeds
(5) Disease prevention.
The CP animal health department goes a step further and provides veterinarian technical service and training programs for the farmers in farm management.
Bio-security is one of the major concerns of the animal health department, especially this season. This is the first screening on how to protect animals from contracting the virus and reduce the risk of spreading disease agents within the farm.
Bio-security also requires the adoption of meticulous attitudes and proper protocol behavior of the farmers to lessen the risk of virus or disease. It contributes to the better health of animals.
Dr Kriangsak Laosakul, a veterinarian from CP, says, “Your good food begins with a good farm.”
Part of having a good farm is the prevention and control of diseases, which is strongly recommended by CP Vets. The CP Vet Drugs team has its own laboratory to check animal health and disease, and handles and manages all medicine and vaccine programmes needed for the farms.
Its Technical Sales team provides support and researches for the best medicine from international suppliers that are suitable for different kinds of animal situational disease on the farm. We have eight categories of Vet Drugs to support animal health and these are vaccines (for poultry and swine), antibiotics, support-drugs (such as vitamins and minerals), alternative medicines, insecticides, disinfectants, pest control and miscellaneous. This ensures that CP Vet Drugs can cater all your animal health issues.
“Your animal health is my job,” says Dr. Dedduang Ondum, Assistant Vice President for Vet Drug Business.
The CP Animal Health Department is more than willing to engage Cambodian farmers in the overall animal husbandry industry, and will be glad to get you started on your animal husbandry business. Our animal health technical team experts are available to provide you with advice and consultations. In this way, Cambodians will stand to gain more knowledge in animal health, and produce quality meats for the good of the country.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/comment-newspaper/an-enabling-force-in-india-s-growth-story/story-LVNTjrtjOKjKqe4iLJaVvL.html,"The 2011 census tells us that 6-7% of the population, or 70-90 million people, in India are disabled. The actual numbers are larger. According to a WHO estimate, there are 1 billion Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) globally — which means 15% of the world population, on average, is disabled. Logically, India too will have 15% or more PwDs. But that figure doesn’t show up in surveys and studies thanks to the fact that disability is a social taboo and goes unreported. This is in addition to the fact that the definition of disability framed by India fails to effectively identify all PwDs. The Persons with Disability Act, 1995, adopts a medical definition. In reality, society tends to view impairment beyond the medical definition.
But there is hope. Even considering the conservative 6% figure for PwDs, somewhere between 3m to 5m are educated. In 1999, the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People observed that only 100,000 were employed in corporate India — even today not much has changed. The average employment rate of disabled people in the private sector was only 0.28% and in the public sector it was at 0.54%. A 2008 study commissioned by the Planning Commission showed why the figures were so abysmal: PwDs are unaware of their employment rights, the source of information was employment exchanges and television with both proving to be ineffective, and many states were not observing the guidelines set for employing PwDs. There is lack of social, administrative and political will.
The good news is that labour markets are improving. The IMF forecasts India’s growth rate will stay at 7.5% for 2016-17. If this continues, it will lead to an expansion in labour markets. For the next few years, India will look for inexpensive, but reliable, labour — and where will this labour come from? The educated but invisible PwD segment can help fill this gap. This is pool of talent has proven that it is dependable, focused, productive and loyal.
The question is: How do we skill them appropriately for industry requirements in the coming months? The first step is to focus on policies that protect the rights of PwDs, inform them of the available opportunities, ensure access to training, and create methodologies to fund the training or make loans available to PwDs.
Some of this work has already been initiated. The department of empowerment of persons with disabilities under the ministry of social justice and empowerment has begun to put such steps in place. Simultaneously, the idea of roping in not-for-profit organisations to assist PSUs (to meet their 3% commitment to hiring PwDs) and private organisations in identifying and training PwDs in emerging industry skills can provide a major boost. These PSUs can focus on creating interactive e-content for training, find funding for development of new assistive devices and identify models for co-investment with corporate training institutes.
These are not overly ambitious ideas and with a little will, they can become a reality.

However, by this year-end, we might be able to use our mobile phones to make cashless, contactless payments at physical stores too, like online transactions. That’s when a technology being pioneered by a Bengaluru startup, ToneTag, is rolled out.Kumar Abhishek, Co-Founder and CEO, is bullish about this becoming a reality, mainly because neither the merchant nor the consumer need to instal any new hardware. The merchant can use the same infrastructure like card-swiping machine or computer terminal, and the consumer can use the same mobile phone. All that is needed is the integration of the ToneTag technology.The process is simple. The merchant enters the amount on his machine, and taps enter; the customer opens the bank app on the phone, presses the ToneTag icon, and brings the phone close to the PoS terminal. Within about 10 seconds or even less, the payment is done.Currently pilot projects are being run with various banks, and rollout is expected around October this year.Mr. Abhishek said with the integration of Beacon technology, ToneTag enables even customized two-way proximity communication between retailers and customers too. Stores will be able to send them targeted, relevant offers once the users are near the retail stores.NEXUS DEVICES GET NOUGATThe latest Android operating system, 7.0 Nougat, is rolling out to Nexus devices.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/pm-pushpa-kamal-dahal-hopes-best-2nd-innings-office,"KATHMANDU: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has expressed his commitment to perform in the best way possible so that people would remember him for long during his current premiership.
Receiving a delegation from Dhikurpokhari Kathmandu Society at the PM's official residence on Monday, Dahal said ""Last time I had not known that I should leave the government in nine months, so I could not complete many tasks. But this time, I would do such works so that they would be remembered by country and people for years.""
In the programme, PM Dahal informed that implementation of the Constitution with an amendment, holding local, provincial and federal elections, conclusion of peace process and bringing effectiveness and progress in public service would be the major priorities of the government.
""The country needs a road map to prosperity. I am planning to do result-oriented works for it,"" a statement issued by the PM's Secretariat quoted Dahal as saying.
Mentioning that his birthplace Dhikurpokhari has developed a lot in the educational sector, the PM further said that he would extend support for constructing infrastructures and developing technical sector in the place.
Suggesting Dahal to file candidacy from Kaski-4 in the next Parliamentary elections, representatives of the society also urged PM Dahal to support different sectors of the district including physical infrastructure.",PM Dahal hopes to do his best during 2nd innings in office
http://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-tax-property-idUSL3N1AT23Y,"JAKARTA, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Indonesia is cutting in half a tax on home sales from September, according to a presidential regulation, a move that should help the country's property sector.
The sellers of homes will be subject to a final tax of 2.5 percent of the transaction price, instead of the current 5 percent, based to the regulation signed by President Joko Widodo on Aug. 8.
For purchases of homes smaller than 36 square meters, the rate will be only 1 percent. The regulation said this is ""to give protection for citizens with low income"".
Ken Dwijugiasteadi, head of Indonesia's tax office, told Reuters on Friday the measure is ""to support the property sector and to help aid purchasing power because one of the people's primary need is to own a house"".
Trimegah Securities said the regulation should benefit property companies such as PT Modernland Realty Tbk and PT Intiland Development Tbk.
It said they should expect better net margins, and that the regulation ""should offset high interest cost, which ultimately leads to heightened dividend payment ability"".
Sales in the country's residential market rose 4.02 percent in April-June from the previous quarter, when they increased 1.51 percent, a recent Bank Indonesia survey showed.
In June, the central bank announced it would ease downpayment requirements for property lending in August in a bid to spur sector growth. Officials have said regulations backing the changes would be released soon.

https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/kicking-off-poll-campaign-mayawati-slams-bjp-rss-sp-is-soft-on-congress-uttar-pradesh-2989226/,"Sending clear signals about her pre-poll strategy for Uttar Pradesh, BSP chief Mayawati Sunday slammed the BJP and RSS — she even targeted Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat — and told people that SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav once “conspired to attack” her. But she almost spared the Congress.
Launching her election campaign at a huge rally in Agra, Mayawati kept the focus on Dalits, Muslims and the most backward, repeatedly hitting out at “capitalists and money bags” and accusing the BJP of gaining power with their support. She also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his “monumental failure on the front of social welfare”.
Hoping to consolidate her voteshare among Dalits and Muslims, she said religious crime and persecution of Muslims have increased under BJP rule. “They victimise Muslims in the name of gau raksha, aatankwad and love jihad. We must stop BJP from coming to power. Otherwise, development will be secondary and the strategy of RSS will be served first,” she said.
In a rare attack on Bhagwat, she said while “poverty and unemployment have increased”, the “RSS chief is saying that Hindus should produce more children”.
“I want to tell the RSS head that while you are asking Hindus to produce more children, you should also ask Narendra Modi and his government if they will be able to give them means of employment? People are already suffering, what will happen to them when they have more children?”
Targeting Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav who recently called her “bua”, she said that Mulayam Singh Yadav once “conspired to attack me… so, what moral right does his son have to call me bua”.
She said the SP “deliberately uses its family tussle to deflect the attention of people” from any major incident and “when the situation normalises, they begin praising each other”.

On the Congress, she said the party wants to garner support of the upper castes and “has made an old Brahmin woman the CM candidate who had blamed the people of UP and Bihar for Delhi’s filth during her regime… her government misused funds meant for Dalits”.

Over the next three Sundays, Mayawati will address gatherings in three different parts of the state — Azamgarh (August 28), Allahabad (September 4) and Saharanpur (September 11). Her present phase of campaigning will end in Lucknow on October 9, before the party draws a new schedule after Diwali.

The Agra rally catered to some 40 assembly seats of Agra and Aligarh zones and she assured all the probables present that their tickets were “confirmed”. The BSP has internally announced candidates for almost each of the 403 seats. Her ticket composition confirms her focus as at least 100 are Muslims, over 50 Brahmins, 50 Thakurs, Vaishyas and other upper castes, while Dalits, OBCs and MBCs constitute the remaining 200.

She accused the BJP government of failing its electoral promise of the 2014 elections. “The BJP had promised to bring back black money, and said that every poor person would be given Rs 15-20 lakh,” she said, adding that “not a single person has received this amount”.
The BJP, she told the crowd, ruled Uttar Pradesh for six years, but “instead of focusing on development, it strengthened the RSS agenda”.
During the Lok Sabha election campaign, Modi had promised to “give cheap government ration”, “free electricity” and “homes to homeless people from government funds”. “Did Narendra Modi give you homes?” She said it was due to her “pressure” that the BJP was forced to withdraw its land acquisition Bill that was “against the poor”.
She alleged that the BJP came to power because of “capitalists” and “money bags”. “Government banks under the central government have waived 1 lakh 14 thousand crore debt of capitalists and moneybags in the last three years,” she said, adding that small traders are forced to commit suicide because they are pressured to pay even small debts.
She accused the BJP of “breaking into the vote bank of the BSP”, mentioning the ongoing Dhamma Chetna Yatra and said it was trying to woo community members in the name of Buddhism. She said the BJP “shaved heads of some RSS members, made them fake Dalits, and fake Buddha monks” and “launched a Dhamma Chetna Yatra”.

But the Una incident and Dayashankar Singh’s remarks against her, she said, have united Dalits against the BJP and RSS across the country. She said the BJP might once again “foist the slogan of Tilak, Tarazu aur Talwar” on the BSP and “mislead upper castes”.
She clarified that “if the BSP had any such perception towards the upper castes, our party would not have given upper castes the top posts”.
Advertisement
Mayawati even blamed a section of media “controlled by capitalists” for trying to “provide benefits to the parties they are associated with”.
She mentioned that some months ago, survey agencies had rated BSP as the number one party for the UP elections, but it was “the conspiracy of capitalists” to “make the BSP complacent” and help the BJP.","Kicking off Uttar Pradesh poll campaign, Mayawati slams BJP-RSS, SP, is soft on Congress"

He said it was also to support Ghana’s growth and poverty reduction drive and capable of positioning the country as the transportation hub of the West African sub region.
“Unlike previous instances when our focus used to be primarily on the road network, the emphasis is now more on construction that takes into account the social needs of the catchment areas of road projects,” he said.
“The focus has now moved to the provision of social services such as schools, potable water, health facilities, alternative livelihood opportunities, tourism infrastructure, and markets, among others as part of the road improvement works.”
Alhaji Fuseini cited the upgrading of 147.5 kilometer Fufulso-Sawla road project designed to include provision of some ancillary works to enhance livelihoods of people within project area.
The additional works included provision of an integrated water purification plant, rehabilitation and expansion of district hospital and health centres in addition to construction of nurses’ quarters.
Others are construction of schools and teachers’ bungalows, construction of markets and lorry parks, rehabilitation of grain storage sheds as well as construction of solar powered boreholes.
“The provision of these ancillaries has contributed to poverty reduction by increasing access to markets and social services for the surrounding areas, and communities,” he said.
It has also empowered the rural poor, women and other disadvantaged groups through adequate roadside socio-economic infrastructure and services.
The Minister also cited the construction of the 110 kilometer Agona Junction to Elubo road in the Western Region which seeks to open up the country to its western neighbour – La Cote d’Ivoire – and facilitate intra and inter-regional trade.
He said the project aims at encouraging tourism activities by easing access to tourist sites such as Fort St Antonion and the Ankasa Forest Reserve.
“It is expected that the completion of all these roads [ongoing in the country] will help in the achievement of government’s objective of providing an integrated, efficient, cost-effective and sustainable transportation system.”

The two reservoirs together used to supply 40 million gallons per day till they went dry failing to meet city’s requirement of 355 mgd.The hopes of good inflows into the city reservoirs following copious rain across the State took a beating when the swollen streams of Ranga Reddy district did not initially bring much inflows into the reservoirs. Questions were raised by the experts and lay persons alike and theories were propounded over what could have gone wrong for these two reservoirs that supplied water to the city by gravity.But reviving hopes once again, Osmansagar, according to HMWSSB officials, touched storage capacity of 1.43 tmc ft as against its total capacity of 3.9 tmc ft as on Saturday. “We are quite hopeful that it will touch 2 tmc ft by the end of this monsoon, by September 30,” they said. This is a huge relief as the twin reservoirs went totally dry and the Metro Water Supply Board stopped drawing water from them from November, 2015.The two reservoirs, only about 15 km from the city, if filled to the brim, can supply 40 mgd for at least two years with hardly any cost as the water flows by gravity unlike the Krishna and Godavari drinking water schemes. The inflows started reaching the reservoirs from the catchment areas of Vikarabad, Anantagiri, Parigi etc., in Ranga Reddy in the second spell of rains from September 16 onwards. But in comparison, inflows into Himayathsagar reservoir remain meagre and its storage level touched 0.4 tmc ft as against the storage capacity of 2.96 tmc ft. “We are not very hopeful as we don’t see good flow in the streams that reach Himayatsagar”.The HMWSSB officials said that they propose to supply water to the city again from Osmansagar reservoir, about 25 mgd, in about a week or 10 days after inspecting the open conduit which was not in use for the last six months.

This week has been very difficult, particularly for Rwandan sports and whoever takes trouble to follow it or, if I may be a bit more general, anyone, who wishes it well.
Forget the 14 places that Rwanda improved in the latest FIFA rankings and APR’s win over DR Congo’s giants AS Vita Club in the final of the ‘AS Kigali Pre-season tournament’ or whatever other positive that you may have read or heard somewhere within the past seven days.
Hamza Nkuutu
For me, what has been the real news, and very sad indeed to say the least, was to hear that two of Rwanda’s best active sportsmen; Hermas Muvunyi and Janvier Hadi are retiring and there are no plans regarding who will replace them in terms of deed for deed.
It’s not very often that you come across sportsmen or women hanging up their boots when at the top, and most especially when they’re still relatively young and loved by their countrymen.
Rwanda’s most decorated Paralympian Muvunyi announced his retirement, drawing curtains on a glittering nine-year career after failing to win a medal at 2016 Rio Paralympic Games—he made his Paralympic debut four years ago in London.
The 28-year old, who began his career in the able-bodied category, was introduced to Paralympic competitions five years ago, making his debut at the 2011 All-Africa Games in Maputo where he won gold in the 400 meters and silver in 800m, which qualified him for the 2012 London Paralympic Games.
Muvunyi became the first Rwandan world champion after winning gold in the 800m T-46 at the International Paralympic Committee-Athletics World Championships in Lyon, France in 2013 before winning the 400m gold at the All African Games in Congo-Brazzaville in 2015.
He added two more gold medals to his CV winning both the 400 and 800 meters at the 9th IPC Grand Prix de Tunis in March this year. His last gold medal came in the 1500 meter T-46 during the Berlin Open Grand Prix two months ago in Germany.
These achievements make Muvunyi, Rwanda’s most decorated athlete or sportsman for that matter, and it will be very difficult if not impossible for anyone else to match him.
I say this because, there appears to be no deliberate plan whatsoever by the Rwanda National Paralympic Committee to groom any young and upcoming athletes to fill the void that has been created with Muvunyi’s retirement.
Before Muvunyi arrived on the Paralympic scene, there was Jean de Dieu Nkundabera, who competed at the 2004 and 2008 Paralympic Games in Athens and Beijing respectively.
Nkundabera won Rwanda’s only Paralympic medal (bronze) at the Athens Games but that’s all one can say about him as he never won any other major international championships as his successor, Muvunyi did.
Attention will of course now turn to Jean Claude Ndayisenga, who competes in the 400m T-47 category but has not done or showed enough to suggest he could be Muvunyi’s successor and at 25 years, he is getting older, which means his chances of competing at the highest level are getting slimmer.
Ndayisenga’s best achievement thus far is a bronze medal that he won at this year’s Berlin Grand Prix where he clocked 55 seconds and 47 microseconds, but missed out on the Rio Paralympic Games qualification mark.
Enter Hadi
Hadi, one of three Rwandan professional cyclists along with Adrien Niyonshuti and Jean Bosco Nsengimana, shocked the nation when he announced early this week that he was quitting the sport.
His untimely retirement comes barely a year after he joined Germany-based UCI Continental team Stradalli–Bike Aid together with Nsengimana, who remains at the club and is expected to lead their charge when he attempts to defend his Tour du Rwanda title.
Hadi, still only 25, which is a relatively young age in professional cycling, attributed his decision to leave the stage on what he described as dishonest and unfair treatment by the local cycling governing body, FERWACY, which is headed by Aimable Bayingana.
Hadi’s troubles started last year when he became the first Rwandan to win a gold medal at the 2015 All-Africa Games in Congo-Brazzaville hence qualifying for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games cycling road race, only to be replaced with Niyonshuti but the latter could only manage 50km of the 236km race.
The decision by FERWACY to deny him a life-time opportunity to compete at the Olympic Games, did not go down well with Hadi—and to make matter even worse, the explanation that the federation gave for preferring the more experienced Niyonshuti, only left more questions than answers.
Hadi and many others like myself, felt he deserved his shot at the Olympics, more so given the fact that he had worked for it but when he was denied that chance and then given unconvincing reasons, it must have broke not only his heart but completely destroyed his appetite and passion for the sport altogether.
Having said that, I still believe Muvunyi and Hadi can still be convinced to change their minds and reverse their decisions to retire, because at 28 and 25 years respectively—the duo is still too young and productive to simply leave the stage when the country still needs them.
Those responsible for these two young men, but particularly Hadi, need to put aside any differences, whether in opinion or anything else that may have led to his hasty retirement and ‘re-integrate’ him back in the system because only Hadi can do what Hadi has been doing for Team Rwanda Cycling.

The ambulance driver had allegedly asked the girl’s parents to get down after coming to know that the girl has died on the way to Malkangiri district hospital.
Barsha Khemudu of Ghusapalli in Malkangiri died while being taken by her parents in the ambulance from Mithali hospital from where she was referred to Malkangiri district hospital following deterioration in her health condition.
“The driver asked us to get down from the ambulance as soon as he came to know about the girl’ s death on the way,” Dinabandhu Khemudu, the girl’s father, said.
The matter came to light when locals inquired about Khemudu and his wife walking carrying the body of their daughter. The villagers then contacted the local BDO and medical authorities to get another vehicle to carry the body to their village.
Malkangiri district collector K Sudarshan Chakravarthy has asked the chief district medical officer Uday Shankar Mishra to probe the matter. The CDMO has filed an FIR at Malkangiri police station against the driver, a pharmacist and an attendant who were in the ambulance.
“It was totally illegal and criminal negligence on the part of the driver. Stringent action will be taken against persons responsible for the incident,” Chakravarthy told reporters, adding the district administration has provided immediate financial assistance to the girl’s parents.
When contacted, Mishra said the act was “inhuman”. “After coming to know of the incident, I immediately sent another vehicle which dropped the girl’s family at their village,” he said.
Dana Majhi had to walk about 10km from Bhawanipatna in Kalahandi district along with his teenage daughter on August 24 carrying his wife’s body on his shoulders after allegedly being denied a hearse by the district hospital.","Ambulance leaves midway, father carries child’s corpse"

 Soyinka affirmed that the young and upcoming entrepreneurs in the country, regardless of their religious backgrounds and denominations, would help put the economic wheel of the country in a working and stable condition.
 According to him, entrepreneurship is devoid of religious affiliations, rather, it must be based on sound business ethics and practice.He also appealed to the young entrepreneurs to see insurance as a very integral part of their business as it is the only assurance to the sustainability of their wealth creation.
 “Nigeria is highly blessed with so much natural and human resources which has translated to a lot of wealth creation in the form of businesses and commercial activities that we see around us in the country today but the big question is how many of these businesses have that continuity and longevity elements that insurance provide,” he stated.
 Speaking further, he said there are enormous advantages in embracing insurance and making it a way of life, stressing that one can never go wrong with it.He commended the organisers in ensuring that the spirit of entrepreneurship thrives amongst youths in the country.
 He called on all other well-meaning organisations and individuals in the country to continue to support homegrown businesses as a way of stimulating the Nigerian economy especially at this time of our receding economy.
 He added that Nigerians do not need to be compelled to do what will add value to their lives rather; they should cultivate a proactive culture of sustaining their wealth and business concerns through a consistent insurance culture.

Atencio said the company would just be able to launch 11 projects this year, instead of 14 as originally planned, because the company failed to secure necessary permits to enable it to start selling the projects. Atencio, however, said the shortfall from the delay in launching the three projects could be covered by the robust sales of existing projects, including Deca Tower Edsa which would be finished a year ahead of schedule. “We still have a shot at making our guidance because we have some projects we did not expect this year to contribute to revenues but they will be because they are ahead of schedule,” Atencio said.

A commercial court on Monday said the “traders cause immense suffering” to other street users and thus should move out.
“As correctly pointed out by lawyer Titus Koceyo for the Nairobi City County, all other users of city streets suffer undue hardship, inconvenience and are subjected to chaotic environments due to hawkers spreading their goods without order,” Chief Magistrate Peter Muholi ruled.
Mr Muholi dismissed two cases filed by the hawkers, through lawyers Elizabeth Muthoni Karanja and Sheila Mugo, seeking to restrain county askaris from harassing, arresting or interfering with their operations at Plot Zero on Moi Avenue and also on Tom Mboya Street.
He stated that county government officers are mandated to ensure “there is good environment of doing business, hence tasked with ensuring there is order; licence all business and generally be in charge of their counties.”
Declining to bar city askaris from confiscating goods from the traders, Mr Muholi said the hawkers cannot be allowed to “operate from all corners of Moi Avenue or Tom Mboya Street.”
Mr Muholi said any loss suffered by the hawkers failing to access their trade can be remedied through damages and advised them “to engage the licencing organ on approvals and allocation of specific areas of trading.”
Lawyers Karanja and Mugo, for the over 500 hawkers, had urged the court through their seven representatives to restrain the city askaris from interfering, harassing, intimidating, unlawfully arresting or confiscating the hawkers’ goods or items while at their designated areas at Plot Zero.",Court orders Nairobi hawkers out of Nairobi streets

I am a British citizen, but my fiancÈ is not. If I marry him, will I be able to keep my own British citizenship if I choose to apply for citizenship of another country?
- S.E.
Dear S.E.,
Dual citizenship, which is also known as dual nationality, is allowed in the United Kingdom. This means that persons can be a British citizen and also a citizen of other countries.
Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters.
It should be noted that persons with British citizenship do not need to apply for dual citizenship, as they can apply for foreign citizenship and keep their British citizenship.
However, persons should be aware that many countries do not accept dual citizenship and it is advisable that persons check with the country's consulate or embassy in the United Kingdom to find out about that country's laws on dual nationality.
In addition, a person is not permitted to have dual citizenship if he/she is a British subject or a British protected person, unless he/she is a British subject from the Republic of Ireland.
Please be aware that until 1949, nearly everyone with a close connection to the United Kingdom was called a 'British subject'. All citizens of Commonwealth countries were British subjects until January 1983. However, since 1983, very few people have qualified as British subjects.
WORTH NOTING
Just for completeness with respect to applying for British citizenship, it is worth noting that there has been no change to the rights and status of European Union nationals in the United Kingdom, and United Kingdom nationals in the European Union, as a result of the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum (Brexit).
In order to obtain British citizenship in the United Kingdom, persons should apply for citizenship in the normal way, and the most common way is through naturalisation.
Persons should also be aware that as a dual national, they cannot get diplomatic help from the British government when they are in the other country where they hold citizenship.
In addition, a person does not automatically become a British citizen when he/she marries a person from the United Kingdom. In such a case, the person will need to apply as the spouse of a British citizen.
In some countries, a married person is automatically counted as having their partner's nationality. Children may also automatically have a parent's nationality even if they were born abroad.

https://phnompenhpost.com/national/banned-rosewood-trade,"Banned rosewood trade up
Despite the presence of a blanket ban by the Cambodian government on all trade in Siamese rosewood since 2013, exports of the precious timber to Vietnam increased in the third quarter of this year, according to Vietnamese customs data compiled by US-based NGO Forest Trends.
Between January and June, 17 cubic metres of rosewood, valued at $38,151, were registered as entering Vietnam from Cambodia. By the end of September, that figure had increased more than five-fold to 90 cubic metres, with a registered total value of $258,983.
In 2013, the same year that Cambodia outlawed its trade, Siamese rosewood was listed by the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as a protected species.
Under the convention, cross-border trade in listed species must be accompanied by import and export permits issued by both countries’ CITES Management Authorities (MAs), which are staffed by employees of each countries’ government.
Neither the Cambodian nor Vietnamese MAs responded to requests for comment yesterday. However, the Cambodian MA has repeatedly denied having issued export permits for Siamese rosewood in the past three years since Phnom Penh banned its trade.
For its part, the Vietnamese MA has repeatedly insisted that it only allows imports of Siamese rosewood when accompanied by a valid CITES export permit issued by the Cambodian MA.
Vietnam has produced copies of export permits and verification emails dating between 2013 and 2015 in support of its claim, which the Cambodian MA has in turn denounced as forgeries. In September, Interpol was invited to assist in an investigation into the controversy.
NGO Environmental Investigation Agency senior forest campaigner Jago Wadley said in an email yesterday that Vietnam had no business accepting imports of Siamese rosewood from Cambodia in 2016.
“In late 2014 at the latest Vietnam’s CITES MA had been explicitly informed by Cambodia’s MA that that Cambodia had outright banned the harvest, domestic trade, or export of Siamese rosewood,” Wadley said. “Vietnam should have refused all and any applications to import Siamese rosewood . . . from that point onwards.”
“Vietnam’s apparent acceptance of further Siamese rosewood imports as late as 2016 suggests Vietnam may be in wilful violation of the spirit, if not the rules of CITES. Vietnam had reason to believe trade was neither legal nor sustainable, yet appear [to] have abandoned those facts in favour of permitting ongoing trade,” he said.",Banned rosewood trade up

BY OWN CORRESPONDENT
The Chitungwiza-based singer, famed for the apostolic choral hit song Garai Muchinamata, said she has released an instrumental album meant to cater for a wider audience.
A Kuwadzana Apostolic Church member, Jani rose to fame through singing apostolic choral songs before introducing instruments a few years ago.
“I am diversifying. I will release an album laden with apostolic choral songs next year. For now, I have to use instruments to cater for a wider audience and I am happy with how the album is being played on local radio stations,” she said.
“This is my second album with instrumental songs, before I revert back to choral music. I am not limited to
a capella. I am happy that my sixth album is out and the response from my fans and other gospel music fans is refreshing.”
Songs on the latest album include Hana Yako, Vana Venyu, Ropafadzo, Jesu and Mubatsiri.
The album was recorded at Hojobwe Studios in Chitungwiza.
Being a female figure to lead an apostolic choral group in a male-dominated industry with established groups like Vabati VaJehovah, Chiedza CheVatendi and Vabati VeVhangeri, Jani became a popular a capella musician through her debut album that carried the hit song Garai Muchinamata.
The song was accompanied by a video that became popular on local television shows.
Her other albums include Tungamirai Jehovha, Donhodzo Romweya, Hupenyu Idova, Mira Namwari Wako and Pasi Idandaro.

https://usa.inquirer.net/778/americans-retiring-outside-us,"Newly widowed, Kay McCowen quit her job, sold her house, applied for Social Security and retired to Mexico. It was a move she and her husband, Mel, had discussed before he passed away in 2012.
“I wanted to find a place where I could afford to live off my Social Security,” she said. “The weather here is so perfect, and it’s a beautiful place.”
ADVERTISEMENT
She is among a growing number of Americans who are retiring outside the United States. The number grew 17 percent between 2010 and 2015 and is expected to increase over the next 10 years as more baby boomers retire.
Just under 400,000 American retirees are now living abroad, according to the Social Security Administration. The countries they have chosen most often: Canada, Japan, Mexico, Germany and the United Kingdom.
Retirees most often cite the cost of living as the reason for moving elsewhere, said Olivia S. Mitchell, director of the Pension Research Council at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.
Stretching dollars
“I think that many people retire when they are in good health and they are interested in stretching their dollars and seeing the world,” Mitchell said.
McCowen’s rent in Ajijic, a community outside Guadalajara near Mexico’s Lake Chapala, is half of what she was paying in Texas. And since the weather is moderate, utility bills are inexpensive.
In some countries, Mitchell said, retirees also may find it less expensive to hire someone to do their laundry, clean, cook and even provide long-term care than in the United States.
McCowen has a community of other American retirees nearby and has adjusted well.
But for others there are hurdles to overcome to adjust to life in a different country.

Viviana Rojas, an associate professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio, says the biggest obstacle is not speaking the language or knowing the culture.
“Many of the people we interviewed said they spoke Spanish, but they actually spoke very little Spanish,” said Rojas, who is writing a book about retirees in Mexico. “They didn’t have the capacity of speaking enough Spanish to meet their basic needs like going to the doctor or to the store.”
Access to health care also can be a challenge. While retirees still can receive Social Security benefits, Medicare is not available to those living abroad, Mitchell said.
Higher cost of living but..
Joseph Roginski, 71, says that while the cost of living is higher in Japan, access to health care is not. “Things are very expensive here. It is impossible to live off Social Security alone,” said Roginski, who was stationed in Japan in 1968. “But health insurance is a major factor in staying here.”
The former military language and intelligence specialist said he pays $350 annually to be part of Japan’s national health insurance. His policy covers 70 percent of his costs. The rest is covered by a secondary insurance program for retired military personnel.
Japan experienced the biggest growth of American retirees — at 42 percent — and more than any other country between 2010 and 2014, according to data from the Social Security Administration. The large U.S. military presence in the country may be a factor.
There are more than 50,000 U.S. military servicemen and -women stationed in Japan. The presence is so large that in the island of Okinawa, the U.S. military occupies about 19 percent of the area, according to Ellis S. Krauss, professor emeritus of Japanese politics and policy-making at the University of California, San Diego.
Roginski, who volunteers for the Misawa Air Base Retiree Activities Office, said he helps connect more than 450 retirees and their families living in Northern Japan with resources. He said he would never move back to the United States.
“We have a real strong sense of security here,” he said. “I can leave my door unlocked and no one will take anything. When I go to another country I feel nervous, but when I come back I feel like I’m home.”
Mexico home
Mexico has become home for retired firefighter, Dan Williams, 72, and his wife, Donna, 68. The couple has been living near the same retirement community in Lake Chapala for 14 years.
“The climate and the medical services are very good,” Williams said.
Williams teaches painting to adults and children and puts together a monthly magazine for the local American Legion. He is also a member of the Lake Chapala Society, which offers daily activities for American retirees.
It was those same services that attracted McCowen to the region.
“Before moving, I found out how many widowed and divorced women lived here,” she said. “There is comfort in numbers.”
She says she loves being in a lively community.
“I see older people walking year round. I see them all over the place, even in their wheelchairs. If they were in the U.S., they would probably be in a nursing home,” she said. “I don’t think I could move back.”",More Americans retiring outside of the US

The decision was taken by the Sentence Appeals Court of San Jose.
The four men received 35 years of prison for murder, but due to the fact that they were also found guilty of other crimes such as aggravated robbery, rape and deprivation of personal freedom (for another case that was tried at the same time), the sentence added up to 87 years of prison for Centeno and Quesada and 79 years to Donald Salmon; while Cash Lopez was sentenced to a total of 90 years of prison since he was also found guilty of rape (in a different case). However all terms will be adjusted to 50 years in prison since that is the maximum the Costa Rican law allows.
The other three defendants in this case, William Delgado Loaiza, Felipe Arauz and Darwin Salmon Mendez were acquitted in May due to lack of evidence.

The five candidates competing in the Bekasi regent election in West Java are labeling themselves with unique abbreviations to help voters remember them more easily. The candidates have also creatively utilized the abbreviations to come up with attractive slogans.
Labor activist-turned-regent candidate Obon Tabroni and running his mate Bambang Sumaryono, for example, have come up with the abbreviation ""Obama"" to mimic former United States president Barack Obama.
""Obama"" is an independent ticket that has been permitted to run after collecting support from 143,222 Bekasi residents, mostly workers.
""We came up with the nickname spontaneously. One of us shouted 'just call it Obama', and then we all agreed,"" Obon's campaign team leader Nono Mitsuba told The Jakarta Post on Friday.
""[Barack] Obama is a good figure. He was the first black president who cared a lot about all of his people without exception. We hope that Obon can be a leader like that,"" Nono added.

The 1,200 MW storage type scheme is being built on the Budhi Gandaki River.Among the 400 compensation applications forwarded to the DAO Gorkha by the Budhi Gandaki Hydroelectric Project Development Committee, 96 have been verified by the Land Revenue and Survey offices; and both have given the green signal to the DAO to issue payment. The applicants have opened bank accounts with Rastriya Banijya Bank, and the DAO will deposit the compensation amount in their accounts after they transfer their title deeds to the project.  As of now, around 700 households have submitted applications to the project development committee expressing their readiness to transfer their land to the project in return for compensation. The remaining 500 households are in the process of filling applications, according to the project development committee.  The DAO has received Rs2.5 billion from the Finance Ministry to distribute compensation. “After making payment to the 96 households, we will continue distributing compensation to other households of the three VDCs,” said Jitendra Basnet, chief district officer (CDO) of Gorkha district. “It will take around a month and a half for us to distribute Rs2.5 billion to Gorkha locals.”Likewise, the DAO Dhading, another project affected district, has received Rs2.5 billion from the Finance Ministry for compensation distribution. It has also started work to distribute compensation to landowners in Salang, Maidi and Khari VDCs in the district. Gopal Basnet, executive director of the project development committee, said compensation distribution would have been lot quicker if there was adequate human resources at the Land Revenue and Survey offices to process the documents. “Nevertheless, both DAOs are about ready to start issuing payment,” said Basnet. “And, it is a welcome move.” According to the project development committee’s estimates, the total cost of acquiring around 58,000 ropanis of land in 27 VDCs of Gorkha and Dhading districts will exceed Rs50 billion.The compensation distribution committees of the two districts have fixed the compensation rate at Rs524,000 to Rs835,000 per ropani.The land to be acquired by the project has been classified into five categories — paddy field, small farm land, land in market area, land adjoining a road and land near human settlements. Paddy fields and small farm lands have been further classed into four grades, with the compensation amount for the first grade being the highest.According to the latest report by the project development committee, more than 8,000 households will be affected by the project.The reservoir of the storage project will completely submerge 3,560 houses and the occupants will need to be resettled with proper compensation.

http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sun-pharm-results-idUSKBN15T23B,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, India’s largest drugmaker, reported its first fall in quarterly profits in a year on Tuesday, as pricing issues and supply constraints affected sales in the United States, its largest market.
A logo of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd is pictured at its research and development center in Mumbai, India, December 21, 2015. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade
Sun’s U.S. business faces increasing uncertainty as it struggles to fix quality control problems found by regulators at its key drug factories, and is the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into increases in drug prices.
On Tuesday the world’s fifth-largest generic drugs maker sought to allay those concerns by saying its focus was on high-margin ‘specialty’ products.
“The idea for us is to improve our supply and regain market share ... our plan is to create a very successful specialty business,” billionaire founder and Managing Director Dilip Shanghvi told analysts on a conference call.
U.S. supplies have been hit over the past year after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found violations in manufacturing practices at Sun’s Halol factory in western India. Sun has spent months trying to resolve those concerns but the FDA outlined further problems with the plant in an inspection report in December.
Shanghvi said on Tuesday the company hoped to be able to fix the problems at Halol “over the next few quarters.”
Some other factories that the drugmaker took over with the acquisition of rival Ranbaxy in 2014 are still barred from supplying.
Sun said it was cooperating with a U.S. Department of Justice investigation, under which several drugmakers were subpoenaed last year. “We have followed the law in the U.S. and all our people have followed appropriate behavior,” Shanghvi said.
Chief Financial Officer Uday Baldota said competitive pressures also continued to affect the U.S. business.
Sun earlier reported a 4 percent rise in U.S. sales in the final three months of 2016, but its total net profit fell to 14.72 billion rupees ($220 million) from 15.45 billion rupees in the same period of 2015. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 17.83 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S Estimates.
The company’s majority-owned U.S. subsidiary Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd last week reported a 15 percent drop in quarterly sales for the same period, mainly due to price erosion in the United States.
Changes to healthcare policy under President Donald Trump also look likely to affect companies like Sun, which generates 45 percent of its revenue from the U.S. market. Trump last month proposed imposing a ‘border tax’ on companies exporting to the United States.","Sun Pharma's profits drop as U.S. sales hit by pricing, supply issues"

The City of Johannesburg extended its condolences to Dikeletso’s family‚ but police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubela said the body has not yet been officially identified.
“A girl between 10 and 12 years was found in Mofolo along the river. We will confirm the age as soon as we get the birth certificate‚” he said.
Uncle Martin Dlomu said the family believed the body to belong to Dikeletso. “It’s so painful. It was the community that managed to find her. What can we do? God knows why it happened.”
Dikeletso’s father‚ Paul Dlomu‚ and other family and residents were among those searching for her. Before she was found they said they refused to give up and hoped to see her again.
“We still have faith that we will see her again‚ alive‚ in this world‚” Martin had said.
Dikeletso was swept off a muddy path and down a fierce steam on her way home from school on Thursday afternoon. According to her uncle she tried to jump the stream but fell in and was carried off in the current.
“Witnesses on the scene said there was a person who tried to grab her but the water was too strong for that person‚” Martin said.
Family members were knee-deep in water searching for Dikeletso in a canal locals call Kwezi Bridge. Earlier on Friday they had found a school bag believed to be hers.
“Her mother is at home now. She cannot take it. We are trying to calm each other as the situation is above our heads. People in the community‚ where my brother stays‚ they came yesterday and they helped us to pray together‚” Martin said.
Dikeletso lived with her family in Bramfischerville‚ Soweto. Her uncle described her as a bright girl with a bright future.
“She was a bright girl. She used to sing at church. She was so gifted really. We wanted to see her prosper in life. We expected a lot of things from her.
“We believe in God so much. Wherever she is the angels are looking after her. God himself is protecting her‚ wherever she is‚ because he’s the one who brought her into this world‚” he had said before she was found.
The City of Johannesburg said social workers have been dispatched to the scene to support the family.",'God knows why it happened‚' say family of Soweto teen found dead after storm

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had informed about their safe arrival on Sunday on her Twitter handle. She met the two Sufi clerics in Delhi on Monday.
Earlier On Saturday, it was reported that Syed Asif Nizami, head priest (Sajjadanashin) of Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia Dargah in Delhi, and his nephew Syed Nazim Nizami were in custody of Pakistan’s intelligence agency over their alleged links with Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM).

The development comes after the Pakistan government had conveyed to the Indian High Commission in Islamabad that the two clerics have been “traced and have reached Karachi”. Swaraj had earlier spoke to Pakistan PM’s adviser on foreign affairs Sartaj Aziz regarding the issue and sought his help in tracing the two.

https://dailynews.co.tz/news/manji-temporary-release-bid-hits-snag.aspx,"Judge Ama Munisi turned down the oral request that had been advanced by Manji’s lawyers; as such order would render nugatory the hearing of the main application seeking to challenge his detention.
Instead, the judge ordered expeditious hearing of the matter for the best interests of all the parties. She ordered the parties to appear before her next Monday for hearing of the application in question.
Manji, through his lawyers Alex Mgongolwa and Hudson Ndusyepo, has filed an application for “habeas corpus” with the claims that his detention is illegal. The businessman was arraigned before the Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in Dar es Salaam on February 16, this year, charged with one count of consumption of heroin, which is a narcotic drug. Principal Resident Magistrate Cyprian Mkeha granted him bail on condition of signed bond of 10m/-.
He was further required to secure one reliable surety who was also directed to sign a bond of a similar amount. After being granted bail, tired looking Manji was sent to hospital to receive treatment. But recently, his lawyers noticed that their client was still under restraint of immigration officers. They, therefore, filed an application for “habeas corpus” with the view that the immigration officers should surrender him to court and justify why they were still holding him.
When the matter came for hearing before the judge yesterday, Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Oswald Tibabyekomya showed up and entered appearance before the court.
The Deputy DPP informed the court that he was appearing for the Immigration Department, Police Force and the Attorney General and requested for time for him to file counter affidavit. Judge Munisi granted the request and ordered the DPP to file the affidavit in reply to that of Manji’s lawyers by next Monday.
It was at that point in time when the lawyers representing Manji sought an interim order. Meanwhile, the Kisutu Resident Magistrate’s Court in the city yesterday postponed to April 18, for another mention, Manji’s abuse of drugs’ trial, pending further investigations.
State Attorney Constantine Kakula, for the prosecution, informed Principal Resident Magistrate Cyprian Mkeha that they were still conducting investigations into the matter. During the session, Manji was not in attendance. His advocate Alex Mushumbuzi, reported to court that his client had been summoned by the High Court to attend another matter.
In the trial, Manji is alleged to have committed the offence on diverse dates between February 6 and 9, this year, at Upanga Sea View area within Ilala District in the city. Manji allegedly consumed heroin (diacetyl-morphine).
He is among persons implicated with the crime having been named by the Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner, Mr Paul Makonda. He was later directed to report to the Central Police Station for interrogation.
The businessman complied with the directives. There were reports that suggested later that during the interrogation, Manji fell sick and was taken to Muhimbili National Hospital where he was admitted until when he was brought to court for arraignment.",Manji temporary release bid hits snag

Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, was killed and Alok Madasani, another Indian of the same age, injured in a shooting by navy veteran Adam Purinton, who yelled “terrorist” and “get out of my country” before opening fire on them in Kansas last month.
The Kansas incident and other hate crime incidents against Indians and Indian-Americans since then has sent shock waves among the large Indian community in the US.
“As Governor of the State of Kansas, I would like to express my deep sadness and profound regret at the terrible act of violence committed against Srinu Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani. The people of Kansas share in my shock and horror. Words cannot express the sorrow that we feel for Srinu’s wife, Sunayana, and his family in Hyderabad,” Brownback wrote.
“In the time since Srinu’s death, we have reflected on his life, and the words I have heard most often to describe him are that he was courageous, and that he loved his family, and that he respected elders. We strive to live in Srinu’s example of courage and love and respect,” he wrote in the letter dated March 3, a copy of which has been seen by PTI.
Brownback wrote that Kansans has been awed by Sunayana’s grace and determination. Her indomitable spirit has moved the entire community and they pray for her comfort and peace in this time of grief.
Telling the Prime Minister that open arms of friendship are the very hallmarks of being a Kansan, the governor said Srinu embodied the essence of what it means to be a Kansan. “His friends describe him as charming, caring and loving. He brought with him his immense talents and education and passion. His story is similar to the thousands of Indian diaspora who have called Kansas home over generations,” he wrote.
“They have enjoyed tremendous success through their ingenuity, hard work, and determination. Our state has thrived because of their contributions,” Brownback wrote, adding that he would like to personally welcome Indians to his state.
“Before they moved here, Sunayana said: ‘Kansas was (the) instant choice.’ We are humbled that this was the case. I would like to personally welcome Indians to Kansas, and assure them that Kansas is a welcoming, hospitable place,” he said.
Noting that Sunayana also spoke about being without her family in Kansas, Brownback wrote in the letter that it is their solemn hope that the community in Olathe and all of Kansas may nourish and love her in the difficult months ahead.
“Acts of hate and intolerance have no place in Kansas. Since our founding, Kansas have fought against injustice and senseless hatred. We are recommitted daily to protecting our family, our neighbors, our guests. We find wisdom and peace in the Sanskrit mantra ‘Satyameva Jayate’,” Brownback said.

That’s especially the case now that Mercury, still retrograde, has moved into Aries. Even minor errors could lead to unexpected insights, often about issues that you thought you’d just have to live with.Usually, the Sun’s move into Taurus would lift your spirits and give your energy a welcome boost. While both of those are likely to happen, the odds are good you’ll be distracted by the range of complex obstacles you’re currently facing. No single one is that demanding, but each will offer its own unique challenges.If you’re experiencing ups and downs, both in terms of your feelings but also your enthusiasm for certain plans and even people, it’s no surprise. While, with your ruler Mercury retrograde and forthright Mars moving into Gemini, mood swings are inevitable, you’ll also have noticed that life’s more exciting than usual.Although Mercury went retrograde on the 9th, it’s just moved, still retrograde, to accent the structure of your life. Worrying as that sounds, the minor errors it kicks up will call your attention to arrangements that demand far too much from you, and give far too little in return.You don’t think of yourself as a control freak. Yet there are a number of situations about which you feel responsible, so watch carefully. Suddenly others are volunteering to help. While this would be a relief, you’re also concerned. Instead of worrying, talk things over, and in as great detail as possible.True, there’s a need to rethink plans. However, during this week of twists and turns, in both the actual circumstances you’re dealing with and the mood of others, your efforts are unlikely to achieve much. If you must reorganise things, regard what you do as tentative, if not a bit of an experiment.Nobody has a better understanding of the tensions that exist in even the most stable of relationships, personal or out in the world. Add the tensions triggered by the coming weeks’ complicated events, and there could be dramas. If so, that’s great. There’s no better way to clear the air.You’ve several decisions to make. While some are straightforward and involve practical matters, others are far more complicated and a few mean you’ll also have to get entangled with the ups and downs of certain emotional individuals. Tackle the easy ones first, especially since the others will require time and considerable patience.By no means are you secretive, about your plans, enthusiasms or passions. Yet once you’ve revealed your feelings to those you care about, you turn to other matters. Consequently, those who need frequent reminders they matter could feel hurt. Still, they need only ask and you’ll respond, and warmly.Ordinarily minor misunderstandings are best forgiven and forgotten. But because the issues in question link to more serious matters, you’re urged to talk these over. Once you’re actually discussing them, you’ll realise how crucial they are but, equally, how with only a brief conversation , they can be dealt with for good.The last thing you want to do is suggest that somebody is being dishonest. Yet judging by what you’re witnessing versus what the individual in question is saying, that’s the case. While, ordinarily, you’d avoid asking about such matters directly, not only is it best, it will clear up confusion instantly.Understandably, you were rather hoping one particular individual would live up to their promise to compensate you for your efforts or financial expenses. However, yet again, they’re apologising and saying something else came first.

http://thenationonlineng.net/2019-next-president/,"EVEN before President Muhammadu Buhari is through with his first term, and before he finds his footing or regains his composure in the middle of a debilitating illness, some politicians, opinion moulders and ethnic sycophants have suggested that he should run for a second term and they would back him. Few politicians inside and outside the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have summoned the courage and boldness to indicate their readiness to contest against him for the leadership of Nigeria. Their reluctance is not based on the president’s performance, which even some of his most ardent supporters have agreed is not stellar, nor is it based on their low self-esteem as politicians, mobilisers and thinkers, nor whether he can be beaten in the race or not, especially given his mounting vulnerabilities. They simply don’t want to draw his ire.
There are of course the hardy perennials like former Vice President Atiku Abubakar who would run for the presidency even if Aso Villa were locked in iron cage and the whole country declared with one voice that a vacancy did not exist. And there are the ambitious former Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, and the theatrical but eloquent Imo State governor, Rochas Okorocha, who both cast wary eyes on the presidency, obsessed with their desire to lead the country some day. There are many more like Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, Emir of Kano Lamido Sanusi Lamido, and former Jigawa State governor, Sule Lamido, fidgeting on the sidelines, standing on needle pricks, an emptiness gnawing at their inside in their eagerness to throw their hats in the presidential ring.
But on the whole, not many politicians will openly and recklessly announce their interest in the presidency for reasons ranging from Nigeria’s stifling political culture and ethnic struggles to a curious understanding of the zoning arrangement existing within and across ethnic and political lines. Indeed, for some politicians, except victory can be assured and they are promised there would be no recriminations for their hastiness, they would nurse their ambitions privately and brood over their chances in their closets. In the coming months, therefore — and no one is sure just how many months those coming months are — President Buhari can rest assured no topnotcher in his party would do anything rash. But that is only until the dam bursts. For he will inevitably have opposition within his party, and many top class politicians will finally dare his rage to throw their hats in the ring. The reasons for such brashness are not far-fetched.
President Buhari was the man needed to confront the Boko Haram menace with some vigour and purposefulness. He was also the ascetic needed to curb the mad disrespect contractors and politicians had for the country’s treasury. And he was the man needed to give some oomph to an economy that had been laid waste by his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan. He has had qualified success in the three objectives, but it was not because he attacked them with anything properly describable as a scientific or philosophical approach. The ‘national diseases’ were in any case already nearing the end of their tethers, like all pathogens in an epidemic, given the shameless and avaricious manner they attacked the country’s dignity. Anyone with modest skills and resolve could have had a fair chance against the ‘diseases’. President Buhari was that man, and the country must respect him for the role he has played.
Even if his illness had not hobbled him — and he will get increasingly languid in the months ahead principally on account of his age — his idea of leadership, economics, justice, religion and politics, among other things, has become so antiquated that it is not possible for him to prepare a nation of one million people for the 21st or 22nd century, not to talk of a complex, competing and distrustful nation of 180 million people. If zoning and grassroots support prove incapable of restricting him to a one-term presidency, his lack of vigour and the weakness and premature expiration of his ideas appear set to limit his 2019 ambitions. His supporters and those who see him as a steadying pair of hands in the affairs of Nigeria would want him for a second term, but he will be unable to campaign round one geopolitical zone, let alone round the whole country. Despite his supporters’ best sentiments, the reality is brutally and mercilessly circumscribing.
By next year, President Buhari will be forced to determine whether he wants to brave the odds or not. He will procrastinate as much as he can, but eventually he will have to grapple with the unsavoury decision of going ahead to contest for a second term despite the strain on him, or calling it quits. He will probably want to anoint a successor, as most of his predecessors had done to the country’s dismay and injury. But more and more, given the damage the constricting nature of his presidency has engendered, even that luxury of anointing someone may elude him. Indeed, if he does not now seize the initiative to make amends for the unfairness and parochialism his government has instituted, if he does not immediately begin to assemble a pan-Nigerian and technocratic group whose ideas and world view transcend the country’s ethnic and religious divides, circumstances and agile politicians may seize the initiative from him. The succession war would as a result be brutal, intense and fratricidal, if not in the final analysis even regicidal.
Nature designed the Buhari presidency for a one-term reign. In fact since 1999, in order for the country to regain its balance and bearing, nature had designed every presidency thus far as a one-term presidency. Ex-president Olusegun forced the hands of nature and abused its providential gift by seeking a second term. The consequences are still evident. Former president Umaru Yar’Adua was a decent man by every yardstick, but he was no match for the complexities and rigour the modern era demanded. He would also have forced nature’s hands had nature itself not anticipated and thwarted him. Dr Jonathan’s presidency gave the country assurance that political calculations and nature itself offer guarantees and universal access to the presidency. Beyond that, the Jonathan presidency was of little use. There is nothing in the Buhari presidency to indicate its tenure can be lengthened. And just in case anyone, whether cabal or not, should think otherwise, nature itself has fortuitously introduced its own irrepressible guarantees through the president’s age and physiological challenges.
Since 1999, there has not been one presidency that gave hope of a presidential lodge filled with thinkers and nationalists. Chief Obasanjo was self-important and narcissistic; Mallam Yar’Adua was impressionable and lethargic; Dr Jonathan was hesitant and provincial; and now President Buhari is unmistakeably distracted and insular. The consequences were terrifyingly real: the instability and effete foundation that distorted and convulsed the parliament under Chief Obasanjo; the dithering, machinations and cabalistic tendencies that undermined the presidency under Mallam Yar’Adua; the sybaritic and directionless leadership that stupefied Dr Jonathan’s presidency and political party; and the slow, parochial and embarrassingly lopsided appointments that have virtually negated President Buhari’s otherwise fine attributes and interventionist presidency.
It is too early to determine who will or should contest for the presidency in 2019. Indeed, it is even unnecessary to entertain such speculations. What is more important is to determine who the next president will be and what he must do to restore the country to the path of sanity, stability, growth and inclusiveness. The next president will of course have to campaign vigorously round the country, not once, not twice. He must be full of vigour and brimful with ideas. He must be exposed, well travelled and educated. If he wants to be deeply religious, whether Christian or Muslim, the electorate should compel him to opt for clerical duties and leave the presidency for someone with enough joie de vivre, someone whose love of life and the arts instantly transforms him into a philosopher of sorts, someone not averse to modernity, connoisseurship and their trappings of delicate soirees and occasional but subtly managed glances at one or more décolletage. No, of course, Chief Obasanjo’s presidency was gross and undisciplined, Dr Jonathan’s presidency was coarse and bohemian, and Malam Yar’Adua’s and Buhari’s presidencies were boring, pretentious and artificial.
More importantly, 2019 should produce a president who has something concrete to give, something deep, profound and fundamental, something the rest of the country can learn from and recount to future generations. Nobody in the mould of Nigeria’s presidents since 1999 fits that bill. The next president must be able to inspire the entirely ludicrous National Assembly whose buffooneries appear to get worse as the theatrical Bukola Saraki and his zany, Dino Melaye, target the country’s midriff rather than its cortex. The next president must really and evidently have an original, discernible and scientific idea of how Nigeria should be restructured and ruled. If that aspiring president has not read Deng Xiaoping, Winston Churchill, Konrad Adenauer, Shigeru Yoshida, Charles de Gaulle, Napoleon Bonaparte, Nelson Mandela, Ben Gurion and Moshe Dayan, Gamel Abdel Nasser, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, and Julius and Augustus Caesar, he has no business offering himself for the presidency of Nigeria.
In addition, it would be shocking and distressing if that aspirant is unable to prove he has repeatedly immersed himself in the histories of the transatlantic slave trade, colonialism in Africa, Oyo/Benin/Kanem-Bornu Empires, Sokoto Caliphate, the many Kingdoms in the central and southern parts of Nigeria, and the biographies of first generation Nigerian leaders like Nnamdi Azikwe, Obafemi Awolowo, Ahmadu Bello, among others. If the aspirant has not read all the books mentioned above, what on earth would he know about leadership, where Nigeria got it wrong, and where the country should be headed? How could he form the right perspectives nationally and internationally? Indeed, what would he know about the role and importance of the legislature and judiciary beyond the reprehensible circus being enacted by lawmakers in Abuja and the states?
Chief Obasanjo was not prepared for civil leadership; nor were his successors, Mallam Yar’Adua, Dr Jonathan, and President Buhari. They undoubtedly made modest contributions to Nigeria, but they gave nothing visionary, substantial or futuristic. The next president must be put to the test to determine what he knows, what his thoughts are, how his mind works, what the country must do, and where it should go. For about 18 years, the country adopted the zoning nonsense and ethnic and religious considerations to elect their presidents. It is time to put a halt to a method that is ruining the country and destroying the future of its peoples. Those nonsensical considerations have even reached such an offensive point that some people now insist President Buhari must complete eight years in office or the region he hails from must complete the remaining four years should he decline to run again.
Despite the best efforts of past leaders, most of whom were not even fit to rule local governments, Nigeria has become more disunited. Repeated ethnic clashes and religious conflicts offer proof. Rather than bury their heads in the sand, Nigerians should bravely and intelligently confront the maladies that afflict their awkward and ungainly federation. One of such maladies is electing thoughtless leaders simply because of their tribes or religions, and installing unserious and comical lawmakers in parliament because of what they stand for in their valueless communities. In 2019, the country must unite to put an end to the madness. Nigeria needs a great legislature and a thinking and just president. No one should commit the mistake of campaigning for the destruction of the legislature, judiciary or executive. Instead, the right people who would ennoble these institutions should be voted into office.
In 2014, this columnist wrote effusively, perhaps more than most people, to support the candidacy of President Buhari. He won, and he has done a few commendable things. In 2019, this column will not in any circumstance lend support to President Buhari should he choose to run. It is out of the question, regardless of whether he runs and wins or not. It is time to seek out a great, deep and thoughtful nationalist; someone not encumbered by tribe, religion or class; someone who knows what to do with the arts, sciences and education as a whole; someone who understands where the country feels the pain and what balm to apply; someone who understands how to repair the damage done to the legislature and the judiciary; someone who thinks high and lofty. Anything other than pursuing this noble enterprise is treason against the country.",2019: The next president

More than 160 000 pensioners have so far been registered under the National Social Security Authority (NSSA) biometric registration programme aimed at curbing benefit fraud. Biometric registration, which involves capturing of one’s unique physical attributes such as fingerprints, DNA, iris and retina pattern, replaces the need for a life certificate.
Under the previous regime, pensioners were required to present themselves before an officer for vetting to access services. With the majority of pensioners living far from towns, the process was strenuous. Under the new system, getting a life certificate will not require physical presence.
Speaking after launching the Makonde Senator’s Sports Tournament in Chinhoyi at the weekend, Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Prisca Mupfumira said NSSA’s outreach programmes have been effective.
“The biometric registration is ongoing,” she said. “We have started an outreach into the rural areas to get the people to register and also explain to them the benefits.
“We are doing it so that pensioners who get the benefits are genuine. The biometric process will help extensively.”
The process, she said, ensured direct consumer contact, so that those who have not claimed their benefits out of ignorance were assisted.
A number of options to make it easier for pensioners to access their money, including use of the National Building Society and mobile platforms were being explored. Biometric registration is also for those who have attained pensionable age, but the benefits cease as soon as the pensioner dies.
However, some families continued benefiting even after the death of the pensioner.
“We want to ensure that NSSA beneficiaries can access their money wherever they are,” said Minister Mupfumira. “They do not have to travel to NSSA offices.”",160 000 pensioners on NSSA biometric system

THE Europe-Africa-Caribbean-Pacific Liaison Committee (COLEACP) will, at the end of this month, launch the Zimbabwe edition of the Fit for Market programme which seeks to improve horticulture producers’ access to domestic and international markets.
The programme, managed by COLEACP, is part of the intra-ACP indicative programme (2014-2020) for co-operation between the European Union (EU) and the ACP countries.
The budget for the five-year programme is €25 million (about $27 million), including €20 million (about $22 million) from the European Development Fund (EDF).
COLEACP Regional Co-ordinator of Operations, Ms Yessie Meyer, said on the sidelines of the Fruit Logistica Expo recently held in Berlin, Germany, that the Zimbabwe edition of the Fit for Market programme will be launched in Harare on May 30, 2017. “The programme aims at assisting the growth of enterprises, by improving their access to domestic and international markets, while at the same time strengthening the horticultural value chain through capacity building,” said Ms Meyer.
The programme will assist producers and exporters to implement good agricultural practices such as global gap and other private standards, sustainable environmental management practices as well as facilitate access to finance, among other things.
The Fit for Market programme also seeks to strengthen the horticultural value chain through capacity building. “Our model is to impart technical expertise to locals so that they can be empowered to continue with the programme in a sustainable framework,” added Ms Meyer.

He spoke to Brian Okinda on how farmers can use technology to better their yields
What are the main challenges bedevilling smallholder farmers and how can they be overcome?
Smallholder farmers face many issues that include battling diseases, dealing with drought and other effects of climate change, locating advice on product pricing and local markets, facing water and electricity shortages and working long hours, leaving little time for non-farming tasks.
But technology can lessen this burden by helping farmers’ access crucial knowledge on livestock and crops. It can help them source for inputs or battle a disease without leaving their farms or spending any money.
How is technology especially that based on mobile phone, central in eliminating challenges farmers in Kenya are facing?
The most successful services use technology to match vital needs with improved speed and efficiency. Mobile technology is an important way for us to deliver vital agricultural information to farmers that can no longer wait for the extension worker’s next visit.
Through the mobile phone, they do not have the time to travel long distances to get diagnostic information.
How do you rate information and communication technology use in the agriculture sector in Kenya?
Exciting! There’s such a vibrant entrepreneurial community building in Kenya, and a lot of attention is increasingly being focused on the agriculture sector.
However, I believe there is still too much focus on top down approaches and a belief that the agricultural communities we are working with just need to be told what to do.
We must do things differently. We believe farmers have the deep knowledge most relevant to help each other and what they need is a platform to connect in a way that is convenient and cost-effective.
Do you think the Kenyan farmer is ready for a mobile phone agricultural revolution?
Absolutely. Farmers in Kenya are incredibly smart and motivated.
One of the reasons WeFarm has managed to attract so many users in relatively short span of time is that farmers are hungry for information about ways they can improve their farms, produce higher yields, diversify their output and find low-cost solutions to their everyday farming problems.
They understand mobile services are there to help with greater ease and efficiency.
WeFarm is a mobile phone technology through which farmers share peer-to-peer extension services? Explain how the system works?
How WeFarm works is simple. Farmer Joseph is out one day and realises his tea farm has been attacked by a pest he has never seen before. So, he sends a free SMS to the WeFarm number.
WeFarm then shares Joseph’s question with other farmers around the world who answer it. His problem is solved.
That’s what WeFarm is, it’s simply a way to receive valuable information to help you increase productivity on your farm.
What do you tell farmers who still believe in the old way of doing things when it comes to access to extension services, marketing, among others?
Technology does not exist to replace extension workers, or the old way of doing things, instead it provides a valuable, complimentary service that enables the modern farmers to access the information they need, whenever they need it.",Why the modern farmer must embrace mobile technology

Officials said services would soon be made available for passengers. J S Sahota, General Manager, BSNL Telecom District, Chandigarh said, “Installation of Wi-Fi services at the airport has already been done. Few days ago, we conducted a trial run for two days. We are now hoping to start the services for the passengers very soon.”
He added that due to a technical problem in the server, the Wi-Fi services are not working at the airport and process is on to fix the problem.
Wi-FI services is yet to be introduced at the new terminal of the airport, which was inaugurated in 2015. The BSNL has been saying repeatedly that services would begin soon. But, nothing has been done so far.
At the airport, passengers have demanded that services should be started. They said the airport authority should provide all the services as they have also imposed additional tax on the passengers recently.
From May 1, Airport Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) of India had decided to levy user development fee (UDF) on the outgoing passengers at the airport. With the introduction of UDF, a passenger, taking the Chandigarh-Delhi flight, will have to pay at least Rs 250 extra.
BSNL officials had earlier said the installation got delayed owing to the late arrival of equipment. According to BSNL, passengers would be provided free access for the first 20 minutes and then those wanting to use it further, would be provided an option to recharge it online to continue its usage.

GMOA Assistant Secretary Nalinda Herath told a news conference that they would not day their trade union action was until the government accedes to their demands on the SAITM issue.
“This strike will only be successful when we win this battle. Minister Rajitha Senaratne has said the government will take tough action against the striking doctors. We will be forced to toughen our stance if he does so,” he said.
Dr. Herath rejected allegations made by the minister that the doctors would be held responsible if anything untoward happens in the fight against dengue and said government doctors would continue treating dengue patients considering it as an emergency situation.
Meanwhile, GMOA Media Spokesman Samantha Ananda said the final phase of the battle against SAITM has now arrived and that the government should resolve this matter without further delay.
He said they had made five suggestions which the government could easily implement in resolving this matter.
“According to their suggestions, the Health Minister should gazette the minimum standards of medical education and the Higher Education Minister should inform the courts that SAITM does not have the compliance certificate given by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). The government should stop SAITM from enrolling new students,” Dr. Ananda said.

Moscow (AFP)
The family of Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who saved thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II before disappearing under Soviet rule, are suing Russia's security service for access to its files, their lawyer said Thursday.
""The relatives of Wallenberg filed the lawsuit at the Meshchansky court in the Russian capital on Wednesday,"" their lawyer Ivan Pavlov told AFP.
The Wallenberg family ""wants to force the FSB (the successor to the KGB) to give it access to the originals of the documents"" that concern Wallenberg's fate, Pavlov said.
He said that Wallenberg's relatives have made many attempts to gain access to the FSB archives dating back to the Soviet era. These were either rejected or the documents they received were incomplete, Pavlov said.
""This case isn't just about the possibility of restoring the memory of a remarkable person. It is also yet another attempt to fight the inacessibility of the FSB archives,"" the lawyer said.
As a special envoy in Nazi-controlled Hungary, Wallenberg issued Swedish identity papers to tens of thousands of Jews, allowing them to flee Nazi-occupied Hungary and likely death.
But when the Soviets entered Budapest months before the war ended, they summoned Wallenberg to their headquarters in January 1945, after which he disappeared, aged 32.
In 1957, the Soviet Union released a document saying Wallenberg had been jailed in the Lubyanka prison, the notorious building where the KGB security services were headquartered, and that he died of heart failure on July 17, 1947.
But his family refused to accept that version of events, and for decades have been trying to establish what happened to him.
In 2000 the head of a Russian investigative commission conceded Wallenberg had been shot and killed by KGB agents in Lubyanka in 1947 for political reasons, but declined to be more specific or to cite hard evidence.
Last year Sweden officially declared Wallenberg dead, but his body has never been returned to his family.

Livingstone Marufu
According to the RBZ Governor Dr John Mangudya, about US$200 million was locked up in cash barons’ hands who are hoarding money while part of it was externalised.
The country has long been facing cash shortages as about US$600 million is needed to meet cash demands.
The central bank is encouraging the transacting public to use plastic money and mobile money transfers to ease the high demand for cash.
So far $175 million worth of bond notes have been injected into the economy to incentivise exporters and ease cash shortages.
Dr Mangudya said: “We have imported over US$400 million in the past seven months to ease the cash shortages. We will continue importing between US$15 million and US$20 million per week.
“But lack of discipline (which include cash hoarding, capital flight and high rates) in the local economy is dampening our efforts to oil the market and turn around the economy.”
He explained that importing cash was not an overnight process as banks were subjected to Customer Due Diligence (CDD) by their correspondent banks abroad. A correspondent bank is a financial institution that provides services on behalf of another.
Dr Mangudya dismissed claims that bond notes and US Dollar notes were shipped out of the country, adding that there was more cash flowing in the informal sector.
“We still have a lot of physical money but it’s in the informal economy. Cash is not circulating and this is a cause for concern. This is what is called rent seeking behaviour which is not a normal practice,” he said.
“Due to this rent-seeking behaviour people want to do arbitrary transactions where they cash in on the shortage of forex. We call for behaviour change and fiscal discipline.
“If banks are doing it, we call it abuse of office and if it’s done by business or traders its poor corporate governance.
‘‘We will compel the banks using the Bank Use and Promotion Act.”
RBZ is pushing for fiscal consolidation and improving the investment climate and promotion of free banking to promote high levels of production.
There has been growing for the setting up of a Commercial Crimes Court, which awaits Cabinet approval, to deal with corruption and illicit financial flows.",‘US$200m in cash barons’ hands’

So it may have been jarring for some to hear him expressing deep support for human rights, democracy and the rule of law in an address last month to a large group of United States and European lawmakers who came for a conference to Minsk, the country’s tidy, but utterly uniform, capital.
For Mr. Lukashenko, however, the performance was old hat.
Over two decades, he has perfected the art of playing Russia and the West against each other. Belarus has been both an indispensable ally and ward of the Kremlin, depending on Russian subsidies to keep its economy afloat, and an important buffer for the West against the Kremlin’s growing military aggressiveness.

GOVERNMENT has released K700,000 out of the K1.4 million Constituency Development Fund (CDF) to Manyinga.
Manyinga Member of Parliament Robert Lihefu confirmed the development in an interview with the Daily Nation yesterday.
Mr Lihefu said the funds would be used to complete all stalled projects in the constituency that were being undertaken using CDF before embarking on new ones.
He said part of the funds have been allocated towards the rehabilitation of the Chifuwe-Choongo road which leads to a farming bloc, adding that the road once done will enable farmers to easily access the market.
“And part of the funds will go towards the construction of additional classroom blocks at various schools in the area to help increase class accommodation,” Mr Lihefu said.
He also said Manyinga District Council has embarked on a project to build a new market using part of the Local Government equalisation funds and his office has allocated funds to build an ablution block for the new market
He said his office has put in place stringent measures to ensure that the funds are not misapplied but channelled towards the implementation of development projects that will benefit the people in the district.","Manyinga lands K700,000 CDF"

Undoubtedly, this is the reason why the public has been ‘on her case’ over the rate at which she gives birth.

https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bihar-congress-leaders-seek-state-chief-ashok-choudharys-removal-4801714/,"NEARLY THREE weeks after the JD(U)-RJD-Congress grand alliance collapsed in Bihar, state Congress chief Ashok Choudhary appears to be in trouble as senior Congress leaders have approached the high command seeking his removal and putting in place an action plan to revitalise the party.
Sources said the fear of some Congress MLAs switching sides to the JD(U) is still worrying the party.
Sources said former Lok Sabha MP Akhilesh Prasad Singh, who joined the Congress from the RJD in 2010, is among the frontrunners for the post of PCC chief in the event of replacement of Choudhary, who many in the party believe was close to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. With Kumar parting ways, Choudhary’s critics say his continuance would not help in strengthening the Congress in Bihar.
The Congress high command had last week rushed senior leaders Jyotiraditya Scindia and Jai Prakash Agarwal to Patna to meet the party’s MLAs amid fears that some of them could desert the party. Scindia and Agarwal held a meeting of the Congress legislature party in the presence of Choudhary and CLP leader Sadanand Singh and averted an immediate split in the CLP.
A section of the party is also arguing that a Brahmin leader should be appointed as the state Congress president.
Sources said several leaders broached the topic of appointment of a new PCC chief with the emissaries sent by the high command.
Talking to The Indian Express, Aggarwal, however, said their job was only to conduct a meeting of the CLP which they did. “There was no talk about leadership change. That was not our mandate,” he said. The Congress has 27 MLAs in Bihar.",Bihar Congress leaders seek state chief Ashok Choudhary’s removal

The winner, who collected his winnings two days later, said he only spent RM50 for 25 sets of Lucky Pick numbers for only one draw to win the jackpot.
""I started playing Sports Toto games four years ago, but I only bet on my car plate numbers and I have not won anything.
""On Wednesday evening, I was stuck in a traffic jam while I was on my way to dinner. So when I decided to take a detour, I spotted a Sports Toto outlet and I thought I should try my luck since all my friends had been talking about the largest Toto jackpot recently.
""It was my first time playing the Lotto game, so I took out RM50 and told the sales person that I wanted to buy RM50 Lucky Pick on Grand Toto 6/63,"" he told Sports Toto.
The winner said he did not check the result on that night and he was alerted by his friends the next morning that someone from Penang won the jackpot.
""I didn't take note of my friend's alert and continued my daily tasks. I went for my breakfast and started working at home.
""Suddenly the jackpot alert crossed my mind and I started checking through the tickets. When I saw a ticket matched the last two numbers of the result, which were 52 and 53, I was pretty sure that I'd won.
""So I told my younger brother to check the rest of the numbers for me and I was right. I won the jackpot. We were so excited that we could not stop screaming and running around the house,"" he said.

http://www.newsday.co.zw/2017/10/mbare-man-jailed-6-years-stealing-network-cables/,"A 21-YEAR-OLD Mbare man has been slapped with a six-year prison term by a Harare magistrate after he was convicted of stealing 30kg of communication drop live cables worth $3 000.
BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE
Danmore Mutyavaviri was convicted by magistrate Nomsa Sabarauta, who ruled that offences of stealing copper network live cables were soaring and a six-year jail term without suspension of sentence would deter other would-be offenders.
However, Mutyavaviri had denied the charge saying he was only assisting his colleague, who fled the scene, to carry the load not knowing that he was stealing the cables.
But a witness, George Mutemachani, had told court that he saw Mutyavaviri and his accomplice, who is still at large, pulling the cables from a distance.
The court heard that on September 11 this year Mutyavaviri and his accomplice, Godknows Mutaurwa, cut and bundled communication drop live cables.
An alert security company guard Mutemachani saw Mutyavaviri and Mutaurwa pulling the cables and he informed his senior who in turn phoned Borrowdale police.
Borrowdale police officers rushed to the scene where they managed to arrest Mutyavaviri and recovered 30kg of communications drop cables, but his accomplice Mutaurwa managed to escape.

 Speaking at the 43rd batch of the Retirement Benefit Bond Certificate Presentation Ceremony in Lagos, the Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Benson Oke Akintola, who represented the Governor, said the administration is poised to touch every aspect of life.

Use your pension for your basic needs, and make sure you eat well and in moderation.”
 She noted that the current economic challenges have affected the ability of youths to gain employment. In essence, many youths who should be taking care of themselves and their parents are still dependent on them.

 Onanuga also used the medium to educate the retirees, who needed clarifications on different pension related subjects ranging from apportionment of benefits emanating from service in other states, to computation of lump sum and pension received under the CPS dispensation.
 In appreciation, Adedokun, Michael Oyeleye, a physically impaired retiree amongst others that spoke, said prayed for God to continue to guide and guard Ambode and his team.

https://thesunnewspaper.cm/top-u-s-senators-express-worry-cameroon/,"Two prominent senators of the United States congress; Senate minority leader, Charles E. Schumer (D) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D) have expressed concern regarding the worsening situation in Cameroon.
The two senators expressed their support of a unified Cameroon based on both equality amongst all language and ethnic groups and mutual respect and urged the US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson and US Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Nikki Haley to urge the US government to convey this position to the Cameroon government and to the Cameroonian community in the United States of America.
In the latter to Rex Tillerson and Nikki Haley dated November 1, 2017, the senators expressed worries over the reported deaths during the September 22 and October 1 demonstrations in the North West and South West regions of the country.
“We are concerned about the disturbing State Department and Amnesty International reports of live ammunition being used to disperse protests, mass arrests, increasing harsh crackdowns on freedoms of the press, severe restrictions on the movement of people living in predominantly Anglophone areas, and internet blackouts imposed by the government targeting the country’s English-speaking minority”, the letter reads in parts.
The Senators further expressed concerns as Cameroon is already being tested by Boko Haram activity in the North, and by tens of thousands of refugees flowing across the border from Central African Republic in the east.
“According to Amnesty International and subsequent media reports by CNN”, the letter furthered, “harsh tactics by state security forces, including allaged torture and extrajudicial killings, have occurred. It is our worry that such harsh actions are likely to further drive radicalization and anti-government sentiment in all affected regions, and undermine the intended impact of significant U.S. security assistance. We are further concerned that a failure to depolarize the current situation will result in larger challenges that devolve into a crisis that threatens regional stability, U.S. interests in Cameroon, and the lives of American citizens currently living and working there”, the letter concluded.",Top U.S. senators express worry over Cameroon

https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/no-effort-made-control-air-pollution,"Kathmandu, November 19
Although air quality monitoring began in the country 15 years ago, the government has so far made no effort to control air pollution.
According to the Department of Environment, analysers are needed for accurate and comparative analysis of air quality data. However, neither the Ministry of Population and Environment nor the department has any post for statistical analysers.
Senior Divisional Chemist at the Department of Environment Shankar Prasad Paudel admitted that after setting up air quality monitoring stations in Kathmandu Valley, the government has only been collecting air quality data and no efforts have been made to control air pollution.
The government had resumed air quality monitoring in the Kathmandu Valley by installing a station at Ratnapark in August last year, seven years after previous monitoring stations were closed. Though air quality monitoring in Nepal began in 2002, no stations were operational since 2009.
The Danish government had installed seven air quality stations in the Valley in 2002. Five of these stations were set up in Machchegaun, Kirtipur, Patan, Putalisadak, and Bhaktapur each, and two in Thamel.
According to the Department of Environment, the stations have been sending data regularly to the central sever since that began operation.
The stations measured dust particles, especially particulate matter (PM 10) and PM 2.5 in the air, levels of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and ozone in the atmosphere.
After the stations were handed over to the government in 2008, the government entrusted Environment and Public Health Organisation with operating them. However, a misunderstanding between the government and ENPHO led to closure of the stations in 2009.
According to the department, six additional stations will be installed in Khumaltar, Machchhegaun, Teku, Bhaktapur, Chandragiri and Kapan or Maharajgunj.
The department is in the process of installing 56 stations throughout the country with the help of International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development and Kathmandu Sustainable Urban Transport Project.
According to the Environment Performance Index 2016 that quantifies the environmental performance of state’s policies, Nepal ranks 149 among 180 countries, and 177 in air quality.
While cities around the world, including neighboring countries, have taken stringent actions to improve air quality, Nepal has yet to do so.",No effort being made to control air pollution

The facility —name@rajasthan.bharat (in Devanagari script) — will lead to millions of new users who are not comfortable with English e-mail ids, officials said.
“During Digifest Kota in August 2017, chief minister Vasundhara Raje had shown the intent to have a vernacular e-mail service for the residents who are not fluent in English as she felt that language should not be a hindrance for anybody using emails or electronic communication. Hence, the vernacular e-mail, in Hindi, was launched on December 3. Rajasthan is the first, and currently the only state, to have a vernacular e-mail,” principal secretary, department of information technology and communications, Akhil Arora, told HT.
The first e-mail id that was created was that of the chief minister, Vasundhara@rajasthan.bharat (in Devnagari). All the government personnel in the state will soon have an email id in Hindi too.
The project has been implemented by the state IT department with partnership in form of in-sourcing with private IT companies, a senior official said. A dedicated team of 10 experts from the state IT department worked for three months on the project. Apart from people who use Hindi keyboard, the email also works for those who use English keyboard. Even the Japanese who like to work in their own language don’t have a linguistic email id, the official said.
“The initiative will ensure maximum participation of people towards e-governance and also that maximum facilities are available in vernacular language. This e-mail is small part of the bigger picture ‘Rajasthan DigiKit’ which has an enrollment of more than one crore people,” he said.
In December 2016, state-run BSNL had launched e-mail address service in eight Indian languages for its broadband users by launching a ‘DataMail’ service.
However, unlike BSNL, the Hindi email offered by Rajasthan government is for all the Internet users.
As per TRAI, total Internet subscribers in India are just about 30 per cent of the country’s population. So, about 70 percent of population is not having access to the Internet and most of these belong to rural India.
As per official data compiled in 2016, Hindi is spoken by 544 million people in India making it the most spoken language.

https://www.dailymirror.lk/Medicine/Getting-a-new-lease-of-life/308-142723,"Kidney transplantation is the optimum treatment for end-stage kidney failure. Although the preparation and progress to a kidney transplant involves a complex series of events, the end result is a normal functioning kidney and a new lease of life.   
 
What they do 
Kidneys are essential for life. Humans usually have two kidneys placed in the retroperitoneum (behind the intestines) which are involved in numerous essential functions which include:   

clearance of toxins from the body via urine   
maintaining water balance   
contributing to the control of 

blood pressure   

production of certain hormones etc.   

What causes kidneys to fail?
There are two types of kidney failure; acute (sudden and often reversible) and chronic (long-standing and often irreversible).   
 
Acute kidney failure is often caused by conditions such as infections, use of toxic drugs and severe dehydration. It starts suddenly and progresses rapidly. However, with early identification and proper treatment, this condition is often completely reversible.   Chronic kidney failure has a slower progression often causing gradual deterioration of the kidneys over several years. The commonest reasons for chronic kidney 
failure are:   
 

 

 diabetes   
 hypertension   
 kidney stones and repeated infections   
 long-term use of toxic medications   
 immunological diseases (where the body starts producing antibodies that harm one’s own kidneys) etc.   

What is end-stage kidney failure?
Chronic kidney failure progresses slowly. In the initial stages, it can be controlled with medication. End-stage kidney failure is when chronic kidney failure has progressed to the extreme to cause complete kidney failure where medical treatment is inadequate.   
 
End-stage kidney failure requires renal replacement therapy. Renal replacement therapy is where the functions of the kidneys are performed artificially by way of dialysis or transplantation of a new kidney.   
 
Renal transplantation is the best long-term treatment for end-stage kidney failure which gives the longest chance of survival and best quality of life.   
 
 
Transplant
Donor kidneys can be from live donors or deceased (dead) donors. Live donor kidneys give the best outcomes by way of long term survival. Donating a single kidney is perfectly safe for a healthy person. However, live donors are not always easy to find. The alternative is a deceased donor. These are patients who suffer from ‘brain death’ in hospitals following accidents, strokes etc.   
 

 
 
How to select a suitable kidney?
The first thing is to make sure that the potential donor is compatible with the recipient. There are two types of compatibility tests carried out in hospital.   
The first basic compatibility is for the 
blood group.   
 
The second stage of compatibility testing is for tissue antigens called Human Leucocyte Antigens (HLA) and crossmatch. The HLA matching will determine the exact compatibility of the donor and the recipient. The better the match, better the outcome!   
 
Can anyone be a donor?
Voluntary living donors are extensively checked and screened prior to a transplant. A potential donor should be completely healthy without any evidence of on-going disease.   
Under the Sri Lankan law, all male donors should be over 25 years of age and all female donors should be over 30 years of age although this may be subject to individual consideration in exceptional cases such as a parent donating to a child. 
 
 
Can anyone have a transplant?
Almost anyone can have a transplant. Before the intended transplant, the hospital will carry out specific tests to determine fitness for surgery. This will include a few tests including a chest X-ray, ECG and Echocardiogram to determine the fitness of the heart.   
 
 
Legal aspects 
A potential donor and recipient will initially face an ethical committee examination.   
Then the donor’s and patient’s reports are submitted to the Ministry of Health where an independent inquiry into the transplant is conducted to ensure the necessary legal documents are in place. Next, the Director General of Health Services in the Ministry of Health will formally authorize the transplant. 
Individual authorization from the Ministry of Health for each transplant is a pre-requisite. Once those authorization documents are received by the hospital, the medical team will finalize the date for the transplant.   
 
 
Admittance 
The majority of patients for transplants are admitted to the hospital either the day before or the morning of the transplant. Some basic tests are repeated and the patient will have a preliminary dialysis before the transplant.   
 
 
After admission
To ensure the patient is ready for the operation, several things will be done. Hair on the chest and abdomen will be shaved. The patient also undergoes a bath with antiseptic soap/solution before the operation.   
 
The surgery will be carried out under general anaesthesia. Therefore, the patient will fast for approximately 6 hours before the operation. 
 
 
Process 
The transplant is performed in the operating theatre. In a live donor transplant, both the donor and the patient will be operated on at the same time. In the instance of a deceased donor transplant, the donor kidney may be brought from the same or a different hospital.   
 
The new kidney is placed in the lower abdomen usually on the right side.   
During the transplant, the patient will have a catheter inserted to his/her bladder. This catheter will allow urine to be collected without the patient having to get up and empty the bladder.   
 
 
Duration 
The transplant operation generally takes approximately 3-4 hours. However, in rare instances, where there is some complexity, the operation may be prolonged.   
 
 
After surgery
After the surgery, the patient will be taken to the intensive care unit. The patient will usually remain in the ICU for 24-48 hours.   
 
 
Basic precautions 

 Limit the number of visitors   
Always wear a face mask   
Avoid infection transmission – use of antiseptics, hand washing, face mask   
 Eat home cooked meals   
Take all medications given by the hospital

https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/all-you-need-is-the-right-acronym/article22267392.ece,"Politics is often a play of words, in America as much as in India. A news report which said the Trump administration had asked the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to avoid using words such as diversity, entitlement and evidence-based. in documents for next year’s budget stirred a controversy recently. The administration responded by saying that the report is a “mischaracterisation” of the budget discussions.But another contest this week clearly left the Republicans at a loss of words — or rather with a problem of plenty. The Democrats forced them to rename the much-hyped tax code legislation to “An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018.” Mr. Trump had started with the wish to name the new law the “Cut Cut Cut” Act. It was first voted in the House of Representatives as “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, but Senate Democrats protested as the title was not consistent with a legislative rule that the Republicans invoked to speed up the voting process at the cost of deliberations. The Bill was voted in the House for a second time, with the new name.Legislative titles can often be misleading. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) that the U.S. Supreme Court declared unconditional in 2015 had prohibited married same-sex couples from collecting federal benefits. ‘Religious liberty’ is another concept that is loosely thrown around in legislative drafts, often to restrict gay rights.American lawmakers also search for Bill titles that make for appealing acronyms. Early this year, Representative Mike Quigley introduced the “Covfefe” Act — or Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically for Engagement. Covfefe was a typo in a tweet by Mr. Trump. The Covfefe Bill seeks to amend the Presidential Records Act to include the term “social media” as documentary material, ensuring additional preservation of presidential communication and statements.The Covfefe Bill raises a valid concern but it may find a tough challenger in the OOPS Act for its silly title. “Oppose Oversharing by Presidents Act” was introduced by a Democratic lawmaker when reports said Donald Trump shared “highly classified” intelligence with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and former Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in May.BOSS ACT — Better Oversight of Secondary Sales and Accountability in Concert Ticketing — introduced in 2016 sought to bring transparency in ticket pricing and sales, after a Bruce Springsteen concert brought these concerns to the front. Mr. Springsteen goes by the moniker Boss. On a more serious note, the pending DREAM or Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, seeks to protect illegal residents who arrived in America as children. They are now called Dreamers, thanks to the Bill title.The Pension And Social Security Measuring Equivalence Permanent Linking of Everyone’s Actual Savings Environment (PASS ME PLEASE) Act, which merely sought to correct a typo on Page 346 of the tax code, riled Congressman Mike Honda so much that he introduced the Accountability and Congressional Responsibility On Naming Your Motions (ACRONYM) Act in 2015. It sought to prohibit the addition of words to the title of a Bill just to create an acronym. Mr. Honda lost in the 2016 Democratic primary to Ro Khanna and is no longer in the House, leaving the Bill an orphan.Varghese K. George works for  The Hindu

http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/12/man-pregnant-wife-2-children-die-lagos-fire/,"Tragedy struck yesterday in Bariga area of Lagos after an owner of a pharmaceutical shop, Mr. Kenneth Eze, his pregnant wife and two children were burnt to death in a fire that engulfed their bungalow building.
The exact cause of the inferno, which occurred at about 2a.m. could not be ascertained. But some residents of Buriamoh street stated that it was caused by power upsurge while others claimed that it was by candlelight.
The Ezes, according to residents ,were last seen at about 10.30p.m. Monday.
A woman, who gave her name as Mama Ibeji, told Vanguard that she was the last person to patronise the family that night.
According to her: “ When I got to the shop to get some pain relief medicine for my ailing son, they were already closing for the day. I saw their two children sleeping.
“I gave them N500 but they suggested that I should either bring the money tomorrow (today) or leave it with them and come for my balance the next day. I took the money with a promise to bring the N220 to them today. But to my shock, the unthinkable occurred .”
The fire was said to have started from their pharmaceutical shop located on number 13 of the street while Eze, his pregnant wife, Sarah and their two children of ages five and eight were sleeping.
Another resident, Mr. Ezenwa Uche, told Vanguard: “Perhaps, they all would not have died had there been other tenants in the compound with them. From all indications, it was obvious that they all slept inside the shop where the fire started from.
“We were alerted by the shout of fire at about 3a.m. Though we tried there was nothing anyone could do to salvage the situation because the fire had extended to the main building.”
Father’s love
“From the positions of the charred remains, it was obvious that Kenneth carried one of the children and attempted to escape, as the bodies were seen in that posture,” Uche added.
The spokesperson for the Lagos State Police Command, Chike Oti, a Superintendent of Police confirmed the incident. He said: “The family lived alone in the building. The fire consumed the bungalow and the shop.
“Policemen, firefighters and other rescue operators, who were mobilised to the scene, prevented the fire from spreading to other buildings.”
On his part, the Lagos State Director, Fire Service, Rasaq Fadipe, said that the incident occurred at about 2.48a.m., adding that the double burglary irons on the door and windows of the apartment prevented personnel of the Fire Service from reaching out to rescue the victims on time.
Speaking through the Service’s spokesman, Amodu Shakiru, he said: “ The apartment is a chemist store. The father, mother, and two children of ages five and eight were found dead inside the store.
“We advise that although one needs security in his or her house or business place, it should not be to the detriment of the people.
“Family members should always know the exit points in their apartments whenever there is an emergency.”

“These batteries have the potential to overheat, posing a fire and burn hazard to customers,” the US computer maker said at a website with details of the voluntary recall.

“Many of these batteries are internal to the system, which means they are not customer replaceable.”
The list of machines with the potentially problematic lithium-ion batteries included Probook, Envy, Pavilion, Zbook, Studio G3, and HP 11 models sold worldwide for the past two years, according to the online post.
Some batteries targeted for recall were also sold as accessories or replacements through HP or authorized service providers.
HP said it is notifying customers and will replace batteries for free. In the meantime, the US-based computer company advised people to only use the computers in a “safe mode” powered by plugging into outlets instead of by batteries.
HP is the consumer division created by the 2015 split of Hewlett-Packard, which spun out a separate business services unit called Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. AB

https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/a-year-before-lok-sabha-polls-the-race-to-get-bjp-ticket-from-pune-is-a-tight-one-5030814/,"With their focus on the Lok Sabha ticket next year, many aspirants in the BJP have started to re-connect with their voters.
The Lok Sabha election may still be a year away, but political activities in the city are heating up, with many BJP leaders eyeing the big prize — a party ticket to contest from Pune. In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, BJP MP Anil Shirole had won the Pune seat with a record margin after defeating Congress’s Vishwajeet Kadam. His victory had paved the way for the party’s next big win in the city, in the assembly election held later that year, when the BJP won all eight assembly seats in Pune. Last year, the party managed to win 100 seats in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) polls, coming to power in the civic body for the first time.
With their focus on the Lok Sabha ticket next year, many aspirants in the BJP have started to re-connect with their voters. On Friday, Shirole has arranged a get together for leaders from all political parties and prominent personalities from various fields . In his invite for the event, the MP said the event has been organised to connect with local residents and unite the society. “There is no time for informal discussion and open discussion… due to the busy daily routine. So, let’s meet on the pretext of a get together and begin the new year with new energy,” reads the invite.
Party leaders admitted that the get together was an evident attempt to connect with the public, as the Lok Sabha election is only a year away. “There is a possibility that the Lok Sabha election may be held before the end of the government’s five-year term. The chief minister has also directed the party cadre to start preparing for the election,” said a BJP leader.
The frequent visits of Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar to Pune has also triggered some concern among local leaders who are aspiring for the party ticket. Javadekar, a Rajya Sabha member from Madhya Pradesh, hails from Pune and has been active in national politics for a long time. “If the party asks the minister to contest the Lok Sabha election, then he would definitely prefer to contest from Pune, as he is from the city. He has already started connecting with the party cadre in the city and frequently makes his presence felt in Pune,” said a BJP leader.
Pune’s guardian minister Girish Bapat, who is in charge of the state food and civil supplies ministry, is also expected to stake his claim for the BJP ticket in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Bapat had staked his claim for the ticket in 2014 as well. Late Union minister Gopinath Munde had played a crucial role in Shirole emerging the winner in the race for the 2014 BJP Lok Sabha ticket from Pune.
“Next year, the race for the BJP ticket for the Pune Lok Sabha seat is going to be a tough one. Since it came to power at the PMC, the party has also suffered from factionalism in the city unit, so the aspirants will not leave any stone unturned to grab the ticket,” said a party leader. Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Kakade, who has been active in city politics since the PMC election, was recently summoned by state party leaders to ensure that there is no rift in the party’s city unit, as he had spoken up against some party leaders in the civic body.","A year before Lok Sabha polls, the race to get BJP ticket from Pune is a tight one"

Chinhoyi Municipality has set aside its 2014 resolution to retire more than 120 workers after management re-engaged the affected employees. According to council officials, council is considering rationalising salaries after it also reportedly failed to borrow $2 million which was intended for retrenchment packages for the staff to be laid off.
Chinhoyi has 372 workers chewing about $380 000 every month against revenue of around $340 000. Speaking during a full council meeting at Town House on Monday, Chinhoyi town clerk Mr Maxwell Kaitano said council had since engaged the affected workers.
“The issue of retrenchment is an in-house one, therefore, it must first go to the finance committee and then tabled in council for adoption. As management, we have agreed with workers to rationalise their salaries and avoid downsizing,” he said.
The issue is likely to be tabled before council this Friday. Last year, Chinhoyi Municipality applied to Government for the authority to borrow $2 million which was supposed to go towards retrenchment. Council had promised that the borrowed money would be repaid through savings.
The retrenchment of workers was aimed at cutting employment costs so that the municipality complied with Government’s 70-30 ratio for service delivery and employment costs. Council’s latest move to rescind its decision on layoffs is in line with the new political dispensation which is calling for the creation of more jobs.

They added that he was allegedly kidnapped by his cousin and his associates.The boy and his siblings were going for tuition classes when two men asked them for directions to the residence of his father’s elder brother. Despite being cautioned by his sister not to go with strangers, the boy volunteered to show them the way. Ransom call“His father approached the police around 8 p.m. on Monday stating that the boy was missing. A kidnapping case was registered and the police started looking for him,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (North-East) A.K. Singla, adding that the child’s photograph was distributed in the area.The police said the father returned around 5.30 p.m. the next day stating that the kidnappers had called twice demanding a ransom of ₹1 crore. “The first call came in around 12.30 p.m. on Tuesday and the second call around 4.30 p.m.,” Mr. Singla said, adding that the numbers were put under surveillance immediately.The police discovered that the first call was made from Panipat, while the second came in from Shahdara here. Uncertain about the child’s whereabouts, one team was sent to Panipat and 15 teams were deployed in Shahdara. “The father received another call around 6.30 p.m. from Delhi. Investigations revealed that all the calls were made from a PCO. The teams were deployed near the PCO,” he said.The police said the teams found the boy, and accused Tareeq and Danish near Mahavir Park in Shahdara during checking. Interrogation of Tareeq and Danish revealed that the plot to kidnap the boy was hatched by his cousin Mohsen, who wanted to make a quick buck. The duo revealed that they took the boy to Panipat for a night and returned to Delhi the next day.“Mohsen fled as soon as he learnt that Tareeq and Danish had been arrested. Mohsen is close to the boy’s father and handled the functioning of his three factories,” said Mr. Singla, adding that Mohsen met the duo in these factories.While Tareeq still works there, Danish had quit recently. The police said they suspected the involvement of a relative as the kidnappers kept telling the boy’s father that “they were keeping a close eye on him”. “We instructed the father not to tell anyone, including his family, about the ransom call or the investigation after that,” the officer said.Mr. Singla even claimed that the control room for surveillance was set-up in his office instead of the police station to maintain secrecy.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/965457/villegas-tells-parents-help-kids-discern-fake-news,"ANGELES CITY—Archbishop Socrates Villegas has called on parents and educators to help the youth develop critical thinking to distinguish the fake news from the legitimate ones on social media.
“You do not just allow others to make a judgment on your behalf because there is no substitute to a conscience that is enlightened and then a conscience that is making its own discernment,” he told a national conference of the Association of Catholic Universities of the Philippines (Acup) at the Holy Angel University here on Wednesday.

“They don’t even have to be Christians. If you see evil, you should not keep quiet. You should call evil, evil. You should call it wrong because it is wrong and offer an alternative which is right, which is what it is to be human, and what it is to be Christian,” he said.
Villegas, head of Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan and past president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, also said the Christian message is “essentially confrontational” as he encouraged youth leaders and educators to defy evil.
He gave the advice to conference delegates who gathered here to reflect on the “Amoris Laetitia” (The Joy of Life), the apostolic exhortation on the family.
“We are not afraid to shake up principles, beliefs, paradigms and viewpoints that are essentially and evidently contrary to the Gospel values,” Villegas said.
“Cowardly companions are not allowed. We are not war freaks. We are not troublemakers but we should not offer consolation without challenging and confronting evil.”
He reminded Acup members that Christ rebelled against the wrongs committed in his time.
Family life and education, he said, should be both an “encounter” and an “accompaniment” with Christ.
“The accompaniment that the Pope offers in Amoris is [one] that confronts evil, [while] at the same challenges you to be better. Accompaniment is not a see-no-evil, speak-no-evil thing. It is rather confronting evil,” he said.
In an interview, Villegas said young people are immersed in “so many values that are contrary to the Gospel and to authentic values.”
He said: “Amoris Laetitia is not about sex. It has been misunderstood. It has been misinterpreted and this is sad.” Amoris is “not a lighthouse but a torch that walks with the people,” he added. /jpv

There are indications that oil spillage, occasioned by sabotage and other factors have dropped in the Niger Delta by 27.3 percent.
Many oil companies, including International Oil Companies, IOCs and indigenous companies did not disclose their oil spill data.
But a compilation of 2017 data obtained by Vanguard from Shell Petroleum Development Company Limited, SPDC, a leading IOC, and operator of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, Total and Agip joint venture with over 500,000 barrels per day output indicated that the company recorded a total of 76 spill cases in 2017.
A breakdown showed that 44 spill cases were recorded in the first half (January – June) of the year, leaving 32 cases for the second half (July – December).
The company attributed most of the cases to sabotage while a few were attributed to other factors in the region.
For instance, on January 3, 6, 13, 15 and 21 of 2017, Shell stated that it recorded six oil spills on land and swamp as a result of sabotage.
It indicated that: ”Recovery completed on 07 Jan 2017, assessment completed on 12 Jul 2017, clean-up and remediation planned for April 2018. Recovery completed on 11 Jan 2017, assessment completed on 17 Feb 2017, clean-up and remediation completed on 19 Sep 2017, site certification planned for February 2018.
”Recovery completed on 24 Feb 2017, assessment completed on 29 Apr 2017, clean-up and remediation planned for May 2018. Spill was contained on 14 Jan 2017, no recoverable oil found, assessment completed on 24 Mar 2017, clean-up and remediation not required, site certified on 04 Apr 2017.
”Spill was contained on 21 Mar 2017, no recoverable oil found, assessment completed on 24 Apr 2017, clean-up and remediation planned for January 2018. Spill was contained on 20 Jan 2017, recovery completed on 04 Apr 2017, assessment completed on 07 Feb 2018, clean-up and remediation planned for May 2018.”
Consequently, the company has in recent times attributed many allegations of environmental pollution by communities to sabotage, operational failure and other factors. Dissatisfied, some of the communities have headed to the courts in Nigeria and overseas.
The case of Bille and Ogale
In May 2015, UK solicitors, Leigh Day, filed oil spill claims against Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) on behalf of Ogale and Bille communities in Rivers State.
Bille and Ogale are areas heavily impacted by crude oil theft, pipeline sabotage, and illegal refining, which remain the main sources of pollution across the Niger Delta.
Specifically, Ogale is in Ogoni land, where SPDC has produced no oil or gas since 1993, as access to the area has been limited following a rise in violence, threats to staff and attacks on facilities.
Leigh Day argued that SPDC owes a duty of care to Nigerian communities impacted by massive crude theft and the resultant pollution, and that RDS owes a similar direct duty of care to prevent oil spillage as a result of intentional third-party interference from damaging Niger Delta communities.
SPDC and RDS responded that an English court has no jurisdiction over these claims, arguing that claims by Nigerians against a Nigerian company about events in Nigeria, governed by Nigerian law, should be heard in a Nigerian court.
High court, appeal judgments
After listening to all parties, the High Court decided RDS had no legal responsibility for harm to the communities in the Niger Delta caused by criminal interference with the operations of a joint venture in which the Nigerian government owns a majority interest. As such, the claims have been dismissed.
The judge rejected Leigh Day’s claim that RDS owed a duty of care to the Nigerian claimants allegedly impacted by SPDC, and consequently there is no anchor defendant for the case against SPDC to be brought in England.
Not satisfied, Leigh Day appealed the decision and the appeal hearing took place November 21-23, 2017.
On February 14, 2018, the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment, dismissing the appeal.
Specifically, the Court of Appeal dismissed the claimants’ appeals and affirmed the lower court’s decision that the claims against RDS were bound to fail and should be dismissed.
This means that SPDC does not come into the jurisdiction of the English court, so the case against both RDS and SPDC should not proceed in England.
Stakeholders’ comments
The judgment has attracted the comments of some stakeholders. For instance, General Manager External Relations for The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), Igo Weli, stated that: “The Court of Appeal has rightly upheld the earlier decision that this case should not proceed in the English courts.
“Nigeria has a well-developed justice system that is capable of dealing with these claims. Both Bille and Ogale are areas heavily impacted by crude oil theft, pipeline sabotage and illegal refining, which remain the main sources of pollution across the Niger Delta. Litigation in courts unfamiliar with the law and realities on the ground ultimately does nothing to address the issue of criminal interference in the operations of a Nigerian company.
“SPDC works with a range of stakeholders, supporting the industry’s search for solutions to these complex issues.”
The President, Eleme General Assembly, Israel Gomba Abe, advised that, “The people of Ogale should try and litigate within the confines of Nigeria. The courts will hear them. Let them not entertain any fear of not having fair hearing or proper judgment.”
Report
Meanwhile, Shell stated in its latest report that: ”Illegal refining and third-party interference are the main sources of pollution in the Niger Delta today. Third-party interference is the cause of 90% of the number of spills of more than 100 kilograms from The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited operated Joint Venture (SPDC JV) pipelines in 2016.”
”Security in parts of the Niger Delta remains a major concern with persisting incidents of criminality, vandalism, threats from self-described militant groups, host community agitations and offshore piracy. There were renewed acts of sabotage by self-described militant groups on oil and gas infrastructure in parts of the Niger Delta in 2016, which severely impacted oil and gas operations. For example, export operations at the SPDC- operated Forcados Oil Terminal (FOT) were disrupted after three sabotage incidents in 2016.
”This resulted in loss of revenue, particularly for domestic producers who rely on the FOT for export. Facilities operated by both indigenous and international oil and gas companies were vandalised by attacks and other illegal activities such as crude oil theft, which led to a sharp decline in oil and gas production and incidents of environmental contamination. The consequences included a loss of revenue for the Federal Government of Nigeria and major disruptions to gas supply to power electricity for industry, businesses and public sector services.”
However, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, added in a statement that over 700,000 barrels per day of crude oil was deferred in 2016 alone due to pipeline sabotage.
The corporation added that from January 2017 till date, it recorded 27 breaching incidents on the Trans Niger Pipeline, TNP, adding that for the Trans Forcados Pipeline, TFP, with a capacity of 300,000bpd, 17 breaches were recorded in 2016.

The JUI District Councillor Maualan Naveedullah has presented vote of no confidence motion with the acting District Naib Nazim Inaytullah Khattak for counting against the District Naib Nazim Sajjad Barakwal five days ago, but they failed to complete the requisite numbers of district councillors for counting and today 24 district councillors including 11 of JUI-F, 1 of ANP, 2 independent and 10 district councillors of PTI including the District Nazim Dr Umer Daraz cast their vote against the District Naib Nazim and he was de-seated.
While six district councillors of PTI remained absent from the proceeding of no trust motion. The JUI-F sources said that now his party would elect its own District Naib Nazim and his nomination would be finalized in a couple of days.
The sources claimed that a candidate for the slot of District Naib Nazim would be brought to consensus and claimed that the party has already completed homework for it.
They dispelled the impressions that there were any rifts in the party ranks on the nomination of the candidate for the post of District Naib Nazim and claimed that soon the situation would be cleared.
The sources privy to the disgruntled members of the PTI claimed that there was a secret agreement with the JUI-F in this regard and added that now the annual district budget would be approved from the district council as the District Naib Nazim was a block in it.
PARTIES ANNOUNCE TO BOYCOTT BY-POLLS
Staff Reporter from Timergara adds: Political parties in Lower Dir on Sunday announced to boycott the by-polls to be held on 20th February. Talking to media men here at Timergara candidates nominated by various political parties for the upcoming by-polls in the union council Sultan Khel including Mujeebur Rahman, Sadeequllah (JI) and Abdul Sattar (PTI) announced to boycott the by-polls scheduled for February 20, 2018.
“We have decided to boycott the by-polls because we are not satisfied with arrangements made by election commission as no separate polling station had been set up for women”, they argued. Those candidates who lost their seats knocked at the door of the court and election commission of Pakistan to declare the by-polls null and void as not a single woman had used her right to enfranchisement, they added.
It merits mentioning here that the Election Commission of Pakistan had declared null and void the by-polls held in Lower Dir on December 21 last year as not a single woman had cast her vote during the polls and some of the losing candidates had filed writ petition against polls in the court with the plea that women were debarred from the polls.",JUI-F topples PTI’s naib nazim in Karak

The operation is a special month-long drive to trace and rehabilitate children. It started on February 1 and will run throughout the month.
Among the children who have been traced, missing complaints of only 41 were registered. A total of 135 children have been reunited with their families, while the remaining 38 have been sent to child shelter homes. Police said they are trying to find details of their parents.
Six children who have been traced by the police are from other states. This includes two from Uttar Pradesh, two from Delhi, one each from Chandigarh and Haryana.
The figures were released during a meeting called by the additional director general of police (ADGP) Ashok Kumar to review the progress of Operation Smile.
According to police data, maximum number of children have been traced in Haridwar district. Between February 1 and 15, a total of 29 missing children were traced in the district. This was followed by Champawat where 28 children were traced.
The three plain districts of Haridwar, Udhamsingh Nagar and Dehradun contributed 39% of the children who have been traced. This indicates the high crime rate in these districts and the same has also been established in past reports.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/02/27/wakanda-and-the-dream-of-a-black-homeland/,"Wakanda, the fictional black utopia that Black Panther rules as king, is so majestic on the big screen as to steal many scenes in the film. The kingdom occupies a central role, almost playing supporting actor to the brilliant leading cast of Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong’o and Michael B. Jordan.
This is no accident. Wakanda is the spiritual core of the Black Panther story and always has been.
AD
The hope of a bountiful, independent black land has fueled the aspirations of many in the African diaspora for at least the past 500 years, as historian Nathan Connolly recently pointed out. The Haitian Revolution secured the Western hemisphere’s first independent black nation in 1804, despite considerable military resistance from French colonizers and without any support from the hemisphere’s other democratic republic, the United States. Haitians envisioned the land as their means to overcome the legacy of colonial oppression, hoping to secure their political independence through economic self-sufficiency.
AD
But Haiti was not the only place in the region where the hope for black independence thrived. Despite the nearly universal institution of slavery among Europeans in the Americas, runaway maroon communities and free black communities throughout the Western hemisphere acted as persistent beacons of both the desire and ability of black peoples to build their own prosperous, independent areas.
During the post-Civil War Reconstruction, scores of newly emancipated African Americans built new lives on parcels of reclaimed lands in areas like South Carolina’s Sea Islands (though President Andrew Johnson would soon reverse the plan). Booker T. Washington, himself formerly enslaved, opened his school in Tuskegee, Ala., to train young black men to secure their economic independence through working the land or building their own business communities.
AD
Land mattered, because it meant economic, and therefore political, independence. In the 20th century, Marcus Garvey of the Universal Negro Improvement Association championed Pan-Africanism and possible migration back to Africa, a message that deeply resonated with Malcolm X’s father. Years later, X himself would lead a movement to secure both economic and political security for black Americans through the cultivation of a strong black identity and community ownership of both property and local political institutions. By the mid-1960s, the significance of securing a land of their own — whether through individual private property or in an independent state — was firmly established as a major component of the long civil rights movement.
AD
It was not long after Malcolm X emerged as a national figure advocating for this vision that the comic Black Panther debuted, appearing in Fantastic Four No. 52 in June 1966. This was the same month that James Meredith was shot while marching to encourage African Americans in Mississippi to register to vote. It was also the same year that a political group in Oakland, Calif., would take up the mantle of the Black Panther Party — no direct correlation to the comic book character — in an effort to defend black control of their community and expand opportunities in their neighborhoods.
While Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were creating an exotic faux-African utopia for their predominantly young white male audience interested in anti-establishment postures, they largely ignored the specific hardships of contemporary civil rights activists who were struggling for the basic rights to express their political and economic needs without being beaten or killed.
AD
This utopia — Wakanda — was the centerpiece of that first Black Panther story. As the Fantastic Four approached the kingdom from the air, a dense jungle obscured any view of civilization. “The jungle looks so primitive … so undeveloped,” puzzled Mr. Fantastic, Reed Richards. He was certain they were in the wrong place. When their aircraft broke through the foliage, however, the superheroes could hardly believe their eyes. What they saw was a “world of sheer wonderment,” a miraculous, futuristic city hidden beneath the canopy.
AD
As Marvel further developed the lore over the years, Wakanda was described as the most scientifically and technologically advanced civilization in the world — not to mention the wealthiest. The leader of this tremendously successful African nation was the brilliant, strong and mysterious warrior-king T’Challa, known as the Black Panther. Along the way he defeated the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia and outclassed Mr. Fantastic as the smartest man in Marvel. Still, Black Panther and his glorious Wakanda were not much more than a pop culture novelty until just a couple of years ago.
Everything changed when National Book award-winning author Ta-Nehisi Coates signed a deal with Marvel Comics to write a new Black Panther comic series in 2016. Upon release, “Black Panther” immediately became the best-selling comic book of the year. Coates titled his first story arc in the series “A Nation Under Our Feet,” a nod to the 2003 Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the same name by historian Steven Hahn, a book that recounted black political activism between the Civil War and World War I.
AD
Coates’s title was apt for his story. Once again Wakanda was central, serving as the battleground for a monarch burdened by a difficult past and people no longer interested in serving a king. Coates made the connection between land and people explicit in a dreamlike sequence depicting a black father and daughter pleading for rain on sunbaked desert and then dancing in the downpour. “Once when I was tree,” the author wrote in poetic sequence, “African soil nourished my spirit.”
AD
Ryan Coogler’s new “Black Panther” film, too, revolves around the intimate connection between Wakanda and the freedom it provides for its people. T’Challa’s voice opens the film asking his father to “tell me the story of home.” To cross over into the ancestral realm from which T’Challa derives the powers of the Black Panther he must be buried under the Wakandan soil.
Spirit and soil are inseparably united in this film. Wakanda is a land isolated from the world, disguised as another third-world agrarian nation, and this isolation serves as an allegory of the way that Wakandan leaders had shut off their hearts from the sufferings and struggles of the African diaspora. T’Challa is forced to choose whether to keep his people and land secluded or to let the soil of Wakanda nourish the black world.

https://times.mw/graduating-malawis-poor-households-out-of-poverty/,"The tale of one Christina Samson, 35 from Mangochi was until recently a story of difficulty and challenge. In her own words, she was stuck in poverty, doing casual labour to feed her children. With help from an international organisation, Concern Worldwide, Samson now faces the future with renewed hope.“I have benefitted a lot, for instance, I have used the recent cash transfer to buy maize and other basic necessities for my family. I want to build a better house and see my children attaining education, get jobs and live independently,” she said. Concern Worldwide is implementing a programme called Graduation and Resilient Livelihoods in Nsanje and Mangochi.The programme targets extreme poor and poor households in these districts and through a mix of consumption, business skills training, mentoring and assets or cash transfer. Samson is not the only beneficiary who is appreciative of how the initiative is helping to eradicate household poverty. Hawa Idi from Kwalipo in Mangochi is also one of the people who are reaping benefits of the programme in Mangochi.The 38 year–old Idi said in an interview that her household’s fortunes have tremendously improved since the programme was launched in 2017. “It is changing lives here in Mangochi. Previously, my household had no steady source of income as we had no business to run due to a lack of capital. But Concern Worldwide has provided us with a start-up capital with which I have managed to open a mini shop for assorted groceries. I hope to build a brick house with iron sheets in future,” Idi said. The programme is currently reaching out to 200 households in the two districts but the target is to reach out to a total of 2000 households.The aim is to support the beneficiaries to sustainably graduate into higher wealth brackets and to be self-sufficient beyond the lifespan of the programme. It is funded by contributions from Irish Aid, United Nations Children Fund – Unicef and Accenture. Recently, Concern Worldwide organised a meeting in Lilongwe to share successes of the programme with key stakeholders from government, development partners, UN agencies and non-government organisations. Deputy Director (Poverty Reduction and Social Protection) in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and Development Dalitso Kalimba acknowledged how the initiative is contributing towards the aims of the Malawi National Social Support Programme II (MNSSPII).“Government values the work that you are carrying out to eradicate poverty at households’ level and ensure households are able to rise out of grinding poverty in villages and rural areas” Kalimba said. Concern Worldwide Country Director, Caoimhe de Barra, emphasised that their aim is to develop a model that can be adopted more widely in Malawi, drawing on the extensive experiences of the entity from graduation programming in other countries. The firm’s Livelihoods and Resilience Coordinator Chris Mjima explained that the programme is designed to graduate people out of poverty by identifying the extreme poor and poor households.These are then provided with consumption support through cash transfer of K15,000 per month, accompanied by business skills and training, mentoring and larger cash or asset transfer they should use to start up their businesses to create sustainable sources of income. Aside from the 2000 households to graduate from extreme poverty, there is also hope that 6000 households will equally say goodbye to poverty under the enabling environment component of the initiative. The enabling environment component, according to Mjima, involves promoting a community–wide approach to addressing problems which affect all poor people in the community.Reporting on the lessons learnt from the first year of implementing the project, Programme Manager for Concern Worldwide in Nsanje, Akunsitu Kananji, highlighted that community participation is key for project acceptance, while physical household verification helped to ensure targeted households met the criteria of being extreme poor or poor.“Involvement of district government and community stakeholders is key to better targeting, and inclusive targeting has improved the participation of individuals with a disability in the programme” Kananji noted. Other stakeholders pointed out some of the challenges the initiative is likely to face, including the high level of poverty prevalence in the country which often leads to criteria being arbitrary, leaving eligible households excluded from programmes.A representative of the Chief Social Welfare Officer for the Social Cash Transfer Programme (SCTP) under the Ministry of Gender, Children, Disability and Social Welfare, Chifundo Nanchunkwa pointed out that they are interested in the progress of the graduation programme and seeing the value it can bring for poor households.She expressed hope for increased collaboration and engagement in the course of the programme. As the fortunes of Samson and Idi change for the better through the Graduation and Resilient Livelihoods programme, one can only hope for the continued progression of the programme so that it can benefit a lot of people.A vibrant writer who gives a great insight on hot topics and issues",Graduating Malawi’s poor households out of poverty

From Apple Inc. to Google, when global CEOs want to showcase their commitment to the Indian market, they no longer look for photo-ops against the famous marble mausoleum of a long-dead emperor’s wife. Instead they take a selfie with India’s reigning movie king.
Dara Khosrowshahi did just that last month on his maiden trip to Asia as Uber Technologies Inc.’s new chief executive officer.
This is the part where the the fancy CEO tries to look cool by posing with Bollywood superstar @iamsrk, the King Khan himself. Note to self: gotta work on my haircut ... pic.twitter.com/K8eliu0aa9 — dara khosrowshahi (@dkhos) February 23, 2018
Tellingly, Khosrowshahi gave Singapore -- Uber’s regional headquarters -- a miss on that visit, reinforcing speculation that the ride-hailing app would sell its Southeast Asian business to Grab. The deal was announced on Monday. Grab is taking over Uber’s operations and assets in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. In exchange, Uber gets a 27.5% stake in its closely held rival; Khosrowshahi will join Grab’s board.
Since the negotiations earlier this month were said to be for a stake in the high teens or 20%, according to a Bloomberg News report, Uber appears to have done pretty well.
Still, the real victory unquestionably belongs to Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group Corp., the single-biggest investor in both companies. As I wrote earlier this month, by engineering a retreat for the US company before any more bloodletting for market share, Son ensures that six-year-old Grab will emerge as an early champion in a winner-takes-all business.
A faster path to profit for Uber could also boost its valuation ahead of a planned IPO next year. But at what cost? Having already surrendered China to Didi Chuxing, beating a retreat from Southeast Asia is a precursor to perhaps losing India, the lone remaining jewel in Uber’s once-flourishing Asian empire.
In India, once again, SoftBank is the largest investor in Uber’s main rival, Ola. Competition between the two apps has become ridiculous. For all the PR gobbledygook on how happy Uber and Ola drivers are, the reality is that many who took out bank loans to acquire new cars are hurting badly. There’s a glut of ride-hailing cars; wages have collapsed. Banks are collecting on “DUD,” -- my moniker for “distressed Uber debt” -- by repossessing vehicles.
| Read: High margins vs driver incentives: The Ola, Uber business model
Ride-hailing drivers recently mobilized a strike using WhatsApp message groups. As they stayed home, Mumbai’s traffic was blissfully light for at least two days last week. Such is the extent of oversupply.
Son will be doing disgruntled drivers a favour by taking Uber out of the equation so that Ola can raise prices. Resistance will be futile. Ola is expanding in Australia, and for now SoftBank hasn’t stopped it from encroaching into Uber’s territory. Maybe that will be a bargaining chip in peace talks, whenever they ensue.
Just as the fall of Singapore was the beginning of the end of Britain’s sway in Asia, so will ceding the city make it very hard now for Uber to hold on to India, no matter who’s in the selfies. Bloomberg Gadfly

http://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/navy-impound-642-bags-rice-smugglers-ibom/,"UYO—No fewer than eight suspected smugglers are now cooling their heels in the cell of the Nigerian Police at Oron in Akwa Ibom State even as 642 bags of rice have been impounded.
The suspects were nabbed by the Nigerian Navy Forward Operations Base (FoB), Ibaka at the weekend and handed over to the Nigerian Custom Service which subsequently transferred them to the Police for prosecution.
Commander, FoB, Captain Yusuf Idris, who performed the handing over of the suspects, said the Navy would not relent in its fight against criminality on the waterways.
He said: ‘’In line with the existing cooperation between the Navy and the Custom, we are here to hand over another group of suspects who smuggled items into the country through Cameroun for prosecution.
‘’There is an improvement. In the last two months it was becoming a weekly affair because whenever we went out,we made arrest. But the Eastern Naval Command has told them to keep clear. And we have seen reduction in the level of criminality on the waterways. Under the leadership of the Chief of Naval Staff, it is a zero tolerant for all maritime offences’’.
The Assistant Comptroller of Custom, Oron Out Station, Auwal G. Ali, commended the Navy for the collaboration which he stated was yielding fruits with the continuous arrest of suspected smugglers in the area.
Ali, who represented the Comptroller Eastern Command, Aliya Masay said: ‘’we wish to thank the Navy for a well done job. This is the third times we are here and the Navy is giving us what we expect. The Navy is assisting the Custom in fighting smuggling. However, the needful is to prosecute them for the offence. Once again, we are grateful for these efforts’’.
One of the suspects, Bruno Owobiakuno (45) said the Navy started shooting as soon as they were sighted close to the tank farm and they had to surrender to them.
‘’We have reached home and they arrested us at the tank farm. We have to obey them. We don’t have any argument to make with them. We just started the business just to make ends meet and be able to train our children in schools’’, he said.
Item recovered from the suspects included 642 bags of rice, two cotonou boats, four Yamaha outboard engines, water pumping machine and petrol.

https://business.inquirer.net/249169/quality-life-defined-space,"Space matters.
And this is perfectly true when it comes to one’s home, as space helps define one’s quality of life. But having enough area to move around and go about seems more of a luxury these days, given the rising costs of property and the scarcity of land that can still be developed.
ADVERTISEMENT
But how does space really affect one’s way of life? And why is it crucial to have enough room to move around?
A previous report of The Atlantic cited experts, who warned of the potential health risks that go with tiny spaces or the so-called micro-apartments.
“Sure, these micro-apartments may be fantastic for young professionals in their 20s,” said Dak Kopec, director of design for human health at the Boston Architectural College and author of Environmental Psychology for Design.
“But they can be unhealthy for older people, say in their 30s and 40s, who face different stress factors that can make tight living conditions a problem,” Kopec further claimed.
Aware of the importance of space, many developers have worked hard to create projects that would allow for a more comfortable and relaxed living, either through their amenities, open spaces or large unit cuts.
One developer who has since been creating developments that afford one the luxury of space is trusted property developer, Empire East Land Holdings Inc. Through its different projects, Empire East has allowed homeowners to experience space and convenience on an entirely new level.
Understanding the need of urban dwellers to have access to a true urban sanctuary, Empire East has delivered projects that have all the elements needed to achieve a well-balanced life.

http://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/04/danjuma-umaru-dikko/,"Dead men do not see, that explains why Alhaji Umaru Abdurrahman Dikko is apparently unaware of happenings in the country today especially one big inexplicable mind game between two men who were fingered in his abduction 34 years ago.
Dikko was kidnapped in London by operatives of the Israeli secret service, MOSSAD, backed by the government of Maj. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari who was Nigeria’s military ruler at the time. It took the wits of a young British Customs officer, Charles David Morrow, to foil the move.
As minister of Transport under the Shehu Shagari government, Dikko, had stepped on many big toes. Former Army Chief, Gen. Yakubu Danjuma, was affected in the Niger Delta. When the President moved Dikko to the Special Duties Ministry, he seemed to have become even more powerful.
According to him, the problem with Danjuma began when the ban on politics was lifted by General Olusegun Obasanjo and of the six parties registered, Dikko, joined the National Party of Nigeria[NPN]. Danjuma was alleged to have told the politician that the NPN would not win the presidential elections. Of course, the party did.
There was the impression that Dikko’s problem with Buhari could have started in the Second Republic when the former worked for the creation of another state from Kaduna State, which meant excising Katsina from the old state. That did not go down well with the latter.
Dikko, was smart from cradle. With a First Class degree in Mathematics from Birkbeck College, University of London, he veered into journalism working with the British Broadcasting Service[BBC]. Buhari was also in the United Kingdom but chose the military through Mons Officers Cadet School, Aldershot.
When Gen. Yakubu Gowon balkanized the nation into 12 states, Buhari and Umaru Dikko found themselves in North Central State, governed by Maj. Abba Kyari, a Kanuri Artillery officer. Dikko was from Wamba, near Zaria, Buhari’s hometown is Daura, both men, Fulani.
Kyari picked Dikko, 31, as Commissioner for Finance in 1967.Lt. Buhari,24, was gearing up for the Civil War and his first posting was in the frontlines around Enugu-Nsukka under the First Infantry Division, commanded by Lt.Col. Mohammed Shuwa, another Kanuri man.
Dikko and Buhari are Fulani, Danjuma is Jukun, from Takum. Infact, Dikko boasted that he was not just an ordinary Fulani but a descendant of Sheik Uthman Dan Fodio, the jihadist. Many thought the mathematician was so full of himself. When political power was added to the swashbuckling nature, probably a few individuals wanted to check him.
Those who finally sacked President Shagari were majorly his Fulani kinsmen. They included such young officers as Majors Mustapha Haruna Jokolo, Sambo Dasuki, Abdul Mumini Aminu, Abubakar Dangiwa Umar and Lawan Gwadabe. And who was to benefit from the coup?
Maj. Gen. Buhari, the one who irked Dikko by not listening to the Commander-in-Chief as he marched to Ndjamena, the Chadian capital in the bid to teach that country an evergreen military lesson for invading Nigeria in 1983. Buhari was in Jos as General Officer Commanding, Third division, when he was chosen as a Head of State.
It was ironical. The night they struck, December 31, 1983, was Dikko’s 47th birthday. It is difficult to believe that Buhari chose that date because he was not part of the plot, in the first place. Buhari and Dikko are December children. The general was born on December 17.
Dikko was not comfortable. He disappeared to the UK, through the now famous NADECO route, Benin Republic, along with his Private Secretary Elizabeth Hayes. They journeyed to Togo and took a flight from Lome. Hayes would later save his life. She would also become Mrs Dikko.
The Buhari government was not comfortable with the flight to London. Dikko did not keep his mouth shut either. He mounted a strong campaign against the Beret Boys. Minister of Information, Group Captain Emeka Omeruah, told the media that the former Transport minister stole in billions, without mentioning the currency. The official charge was one billion dollars.
Many years after the failed kidnap, Jokolo told the world that the plot had the hand of Danjuma and the seal of
Buhari. He could have been in the know because, Jokolo, who was later to become the Emir of Gwandu, ended up as Buhari’s Aide de Camp after the December 31, 1983 coup.
It was strange that although there were no diplomatic ties with Israel, the Nigerian government involved MOSSAD. Jokolo gave it to Danjuma, who would later deny this in 2001, at the Justice Chukwudifu Oputa led Human Rights Violation Investigations Commission.
Perfectly executed, it was. Ex-MOSSAD officer, Alexander Barak, was picked for the job. He got in touch with Dr. Lev-Arie Shapiro in Jerusalem and Felix Abitbol. A Nigerian retired Military Intelligence agent, Maj.Mohammed Yusuf was involved. He drove a van to Dikko’s 48 Porchester crib, in Bayswater, London.
Dikko was abducted and whisked away. They tranquillized him, moved and shackled him to a crate with Shapiro as his ‘room mate’, just to make sure he did not give up and drove him straight to Stansted Airport, 64 Kilometres North of London. Not Gatwick, not Heathrow.
Another crate contained the other kidnappers. Both crates were tagged as Diplomatic bags. The import was that they would not go through thorough customs check. Miss Hayes had alerted the Police and they swung into action. Morrow saved the day, for Dikko was almost gone.
The Nigeria High Commission headed by Maj. Gen. Anthony Haladu Hananiya, played a huge role. Two diplomats, Okon Edet and Peter Ayodele, were active participants. A Nigeria Airways Boeing 707 flight was ready at the cargo terminal. Group Captain Bernard Banfa made sure of that. All four who tried to abduct Dikko were arrested and jailed.
Dikko died in 2014.Today, Danjuma is not happy with President Buhari, because herdsmen are killing Jukun villagers. Dikko made up with Danjuma before death. I wonder how the dead feels in his grave. If only he could see.

https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/include-early-to-revised-text-warning-on-tobacco-packets-delhi-govt-suggests-union-health-ministry/,"Additional Director (Health) Dr S K Arora in his letter to the Union health ministry said death can be natural too, but cigarette smoking causes premature death. (Express File Photo)
The Delhi government has suggested the Union Health Ministry to add the word ‘early’ to its recently revised text warning — ‘Tobacco causes painful death’ — which, it said, does not clearly explain the fact that the life span of tobacco users get shortened. The revised text along with enhanced pictorial warnings and a national toll-free number to help tobacco users quit addiction, will cover 85 per cent of each packet of tobacco products from September 1.
The text warnings that will be printed on the packets are ‘tobacco causes painful death’ and ‘tobacco causes cancer’. The Delhi government’s health department lauded the revised warnings saying they will have more effective impact in prevention of tobacco use, but claimed that the text ‘tobacco causes painful death’ does not clearly explain that the life span of tobacco users gets shortened.
Additional Director (Health) Dr S K Arora in his letter to the Union health ministry said death can be natural too, but cigarette smoking causes premature death. Life expectancy for smokers is at least 10 years shorter than of non-smokers, the official said.
“So, the words ‘Tobacco causes painful death’ clearly does not explain the very fact that the life span of tobacco users also get shortened. Therefore, it is suggested that if we can add the word ‘early’, so that the revised wordings can be ‘Tobacco causes early painful death’, will affect the mindset of people more and the message will be more clearer,” Dr Arora said in the letter.
The Union Health Ministry had on April 3 issued a notification regarding amendments on using the new warnings and including the toll-free helpline number — 1800-11-2356, which has been set up to help tobacco users fight their addiction by providing support and guidance. Last month, the Centre had extended the duration of existing health warnings on packets of tobacco products till August 31, from its earlier deadline of March 31.
According to Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi, a cancer surgeon at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, around 12 lakh deaths occur every year in India due to tobacco usage. Almost 40 per cent of non-communicable diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases and lung disorders, are directly attributable to tobacco use, he said.
Chaturvedi, who is also a member of the committee which finalised the the recent pack warnings, said use of tobacco is responsible for nearly 50 per cent of all cancers in India and 90 per cent of mouth cancers.",Include ‘early’ to revised text warning on tobacco packets: Delhi govt suggests Union Health Ministry

George, stands dismantled.The members of the squad have been asked to return to the Armed Reserve camp. It was formed along the lines of the City Task Force of the Kochi City Police in January 2017.Sreejith was picked up by members of the RTF from his home, sparking off a sordid tale.The squad was constituted unofficially and was an informal arrangement by the SP to put brakes on the goonda menace and narcotic problems in the district. As such, its dismantling needs no direction from the top echelons of the force, officials sources said. The decision came shortly after Opposition Leader Ramesh Chennithala demanded its dismantling at a press conference in Thiruvananthapuram.Sources privy to the decision said that the move to disband the squad came in the wake of a discussion the SP had with the squad members at the headquarters of the Ernakulam Rural Police. The three members of the RTF, who had picked up Sreejith, were suspended by the SP in the face of stiff protests from local residents who laid siege to the national highway with the body of the victim.Apparently, the decision had not gone down well with the squad members who felt that the SP did not defend them despite the squad directly reporting to him. The squad members reportedly met the SP and expressed their discomfort in remaining part of the squad following which it was decided to dismantle the force.Incidentally, the SP had accorded good service entries to the 10-member RTF squad for its action in fighting the drug menace.

With April 20 being the last date to join the PG courses, anxious candidates have alleged that the private medical institutions are denying admissions despite payment of fees for their allotted seats.Out of the 147 students allotted seats through Centac in the PG medical and dental courses in Puducherry, 22 have paid their fees as on Thursday. At least four students filed complaints at the Centac grievance cell.A student from Karaikal, who was allotted a medical seat in a private medical college in Puducherry and had paid the fees through Centac, was refused admission to the college. The student the filed a complaint with the grievance cell on Wednesday and returned to her home town. A candidate in Puducherry, who relinquished his seat allotted through Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) in a deemed university in order to join a private medical institution in Puducherry, said he was not admitted even after paying the fees stating a court case.The student added that he approached the institution on April 13 but the Registrar asked him to wait till the court hearing on April 17. “The Centac asked me to pay the fees. I am still not sure if I will be given admission,” he said.Puducherry UT All Centac Students Parents Association President M.Narayanassamy said several students approached them to address the problems they are facing.“Despite being allotted seats through Centac, the private medical institutions are providing different reasons and delaying admissions. Admissions to a few minority students have been delayed following the G.O. passed by the Puducherry government. “The government should ensure that these the institutions abide by the rules,” he said. When contacted, Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences Registrar Anil Purty stated that they had challenged the government order to allow minority students from All India quota instead of reserving it to students from Puducherry alone. “We have received a court order in our favour. We are yet to get a copy of the order,” he said.However, Centac convenor P.T.Rudra Goud underlined that once the fee is remitted, private medical institutions cannot deny admission to students. The rules are clear and the Puducherry government has also passed an order that minority students from Puducherry should be given priority in the private medical institutions.“We are not aware of the court order and the institutions have not given us any copy of the court orders. Only if the seats are not taken will it be given to the minority students from All India quota. As per the Supreme Court orders, the medical institutions cannot deny admissions to the students who have already remitted the fees,” he said.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1002037/news-gays-homosexuals-lgbt-supreme-court-gay-marriage-same-sex-marriage,"Days before the annual pride march, a gay rights advocate and the government is set to face off at the Supreme Court (SC) over the bid to legalize same-sex marriage in the Philippines.
The SC’s oral arguments could not have been more timely as it was scheduled to be heard in June, which is celebrated annually as Pride Month by Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) communities across the world.
ADVERTISEMENT
Pride month is celebrated in honor of the June 1969 Stonewall riots in the United States when members of the LGBT community staged violent demonstrations in Manhattan, New York City, against constant police harassment and social discrimination.
In 2015, amid growing clamor to recognize the right of same-sex couples to civil marriage all over the world, lawyer Jesus Nicardo Falcis III, who identifies as “openly” gay, filed a petition before the SC seeking to legalize gay marriage in the Philippines.
READ: SC asked to allow same-sex marriage
Falcis said it was high time for the SC to act on the matter “because of the millions of LGBT Filipinos all over the country who are deprived from marrying the one they want or the one they love.”
In June 2015, the US Supreme Court declared that same-sex marriage was a right to be enjoyed by all Americans. Days after the US high court’s decision, Falcis filed a petition before the Philippine Supreme Court hoping it will take its cue from the US high court.
READ: SC sets oral argument on same-sex marriage
Three years after Falcis filed the petition, in March 2018, the SC announced that it would hear on June 19, Tuesday, the oral arguments on the bid to scrap the prohibition of same-sex marriages.
Falcis is set to argue that denying same-sex couples the right to marry is tantamount to deprivation of life and liberty without due process of law, among other arguments.
Named as respondent in Falcis’ petition is the Civil Registrar General. Petitioners-in-intervention are LGBTS Christian Church Inc., Reverend Crescencio “Ceejay” Agbayani Jr., Marlon Felipe and Maria Arlyn “Sugar” Ibanez, while lawyer Fernando Perito is the intervenor.
The oral arguments were set by the SC en banc at 2 p.m. At the same time, LGBT groups and supporters will converge outside the high court for a rally in support of same-sex marriage.
“During the rally, we will be singing songs and chanting slogans that celebrate our being a family. We will hold a mass renewal or taking of vows for LGBT couples that will be attending, especially those of you that have already undergone Holy Union. Afterwards, we will hold candle lighting and a vigil,” the LGBTS Christian Church Inc. said in a statement. /cbb

https://dailytimes.com.pk/251792/karachi-to-face-prolonged-load-shedding-after-eid-2/,"KARACHI: Karachiites may face power outages after Eid as Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) has decided to reduce gas supply to K-Electric (KE), it was learnt on Sunday.
As per industry sources, the SSGC has decided to curtail gas supply to KE by almost half to 90 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd), while currently, 190 mmcfd gas is being provided to KE by SSGC.
Sources said that the reduction in gas supply to KE by SSGC will lead to 500 megawatts cut in power production while this additional shortfall of 500 megawatts in system will lead to 5 to 10 hours load-shedding in the city.
Sources said former PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had formed a committee headed by Miftah Ismail in April to resolve commercial matters between the two companies due to which SSGC had cut supply to KE.
This decision had come after people of Karachi had endured long suffering and worst power shortage in years.
The gas supply was resumed but seems like it was only temporary and not to the full satisfaction of companies nor any settlement was done between provincial and federal governments to resolve waterboard matters and outstanding dues.
Waterboard was important to settle the commercial matters of all 3 utilties of water, gas and power serving Karachi in fair manner and on same unanimous terms, however, no consensus was achieved on waterboard matters driving committee process to standstill, added sources.
Now once again, SSGC has decided to cut gas to KE. Meanwhile Karachiites once again are left guessing whether they will be provided with gas, water and power supplies on the Eid days. SSGC claimed that KE did not fulfill its commitments.","Against cabinet committee's decision, SSGC decides to cut supply to KE"

His personal security officer was also killed in the attack while another security guard was critically injured.
Bukhari was 51. He is survived by his wife Tahmeena, son Tamheed and daughter Duriya. His brother Basharat Bukhari, a broadcaster-turned-politician, is a senior PDP leader and Minister for Horticulture, Law, Justice & Parliamentary Affairs in the Mehbooba Mufti-led government. READ | Who was Shujaat Bukhari?
The killings, on the eve of Eid, left Srinagar stunned and there was all-round condemnation. Bukhari was among those who had welcomed the Centre’s announcement of suspension of security operations during Ramzan — the ceasefire announcement, he wrote, “came as a glimmer of hope for the common people who have been suffering due to the continuous grind of violence”.
Director General of Police S P Vaid told The Indian Express: “He (Bukhari) has been shot dead. There were three to four of them (gunmen). It was obviously targeted fire. They fired directly (at him)”. He said one of Bukhari’s PSO had been killed and another injured.

The attack took place in the evening as Bukhari stepped out of his office and sat in his car. There was heavy firing and the gunmen, who had come on motorcycles, fled, taking advantage of the rush in the market ahead of Eid.

https://thenationonlineng.net/ex-rep-bamidele-three-others-shot-at-fayemis-rally/,"There was confusion at the Ekiti State All Progressives Congress (APC) secretariat on Friday when a trigger-happy Mobile Policeman (MOPOL) opened fire as the party’s flag bearer, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, arrived to a tumultuous welcome.
Former House of Representatives member, Hon. Opeyemi Bamidele and three other party members were hit by the bullets fired by the unidentified cop.
Bamidele who was hit on the arm in the orgy of shooting was said to be receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital at the time of filing this report.
Fayemi, his wife, Bisi, Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, deputy governorship candidate, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, Secretary to Ondo State Government, Mr. Ifedayo Abegunde and other senior party figures escaped being killed.
They had all accompanied Fayemi from the Akure Airport to Ekiti State where they were received by unprecedented crowds of party supporters and residents in Ikere-Ekiti and Ado-Ekiti.
The shooting which happened at about 5.00 pm happened as Fayemi and members of his entourage were making their way out of the party secretariat to continue the rally round the town.
The MOPOL officer who fired the gunshots was overpowered and disarmed by angry party members and given the beating of his life but was later saved by his colleagues from being killed by the angry mob.

Party members alleged that he was a fake MOPOL officer sent to disrupt the rally calling on the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Ibrahim Idris, to investigate the shooting incident.
The culprit was trying to keep the surging crowd at bay when he suddenly opened fire but lost control by shooting sporadically in a wrong direction.
Party leaders carried Bamidele and other victims from the scene.
The angry party men disarmed the policeman and descended on him and smashed his head with sticks and other dangerous weapons before being rescued and taken to a safe custody.
The incident caused pandemonium at Ajilosun area of Ado-Ekiti as residents scampered to safety to avoid being hit by stray bullets.
The entourage was received by the state APC executive led by the Chairman, Chief Olajide Awe.
Before the shooting fiasco, Akeredolu and Fayemi, while addressing party leaders and members, declared the readiness of the APC to rescue Ekiti from poverty, hunger and underdevelopment.
Akeredolu applauded the party members for putting behind them the post primary crisis, saying with the crowd he saw today that Ekiti remains the stronghold of the APC.
Akeredolu said: “Fayemi has returned with full force to reclaim the land. He needs your support and this task shall be achieved in the mighty name of God.”
Fayemi said: “We are here to work for Ekiti and our party leaders and this we are going to do together because it is a collective responsibility”.
“We are going to work with everybody, including those who just decamped to our party, because we are one big family in APC.
“We shall win by the grace of God. Our case was like the case of a ram who moved backward to garner more strength. We are here to rescue Ekiti and it is a task we must achieve”.
Adeyeye, who joined the APC on Tuesday after twelve years in the PDP, said “Fayose is politically dead and buried.”
“I have returned home and my mission is to ensure that we killed Fayose politically by burying him.
“We shall mobilize well to achieve this task and by the grace of God, this is a must-win and must accomplished task for all of us.”
Earlier in the day, massive crowd trooped out in their thousands to welcome Fayemi into the state as the motorcade passed through Akure, Iju, Itaogbolu in Ondo State before the train reached Ekiti State.
There was a massive lockdown at Oke Osun, Odo Oja Oke’kere areas of Ikere where thousands of party faithful had gathered to welcome the flag bearer. The convoy arrived Ikere township at about 3.00 pm.
It took another one hour for the train to reached Ado-Ekiti where mammoth crowd was waiting to receive Fayemi and his team. They arrived the state capital at about 4.00 pm.
Enthusiastic residents held placards, banners and flyers with Fayemi’s portraits.
Fayemi was also welcomed by the Hausa, Ebira, Igbo and Urhobo communities, members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), market women and commercial motorcycle riders.
Traffic was at a standstill along Ikere Road in Ado-Ekiti for about three with party members holding party on the highway.

https://dailytimes.com.pk/254341/the-anatomy-of-the-ptm/,"If Cleopatra’s nose had been shorter, the whole face of the earth would have changed. And like Cleopatra’s proverbial nose, the extrajudicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud culminated in the rise of the Pakhtun Tahffuz (Protection) Movement (PTM). This incident is an example of the Contingency Theory of History, which states that “…a small event may cause history to change course, resulting in different outcomes.”
The martyrdom of Naqeebullah was another in a long line of deaths that Pakistanis have suffered since September 11, 2001. The number grows even larger if we count the lives lost during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. How different could things have been had the Cold War between the USSR and the US not spilled over into our region?Would there still be animosity between the Afghans and the Pakistanis? Would the Al-Qaeda even exist? Would terrorism be as widespread as it is today? It is hard to imagine an answer to all these questions, yet it is clear that these events in history still have the power to influence our world today, even after all these years.
The loss of the Russians and the withdrawal of American troops left a vacuum in the country, one that was filled by extremists, who have since caused the US and, especially Pakistan, a lot of problems. The people of FATA were particularly affected as many lost their homes and their lives during the war on terror. Hopefully the 31st Amendment to the Constitution can help restore some semblance of peace to the region.
However, during the most intense period of fighting, the US and Pakistan sent in thousands of troops to weed out the radicals that had taken refuge in the mountains of FATA and Afghanistan. Curfews were implemented and homes were bombed as collateral damage grew. US drone strikes were particularly harmful, as they seemed content with killing a few innocents as long as they hit certain strategic targets. The number of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) kept multiplying as well, and the majority had to live in temporary camp settlements, for months and even years on end.
Already bereft of even the most basic of human rights, the Pashtuns emotions had reached their boiling point. All the community needed was a spark, and that came with the extra judicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud in Karachi by Rao Anwar
In order to restore law and order in the region, Pakistan’s army established a network of check posts. Anybody passing through was subject to vigorous inspection, which at times could be aggressive and embarrassing for locals. While the army personnel might not have done any of this on purpose, it did hurt the sensibilities of the fiercely-proud Pakhtun community. I myself was subject to such treatment as well, and talking to superior officers did not work either, as they would present me with their own rationalisations for the behaviour of the check post guards.
During my childhood, FATA, or Ilaqaghair (no man’s land) as it was known then, was famous for being a marketplace for all kinds of forbidden or illegal things. These included drugs, weapons, stolen cars and smuggled goods, etc.
The locals were always at war with one another, and the state rarely ever intervened in the region’s affairs. The nineties brought with them the rule of the Taliban and the influence of the Al Qaeda, who in turn introduced their own brand of Islam. Once again the region was completely ignored by the people in power, till 9/11 when the War on Terror began. In the end, all this instability alienated the Pakhtuns, and made them feel like they were outsiders in their own country.
Already bereft of even the basic of human rights, like access to clean water, food and education, and subjected to vile jokes and stereotyping by the rest of the nation, the Pakhtuns reached a boiling point and there wasn’t much more of this behaviour they could take. All it needed was a spark, and that came with the extra judicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud in Karachi, by police officer SSP Rao Anwar.
The PTM is based on the actual need of the Pakhtun community for, one, recognition from the state, and two, for the restoration of their basic rights around the country. They are a non-violent movement and even though initially they wanted justice for Mehsud, they are now fighting for the entire Pakhtun population in Pakistan.
If the state truly hopes to find a resolution to the PTM, they will need to address the many grievances of the Pakhtun community and engage them in dialogue. By trying to censor any news or updates related to the movement, and by ignoring their justified demands for equality, will not only lead to the further alienation of the Pakhtun people, but also provide an opportunity for our enemies to exploit them for their advantage.
It is high time the PTM is seen for what it truly is, a movement for change and progress for our country. Like Cleopatra’s nose affected the world, perhaps Naqeebullah’s martyrdom might have the same effect and change Pakistan for the better.

Sources in the traffic department said 1,301 cases were booked in all wards of East Bengaluru.

“We checked for load and speed factors, including documents. The number of cases booked was higher than what we expected,” said Anupam Agarwal, DCP (traffic east). He said that cases of water tankers violating rules were more in areas like Whitefield, Kadugodi, Old Airport Road, Electronics City, Halasuru and Krishnarajapuram.
“These areas are IT corridors where residents are deprived of Cauvery water, especially those living in apartments. Hence, water tankers are rampant in these areas. We booked the maximum number of cases against water tankers in these areas,” he added.

https://dailytimes.com.pk/273603/the-yadav-jurisprudence/,"International law has no uniform coercive force, it only has amoral force. Some critics have called international law nothing more than positive morality due to its lack of law enforcing institutions, the powerful can go scot-free while the weak are grilled. Even those who insist that international law is indeed true law, agree with critics and call it ‘soft law’.
When the United States convicted Angel Francisco Breard for rape and murder and sentenced him to death in 1992, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered a stay of execution as he was not given consular access. However, the US hanged the convict, sending a message to the ICJ and to the world.
The ICJ without an enforcement mechanism against a military giant, went ahead only to declare that the United States was guilty of violating the Vienna Convention on Consular Access 1963 (VCCR) and the orders of the court. The Supreme Court of the United States declared that an order of the ICJ had no legal value in its jurisdiction unless Congress enacted it as law.
Just like the US, Pakistan too is a signatory to the VCCR. In April 2017, Indian national Khulbushan Yadav was convicted and sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for terrorism and espionage. The next month India knocked on the doors of the ICJ because consular access was not granted to the convict. The ICJ stayed the execution and barred Pakistan from executing the convicted terrorist.
India always knew that it would be very weak on the merits of the case. Nevertheless, it urged the ICJ to declare the decision illegal violating international law and treaty rights
It had nothing to do with legal standing, it only had to do with power. Pakistan, which was already weakened by an ailing economy, terrorism and the FATF intimidation, could not face isolation at the global level, which would be a virtual certainty if the verdict was not respected.
Article 36 of the VCCR provides for consular services, correspondence, and legal services to individuals detained in another state. This, however, is not the law of Pakistan, as the act of Parliament through which the convention was incorporated under Pakistani law, the Diplomatic and Consular Privileges Act 1972, does not incorporate Article 36 into our domestic law like parts of the rest of the convention.
India always knew that it would be very weak on the merits of the case, nevertheless, it urged the ICJ to declare the decision illegal violating international law and treaty rights. India then asked the court to order provisional measures (stay order) because otherwise before the ICJ could rule on the merits of the case Pakistan could have executed the convicted terrorist.
This stay order could have been avoided, but Pakistan made a number of vacuous mistakes. It had the right to appoint an ad hoc judge yet it waived its right. It has been alleged that the foreign office did not take legal advice before initiating correspondence over the issue, this has not been denied by the foreign office. When the hearing took place, no senior official from the Attorney General’s department was present, only for the Attorney General to later boast that he would lead the case at the ICJ. Nonsensical and unprofessional heroism like this can cost us this case, despite our position as the stronger party.
Another colossal gaffe was the release of a videotaped confession of the convict. While the video tapes of Saulat Mirza, Uzair Baloch and Ajmal Pahari released for domestic consumption did their job in building a narrative supported by the security establishment, the international community was doubtful of the confession; the mandate of the VCCR is literally to ensure that detainees are not coerced into accepting criminal guilt. We played this move illogically.
Even though it is not a part of Pakistani law, Pakistan has still complied with Article 36(1) of the VCCR which has three parts. Under part one (sub-clause (a)) Pakistan complied by duly notifying India of the arrest and detention of Yadav. In the same way Pakistan complied with part two (sub-clause (b)) by providing India with the information on how Yadav was arrested from Balochistan and the treatment that he has received under detention. Pakistan does not has to comply with the third part (sub-clause (c)) relating to consular access because an exception is found within Article 36 itself which applies in this case. Any rights of the detainee under Article 36(1)(c) only have to be exercised in conformity with the domestic laws of the detaining state, as a result Pakistan does not need to provide consular access to the convicted Indian national.
The corpus juris of Pakistan contain comprehensive anti-terrorism laws due to its constant fight against terrorism. These laws, especially the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, Security of Pakistan Act, 2014 and the Pakistan Army Act 1952 are directly applicable to the case and therefore any ‘rights’ of the accused have to be balanced against the paramount considerations of Pakistan’s national security.
The ICJ has to take these considerations into account, exigent issues such as terrorism and espionage require the ICJ to adopt a purposive approach and get to the core of the object of the VCCR. Consular access cannot be forced unto a detaining state when the matter involves national security and terrorism, as the judges of the court have no expertise in such matters dropping the confidence in the court in countries combating terrorism.
In fact, Indian cooperation in this case has been absent, while Pakistan’s thirteen attempts at access to information held by India were refused every time. Furthermore, Iran is keeping mum on the Indian claim that the convict was kidnapped from Iran.
An explanation of the convict’s passport which has a Muslim name on it has also gone unexplained by India which argues that the convict is a retired Navy commander. Even though Pakistan was not required to grant any consular access, it facilitated a meeting between the convict and his mother and wife on humanitarian grounds to ensure fair treatment. Pakistan also stated that such a meeting can take place again, thereby terminating the role consular officers of India could have played.
While there are many instances where India has gone back on its words, Clause 6 of the Agreement on Consular Access signed between India and Pakistan in 2008 states that in cases of arrest, detention, or sentence made on political or security grounds, each side may examine the case on its merits.
The objective was simply to not give terrorists any leverage by either country as a result of consular access. Under international law, all treaties are equal and if there are conflicting treaties, the one enacted later in time would be given primacy. It is clear that even if the ICJ comes to the conclusion that the VCCR was applicable in this case, this treaty from 2008 would be the real legal panacea for this case.
When India loses this case at the ICJ, which with all certainty it would, its losses would not stop there. India has been a consistent opponent of internationalising bilateral issues, but has it just given Pakistan justification for such a course of action and shot itself in the foot?

https://www.manilastandard.net/news/world-news/271346/rescuers-scour-scorched-greek-towns.html,"Athens―Rescue workers in Greece scoured charred homes and burned-out cars on Wednesday as the toll from some of the worst wildfires this century was expected to rise from at least 74 dead and 187 hurt. Scores of locals and holidaymakers fled to the sea to try to escape the flames as they tore through towns near Athens stoked by 100-kilometer-per-hour wind gusts, devouring woodland and hundreds of buildings. Greek media have described the disaster as a “national tragedy”, while Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras cut short a visit to Bosnia and announced three days of national mourning. The government has not yet said how many people are still missing from the fires, which broke out on Monday, as firefighters continue to battle blazes in some areas. Terrified residents and tourists were overtaken by the flames in homes, on foot or in their cars. AFP photographers saw the burned bodies of people and dogs. The charred bodies of 26 people, including small children, were discovered at a villa at the seaside resort of Mati, 40 kilometers northeast of Athens, rescuers said. They were huddled together in small groups, “perhaps families, friends or strangers, entwined in a last attempt to protect themselves as they tried to reach the sea”, said rescuer Vassilis Andriopoulos. “Mati no longer exists,” said the mayor of nearby Rafina, Evangelos Bournous, adding that more than a thousand buildings and 300 cars had been damaged. On Wednesday a blaze was threatening houses near the seaside town of Kineta, 25 kilometers west of Athens. Dozens of firefighters were battling the flames aided by helicopters and planes dropping thousands of gallons of water. A fire service official said that searches to find those missing from the fires would continue Wednesday, although there was still no official word on the number of people still unaccounted for. The death toll is almost certain to surpass the 77 people who perished in blazes that ripped through the southern island of Evia in 2007. Some 187 people have been hospitalized, with 82 still being treated on Tuesday evening, including almost a dozen children, most of whom were in a “serious condition”, the fire services said.Rain is forecast for the coming days, which will help efforts to douse the flames after temperatures topped 40C (104 Fahrenheit) on Monday. Dramatic video footage showed people fleeing by car as the tourist-friendly Attica region declared a state of emergency. Athanasia Oktapodi, whose home is surrounded by pine trees, said she first spotted the fire moving down the hill “and five or ten minutes later it was in my garden”. “I ran out like a crazy person, got to the beach and put my head in the water. Then the patrol boats came,” said the 60-year-old. “I saw the flames outside the window of our hotel. I thought it would explode,” said Alina Marzin, a 20-year-old German tourist who had been staying at the Capo Verde hotel in Mati on Monday evening with her brother and their parents. At least six people died trying to escape the flames into the sea. Some 715 people were evacuated by boats to Rafina, the government said. “People are shocked, lost. Some of them have lost everything: children, parents, homes,” said Red Cross spokeswoman Georgia Trisbioti. The European Union activated its Civil Protection Mechanism after Greece sought help. Several countries said they were sending aircraft to help fight the flames. The EU’s humanitarian crisis manager, Christos Stylianides, arrived in Athens on Tuesday to assist relief efforts. “Today is a day of great sorrow for the Greek people and for all of Europe,” he said on Twitter. The wildfires come as record temperatures in northern Europe have seen blazes cause widespread damage in recent days.",Rescuers scour scorched Greek towns

https://indianexpress.com/article/india/autos-cabs-off-roads-in-bengaluru-due-to-strike-against-amendment-to-mva-5295222/,"Transportation services are likely to be hit in Bengaluru Tuesday due to the nation-wide strike called by the All India Motor Transport Organisation over the Motor Vehicle Amendment Bill. The protesters, who are demanding withdrawal of the Bill, will stage a demonstration outside Town Hall this morning before marching to Freedom Park.
Auto-rickshaw and taxi drivers will participate in the strike. “About 1.5 lakh autos in Bengaluru will not operate,” general secretary of the auto drivers’ union Rudramurthy was quoted as saying by Times of India. He added that other unions have extended support to them.
Government services, including BMTC, KSRTC and the metro will not be affected.
Also read | What is Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill?
The Bill seeks to allow private players to enter the public transport sector. Workers fear the step towards privatisation of the sector will give way to monopolisation and threaten jobs. There is also fear that the sector, which is a state subject, will lead to an increase in fares for the public.
The Bill was introduced in Rajya Sabha during the ongoing monsoon session on July 23. Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has been trying to get Opposition member onboard to pass the Bill in the Upper House, where the NDA is in minority. The Bill, which will amend the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, was unanimously passed by Lok Sabha on April 10, 2017.

The main contention among Opposition members is that the Bill infringes upon the rights of the state. TMC leader Manish Gupta told The Indian Express. “This is also a ploy to bring in large corporates into the state transport system at the cost of small players. Transport is a social cause for states too — it is not just a business.” Gadkari, however, has repeatedly denied this. When the Bill was being referred to a Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari had said, “We made it clear to members that we have not tried to impinge on the right of the state governments and we do not want to privatise state transport corporations,” he said.","Bengaluru: Autos, cabs off roads due to strike against amendment to MVA"
https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/08/nigeria-fast-becoming-destination-of-choice-for-tourists-lai-mohammed/,"A 49-year-old man, Gbenga Olomilua, has urged a Grade C Customary Court sitting at Inanlende, Ibadan, to uphold the divorce request of his wife, Rashidat, alleging that her promiscuity has no bound.
Newsmen report that Olomilua told the court on Wednesday that his 10-year-old union with the plaintiff was characterised with cheating, nagging and disrespect.
”I married her when she was nothing. Although I didn’t pay her dowry, yet I took care of her and provided for all her needs to make her satisfied.
”I work in Lagos, but I spend my weekends in Ibadan. Unfortunately, she used my absence as an opportunity to learn the acts of infidelity from her friends.
”She is now an expert, whose promiscuity has reached an alarming stage. She hardly stays at home to take care of the two kids of our marriage.
”She is fond of nagging, and she will never listen to or obey my instructions and command as the husband.
“In this regard, her decision to end the marriage is a welcome development,” Olomilua stated.
NAN reports that Rashidat, 32, had earlier prayed the court to dissolve her marriage on grounds of brutality and unrest of mind.
She accused her husband of turning her into a punching bag when they quarrel.
“He even cut my hair with a razor in one of our fights. My lord, I am scared, because I am not sure of what he wants to do with my hair.
“He does not treat me as a husband will treat his lovely wife. He maltreats me, never providing for my needs,” she said.
Rashidat, therefore, said that since there was no more love in the relationship, the court should have both parties go their separate ways.
The President of the court, Chief Ramoni Olafenwa, thereafter, dissolved the marriage and gave the custody of the first kid to Olomilua.
Olafenwa directed the second child to remain with Rashidat and ordered the respondent to pay N4,000 as monthly upkeep allowance for the second child.
He admonished the parties to keep away from each other and maintain peace.

Now Metro says two-thirds of the losses over the last two years have come during off-peak hours, when rebuilding efforts make riding difficult and the accompanying disruptions drive customers away.
AD
AD
The model, developed by consultant VHB, found the factors that “best correlated” to ridership changes are service-related: train frequency, the number of trains in service and the proportion of trips delayed beyond periods of 10 minutes or 30 minutes, according to Metro.
“Not surprisingly, when the number of trains serving a station increases, ridership increases; and when the percentage of trips delayed increases, ridership decreases,” Metro spokeswoman Sherri Ly said.
“Public transportation only works if three things come together: Convenience, reliability and affordability,” Metro board chairman Jack Evans said. “That’s it. You don’t need consultants to tell you this.”
AD
The study cost $460,000.
Metro says the modeling tool can help in crafting its upcoming fiscal year 2020 budget, when fare hikes will be back on the table. The last round of increases and accompanying service cuts in 2017 incensed riders already fed up with chronic service disruptions.
Insights from the consultant’s analysis were gleaned from discussions with individuals familiar with the work and were confirmed by Metro.
AD
The VHB analysis homed in on several factors Metro had previously identified as driving ridership. For example, it “confirmed that ridership is a function of service quality/quantity, development around rail stations and along bus corridors, track work, events/weather, and gas prices,” Ly said. “The finding that service quality and reliability is critical to ridership confirms the importance of many Back2Good initiatives that resulted in 80 percent customer satisfaction last quarter for the first time since 2014, as well as transit-oriented development near and around stations.”
AD
(Metro introduced a program called the “Rush Hour Promise” this year that refunds fares to riders’ SmarTrip cards if their trips are delayed more than 15 minutes from Metro projections.)
The finding may seem obvious but could prove deeply consequential for an agency already facing operating constraints. Metro must adhere to a new 3 percent cap in growth in its operating subsidy under Virginia’s new dedicated-funding law.
AD
The agency’s financial situation is complicated by an arbitration ruling last month ordering Metro to provide pay raises to its workers. Metro’s arbitrator, citing its revenue challenges, concluded the agency does not have the money.
AD
The majority opinion of the arbitration panel outlined Metro’s fear of a “death spiral,” in which a lack of capital investment would lead to ongoing service problems, further driving away riders and deepening Metro’s revenue hole.
Metro says its average weekday ridership is stabilizing. In July, average weekday trips totaled 644,000, a 2 percent increase from the previous year — even when a partial closure hit the Red Line late that month.
The 2020 budget proposal, Metro said, will see the model’s debut. It could be used to answer hypothetical questions around a potential fare hike, for example.
AD
Evans, a proponent of a $2 flat fare, said he wants the region to consider a plan that would lower fares, not raise them.
AD
He acknowledged however, “there is no silver bullet. . . . There is no short term solution that gets people back.”
The problem is, Metro needs to make a turnaround. The agency is under pressure from state and local governments, arbitrators and credit rating agencies to increase ridership. Moody’s, which downgraded Metro’s bond rating to A2 in 2016, affirmed that rating in August with one notable change. On the heels of securing dedicated funding commitments from around the region, Metro’s outlook was changed from “stable” to “positive.”
But Moody’s noted that ridership remains a key challenge for Metro.
In one scenario, Metro’s bond rating could be upgraded in the event of “stabilization or improvement in ridership that increases predictability of passenger fare revenue and enhances WMATA’s operating flexibility.”
AD
AD
In another, Metro’s rating could fall further in the face of a “continued downward trend in ridership.”
Metro’s revenue picture also is complicated by Uber and Lyft, which have provided little information about how many passengers they are transporting in the region on a daily basis.
While the VHB tool has the ability to account for ride hailing’s impact on ridership, the lack of available data has prevented Metro from conducting such an analysis. New data-sharing requirements set to take effect in October could solve that problem, however.
Nat Bottigheimer, a former assistant general manager for planning and joint development at Metro, illustrated the agency’s challenge this way:
AD
“There’s a very clear relationship between stabbing and mortality. The theory is pretty straightforward — [a certain percentage] of [stabbings] result in death. For here, there’s really not science on that, and there’s also not enough” data from ride-hailing companies.
AD
Metro last estimated that at least 30 percent of its rail ridership losses were caused by service and reliability problems, with the balance attributed to factors such as telework, federal workforce reductions, ride hailing and the rise of other alternatives.
Bottigheimer said the answer to Metro’s ridership problem boils down to a simple strategy.",A consultant told Metro what many riders already know: It’s the service that’s driving them away

Voting 197-0 without abstentions, the lower chamber approved House Bill No. 6760, which would amend the Labor Code of the Philippines by further strengthening several of its provisions to give more protection to women employees in the workplace.
ADVERTISEMENT
The bill, principally authored by former Diwa party-list Rep. Emmeline Aglipay-Villar, declares as discriminatory any company action or policy that favors a male employee over a female employee with respect to dismissal of personnel or the application of any retrenchment policy of the employer solely on account of their sex.
Favoring a male employee over a female employee with respect to promotion, assignment, training opportunities, study and scholarship grants solely on account of her sex is also prohibited by the bill.
Fine or imprisonment
Under the measure, it shall be unlawful for any employer to deny any woman the employment benefits provided under the laws by reason of her sex.
In addition to other penalties as may be provided by law, the proposal imposes a fine of P50,000 to P200,000 or imprisonment of three months to three years, or both, at the discretion of the court to any employer found guilty of committing any of the prohibited acts.
The institution of any criminal action shall not bar the aggrieved employee from filing an action for money claims.
Any foreigner found guilty shall be immediately deported upon completion of service of sentence.
Penalty of officers
On the other hand, any employee or person who willfully abets or aids in the commission of the prohibited acts or who causes the commission of any such acts by another would be liable in the same manner as the employer.
ADVERTISEMENT
For offenses committed by a corporation, trust, partnership, firm, association or entity, the penalty shall be imposed upon the guilty officer or officers.
Other authors of the bill include Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Majority Leader Rolando Andaya Jr., and Representatives Strike Revilla of Cavite, Estrellita Suansing of Nueva Ecija, Horacio Suansing Jr. of Sultan Kudarat, Randolph Ting of Cagayan, Mark Go of Baguio City, Makmod Mending Jr. and Amihilda Sangcopan of Amin party list, Vicente Veloso of Leyte, Luis Raymund Villafuerte Jr. of Camarines Sur, Gus Tambunting of Parañaque City, Raul del Mar of Cebu City, Ron Salo of Kabayan party list, and Virgilio Lacson of Manila Teachers party list.

https://www.zimlive.com/ex-botswana-leader-ian-khama-lectures-zimbabwe-on-good-governance/,"BULAWAYO – Zimbabwe must enforce good governance systems, create strong independent institutions and hold public officials to account if the country wants a quick economic turnaround, former Botswana President Ian Khama said on Thursday.
Khama was speaking at a Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) congress in Bulawayo, where he was invited to speak on how Botswana leveraged diamonds for economic development and what lessons Zimbabwe can learn from that experience.
“I’m not here to lecture to Zimbabweans on how to run their country and their economy because I believe very strongly that you already have most of what you need. In terms of human resources, we know and we can confirm that Zimbabweans are very innovative and have a very excellent work ethic. Indeed Zimbabweans have contributed to the development and success of Botswana,” Khama said.
“All that is needed in the country is policies and programmes to be put in place to bring about a culture of good governance in order for you to succeed.”
His audience of business executives applauded when Khama, who stepped down in May this year, said economic growth should be driven by the private sector while government acts purely as a facilitator.
He cited the example of Botswana’s independent procurement entity that awards tenders for government work.
“No cabinet secretary can make a decision but the independent body, which has an appeals process for anyone who feels aggrieved,” Khama noted.
“You have natural resources in abundance and we strongly believe in Botswana that economic growth should be driven by the private sector, government acting purely as a facilitator. Botswana attained independence from Britain in 1966 and we were ranked one of the poorest states – happily dependent on foreign aid with per capita of around $70. Agriculture then was sustained by the beef industry which accounted for an estimated 40 percent of the GDP and also the bulk of export earnings. Cattle raring was the primary economic activity for a majority of households and exports of beef accounted for 85 to 90 percent of total exports for the country. Then the discovery of diamonds in 1967 led to a decline of agriculture as diamonds contributed to the national growth in terms of GDP and export values,” he said.
The outspoken former leader noted that afterwards, Botswana rapidly became one of the world’s development success stories since 1989 and was classified as a middle-income country.
“The discovery of diamonds and mining development created an opportunity for Botswana to create robust economic progress. Diamond mining now contributes around 38 percent of national GDP, 80 percent of government income and 35 percent of government levy,” he said.
Confining himself to his administration, Khama said they had dedicated themselves to prudent macroeconomic policies, good governance, sound economic management and strong checks and balances to ensure public accountability or spending was monitored.
“We’ve been accused too much for being overregulated, for having too much bureaucracy when it comes to the checks and balances but you need a compromise. Don’t allow bad habits to develop through fraud to corruption,” he said.
On checks and balances, Khama narrated that during his time in office, a committee was established to assess performance and rate every minister and their permanent secretary.
“The minister would appear before me with that committee and it would inform me of their performance ratings. For the minister, this sat at the back of their mind that they had no time to sit back or for complacency.”
Khama noted that his administration prioritised the ease of doing business, established healthy foreign reserves, created a strong, stable currency and has an independent, vibrant central bank.
He emphasised the need to let those in power know that they could be arrested anytime for corrupt activities as they were not above the law.
“Fighting corruption has contributed to economic development. We have reinforced that through independent entities to combat corruption. First, we said zero tolerance but that statement has to be followed by action. We created a directorate, which is independent and is able to investigate anybody so no-one is protected, whatever label, whether minister or politician. The directorate investigates everybody. As long as there is concrete evidence that someone is in conflict, they would be prosecuted and go to court,” Khama told his audience.
“The key thing is to let people know they are not above the law and no-one is immune. That sends a message. In my time, a couple of ministers went to court but were acquitted but that demonstrated we do not bend rules for anyone.”
He said politicians must desist from making decisions based on political expediency, usually at a cost to the fiscus.
“It’s so easy in a democracy that you rely on people to vote for you and then you throw money on issues that you think are populist but at the end of day they come back to bite you and that’s unsustainable. It is very important to resist the urge to do so and eventually you will be rewarded at the polls for doing the right things,” he said to cheers.
In Zimbabwe, Khama noted that politicians had to respect their constituencies and honour what they promised in their manifestos.
“Manifestos don’t give you a license to stay away from people for five years without coming back to them for a review of your mandate. You have to constantly engage with people to find out if what you are doing is to their liking and if there is anything new they want you to introduce in that five-year programme.
“We need to come to a stage where we put politics and elections aside. Every Zimbabwean must work to bring about what you desire because other things are going to hold you back. Like I said, I can’t tell you what to do but certainly it happens in Botswana; see South Africa what goes on in their parliament, sometimes you wonder how the government can make progress. Look at the British parliament as well and you see how they go at each other across the floor. I’m sure it happens in this country as well.
“Sometimes politics, even though it is the way, are we politicians really the right people to be leading countries at the end of the day? Is this the best we can do?”
The former president also urged captains of industry to always tell the truth and bring effective decision making.
“Why would one not want to speak the truth? It not only applys to captains of industry, I know from my experience and it happens in other countries as well that sometimes people want to lie such as government officials. Even a minister would not tell you everything or the whole story, they would tell you what they think maybe you want to hear.”",Ex-Botswana leader Ian Khama lectures Zimbabwe on good governance

http://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2018/09/06/sorry-nadal-survives-marathon/,"NEW YORK — Defending champion Rafael Nadal survived an epic US Open quarter-final confrontation to defeat battling ninth seed Dominic Thiem 0-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/5) and reach the semi-finals for the seventh time.
In a gripping four-hour 49-minute contest which concluded at 2:04 a.m. on Wednesday, world number one Nadal won through to keep his bid for a fourth title in New York and 18th Grand Slam crown on track.
However, the 32-year-old was fortunate to triumph on another hot and humid night at Flushing Meadows, 24 hours after Roger Federer had been dumped out of the tournament by John Millman.
After suffering a first set “bagel,” Nadal had to battle back from breaks in the third and fourth sets before seeing off the first top 20 player he had faced at the US Open since 2013.
“I suffered, that’s the right word,” said Nadal after playing his longest ever match at the tournament.
“I said to Dominic I am sorry. He’s a great guy, a close friend who will have many more opportunities to win the big titles.”
Nadal had defeated Thiem in the Roland Garros final in June but this was their first meeting away from a clay court.
“He has a great attitude and is a great fighter,” added Nadal.
In a dramatic final set, Nadal saw five break points come and go before Thiem went long with a smash on the first match point.
It was his 58th unforced error on a night when he sent down 18 aces and fired 74 winners.
The semi-final will pit Nadal against third seed Juan Martin del Potro for the second successive Grand Slam.
At Wimbledon, Nadal came back from two sets to one down to win in five in a quarter-final which stretched to almost five hours.
Thiem broke three times in a 24-minute first set on Tuesday, handing Nadal just his third “bagel” at a Grand Slam.
The top seed won just seven points in the opener.
‘Wake up’
“I told myself ‘wake up,’” said Nadal.
Nadal recovered from being broken as he served for the second set in the ninth game with an immediate break back to level the contest.
Thiem then grabbed a 4-3 lead in the third which he stretched to 5-3 but then it was his turn to crack as Nadal raced away with three games to claim a two sets to one lead.
Thiem was 4-2 ahead in the fourth set before he was again reeled in and he was two points from defeat in the 12th game.
But he took the tiebreaker before Nadal just proved the steadier of the two in the final set decider.
Del Potro reached the semi-finals for the third time, defeating John Isner 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 and ending American hopes of a first men’s champion at the event since 2003.
Del Potro dropped his first set of the tournament against 11th seed Isner, who was playing in his maiden quarter-final at his home Slam.
Despite that, the 29-year-old was never broken in the 3 hour 31 minute match where Isner unleashed 26 aces but was undone by 52 unforced errors compared to Del Potro’s 14.
“To reach the semi-final again here in New York in my favorite tournament is very special to me,” said Del Potro after his eighth win over Isner in 12 meetings.

Having a background in marketing and sales with Ray-Ban and Suzuki Motorcycles, Zosa gives a better grasp of the digital marketing landscape along with his five years of experience at Innity. He witnessed and experienced the evolution of the digital industry which started with display banner ads, social, mobile, programmatic, and now with data.
Zosa has been entrusted with managing the business operations of Innity Philippines Inc. He is responsible for overseeing profit, revenue, cash, and quality targets, as well as developing and implementing strategies to grow the business and broaden customer base.
In addition, Zosa leads the Philippines team by performance monitoring, mentoring, coaching, training, and ensuring quality deliverables meet the company’s goals. As the company representative, he is also in command of building and sustaining relationships with customers and suppliers.
Fabian Looa, Chief Operating Officer and Co-Founder of Innity, describes Zosa as a highly motivated individual.
“GJ has a strong strategic focus and is very committed to delivering the business results through the team he leads on. He demonstrates intelligence in sales and marketing capabilities. He has a grasp of how the Philippine media industry works and commands instant respect from his coworkers. To us, he is an outstanding leader who can motivate and direct a very diverse team to a common goal and success.”
When asked where the digital marketing is leading, Zosa says: “Through our client encounters, we can see how powerful performance marketing is in this industry. Clients are shifting their attention from impressions, clicks, and views towards performance-based campaigns such as conversions, direct relation to sales, sign ups, and cost per acquisition. Right now, in the Philippines, we want to take the leap coming from cost-per-click, to cost-per-engagement, and eventually mastering cost-per-acquisition.
Data will play a key role in our strategies as we keep in mind the value of the 3R’s in marketing (Reach, Relevance, Resonance). As an instrument, our proprietary technology, Data Management Platform will be used as our main tool to enrich consumer insights.”
Explaining Innity Philippines’ track this year, he says: “We are currently focusing our efforts on analyzing and interpreting data to each industry to come up with strategies that are tailor-fitted to various markets in order to gain higher consideration in the brand’s marketing funnel.

Prasad made these remarks at the Constitution Day function organised by the Supreme Court. CJI Ranjan Gogoi and other judges of the top court were present.
“Governance being a highly complicated exercise, may be there is a need to reflect within as to how far the judiciary needs to go. That is for the judiciary to decide,” he said.
Read: Not heeding advice of Constitution will result in descent into chaos, says CJI
Prasad said there are lots of “competing interests”, “lot of complicated claims, lot of other vested interests” that need to be understood when running a government.
“Yes, I understand the temptation with greatest respect. But mere temptation should not lead to taking over of the power that leads to a larger narrative of some reflection,” he said.
He was responding to remarks made by Attorney General K K Venugopal and Supreme Court Bar Association’s Vikas Singh earlier on the issue of separation of powers between the legislature, the judiciary and the executive.
In the past too, Prasad has referred to the issue of judicial over-reach, saying law-making must be left within the realm of those elected to make the law.
Referring to the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, through which the government had sought to have a larger say in appointment of SC and high court judges, which was struck down by the Supreme Court, Prasad said while the government has accepted the judgment, it has certain reservations on some of the reasons given when it was struck down.
He, however, did not refer to the reservations.
In the past, though, he had dwelt on the issue extensively.
Prasad also referred to public interest litigations, saying the idea originally was to allow the marginalised and deprived to be heard.
“Perhaps time has come to restate more clearly the noble narrative of PIL,” he said.
Earlier Monday, during the inaugural ceremony, Prasad said, “We hear about constitutional morality, we appreciate innovations but nuances of constitutional morality should be outlined with clarity and should not differ from judge to judge and there must be a consensus.” He said, “We need to trust India’s democracy because they (the people) have this confidence that we can unseat any political leader or political party howsoever popular, howsoever powerful in Delhi or in states.”","Governance is executive’s domain, law minister says in presence of CJI"

 Tekno added that he was hoping to get back to what he loves doing the most as soon as possible, pleading for fans’ prayers and apologised for the inconveniences caused.
 “I am taking time out to fully recover and hopefully get back to doing what I love most soonest. I apologise, and if you can please pray for me, God watch over us all. Thank you.”
 Following the announcement, fans and fellow celebrities, including Tiwa Savage, Falz and Kizz Daniel took to Instagram to wish Tekno a speedy recovery.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-wildfires-evacuation/evacuation-plan-out-the-window-when-fire-hit-california-town-idUSKCN1NM0G5?feedType=RSS&feedName=environmentNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2Fenvironment+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Environment%29,"(Reuters) - When a “megafire” engulfed Paradise, California, officials and residents had to abandon their evacuation plans and improvise new ways to save lives, learning lessons that could help the growing number of U.S. communities at risk to wildfires.
As strong winds sent flames roaring into Paradise at 2 miles per minute, emergency personnel and locals realized their escape plans, crafted after a 2008 blaze, would not work.
“The lessons we had learned in the past kind of went out of the window due to the sheer speed and intensity of this fire,” Paradise Emergency Operations Coordinator Jim Broshears said in a phone interview.
The small mountain town was facing the so-called Camp Fire, one of a series of recent “megafires” fueled by drought, erratic winds and overgrown forests that quickly torch over 100,000 acres.
A week after California’s deadliest blaze, which killed at least 71 people, residents were critical of the town’s alert system. Broshears said other towns could save lives if they taught residents to shelter from fire and got more of them to sign up for alerts.
“GO ALL OUT”
As Paradise was engulfed around 8 a.m. on Nov. 8, officials attempted a staggered evacuation using their CodeRED alert system to target a zone at a time. They wanted to avoid the panic and chaos that ensued in 2008 as all 27,000 residents tried to flee at once.
With the fire toppling power lines and mobile towers, and residents jamming networks with calls, about 60 percent of CodeRED alerts were delivered, according to Troy Harper a spokesman for OnSolve, the company that provides the service.
Between 25 and 50 percent of residents had signed up for the optional system, Broshears said, meaning 30 percent of households, at best, got alerts.
As the town burned, officials abandoned the phased evacuation and told everyone to get out, Broshears said.
“We felt we morally couldn’t do that and just had to go all out and hope for the best,” said the former Paradise fire chief, who has lived in the town since 1974.
Locals like nurse Darrel Wilken said an old-fashioned siren system would have been better than CodeRED.
“People who are not connected to the internet or phone need to know there is a fire,” said Wilken.

‘PLAN DIDN’T WORK’
Paradise widened, paved and straightened roads after the 2008 blaze to allow for a speedier evacuation. But the Camp Fire burned across all escape routes.
“The flow plan didn’t work,” said Broshears. “We couldn’t flow huge amounts of traffic down an available highway because there was no available highway.”
The fire moved faster than anyone expected, throwing embers that reached 2 miles (3 km) ahead of the flames, Paradise Mayor Jody Jones said.
“I don’t know that there’s a city or town in the entire world that could evacuate their entire population all at the same time and not overwhelm their roadway structure,” Jones told CNN in an interview on Saturday.
On the ground, residents fought to escape the town.
Wilken, 51, got word around 8 a.m. that the fire was 7 miles away. By 8:15 a.m. trees outside his window at the Feather River Hospital were on fire.
There was no time to gather ambulances to evacuate the 67 admitted patients as staff had trained to do.
“If your car was not on fire, you were the ambulance,” said Wilken, who loaded three patients into his Subaru WRX.
His designated escape route was blocked by flames. He wove through back streets and a slalom of burning vehicles, his car exterior melting from the heat, trees and electricity poles falling on vehicles ahead, before reaching safety hours later.
As Wilken fled, firefighters and volunteers including resident Mike Boggs tried to get into town. Police had turned all exit routes into contraflows, a move that sped up the evacuation, but obstructed first responders trying to enter Paradise. Boggs went off road and drove up a ditch in his pickup, followed by a fire truck.
The 60-year-old iron worker credits a decision after the 2008 blaze with saving his and nearby homes in Butte Valley, near Paradise. He bought 40 cattle that grazed on grass that would have otherwise fed the fire.
“Everywhere I put my cows it didn’t burn,” said Boggs.

For Broshears, one of the biggest lesson from the Camp Fire was that residents facing a megafire might sometimes be better off sheltering in open spaces, like road intersections, than trying to outrun flames.

https://citizentv.co.ke/news/we-had-intel-on-westgate-attack-but-failed-to-act-properly-says-dpp-haji-224159/,"Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji has revealed that the country’s intelligence agencies received information about the September 21, 2013 Westgate attack but failed to share and act on it properly.
The DPP, who was then working at the National Intelligence Service (NIS) and was at the mall when the attackers started shooting, made the revelation during an exclusive interview with The Star newspaper published last week.
“The attack taught me a number of things. The first lesson was that all security agencies must work together. In the Westgate case, we had the intel but it was not shared and acted on properly,” said Haji in the interview.
The DPP also narrated how he initially thought the attackers were targeting him because of his role in counter-terrorism programmes and intelligence gathering in Somalia at the time.
He stated that he was, however, able to maintain calm and help others do the same during the ordeal due to his experience working in war-prone areas.
Haji said the attack began when he was at the gents’ and he immediately texted his father – Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji as well as his younger brother Abdul Haji – about the happenings.
His text message read: “I’m stuck at the Westgate. Seems like a terrorist attack. Pray for me.”
The DPP’s brother, Abdul Haji – who has received acclamation for being one of the heroes on that fateful day – previously recounted, in an interview with The Guardian, how he received the message after a meeting at the Yaya Centre.
The younger Haji recalled running down the basement parking, getting into his car and speeding towards Westgate.
“I broke all the traffic rules getting there but I made it.”
DPP Haji added that he hid inside the gents until he smelt teargas which he assumed implied that security forces had arrived on scene.

Given the lifelong expenditure associated with diabetes and its complications, it imposes a significant economic burden on the individuals, families, society, national healthcare systems and countries.
The burgeoning diabetes epidemic could have a profound impact on morbidity and mortality and lead to increased healthcare expenditure. Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent type of diabetes and in India, it is the most important driver of the diabetes epidemic. The rate of undiagnosed diabetes remains high in most developing economies, like India, because of less developed healthcare systems.
There are at least eight different pathophysiological defects in a person with type 2 diabetes. To address each of these defects, newer drugs are becoming available. An example would be the SGLT2 group of drugs which act through the kidney. These drugs not only help in diabetes control but also in reducing weight and blood pressure. They have also been shown to be heart-friendly. However, these newer drugs at relatively higher costs mean that many may not have access to them. The challenge is to make these latest medicines also available to the common man either through subsidy from the government or through other insurance programmes.
There is a need to increase awareness about the rise in diabetes, and its staggering burden and consequences, in developing countries. A large proportion of diabetes cases are preventable. Simple lifestyle measures have been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes. Maintaining normal body weight, engaging in regular physical activity, and eating a healthy diet can reduce the risk of diabetes.
Moreover, even if one has diabetes, it is currently treatable, and its complications can be avoided. Increasing access to diagnosis, self-management education, advanced bio-pharmaceuticals, innovative devices and regularity of treatment are vital components of successful diabetes management.
Efforts to prevent and treat diabetes will be important to achieve the global Sustainable Development Goal 3 target of reducing premature mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by one-third by 2030. Many sectors of society have a role to play, including governments, healthcare experts, educators, manufacturers, civil society, private sector, policy analysts, the media and individuals themselves. A strong advocacy is required for stronger health systems to ensure improved surveillance, enhanced prevention, and more effective management of diabetes.
It must be realised that the price of new innovative drugs and devices reflects the value they bring to patients and society by treating disease more effectively and thereby averting future costs in the healthcare systems. In addition, bringing new drugs and devices to the market is a long and expensive process, often requiring billions of dollars of investment and 10-15 years of preclinical and clinical research.
Affordability can be addressed by expanding public or private insurance coverage or creating a system differential pricing. The latter means that a new drug or device introduced in a lower income market, such as India, can be priced lower than in a higher income market like the US or Japan. However, some policymakers call for price controls on patented, innovative medicines; while this may sound appealing, in the long-term, price controls reduce the incentive to invest in the research and development of new drugs and ultimately reduce patient access to the medicines they need.
To effectively address the management of diabetes in India, we need to find ways to improve the affordability and accessibility of new drugs and medical devices in a way that preserves sustained investment in R&D to bring new treatments, cures and diagnostics to patients who need them.
We need a multifactorial approach involving primary, secondary and tertiary prevention of diabetes and the engagement of multiple stakeholders — patients, healthcare providers, NGOs, the private sector and government. The economic burden of diabetes can be reduced by providing universal health coverage, access to innovative medicines and early detection and treatment of the disorder. This emphasises the need for a multi-pronged strategy to minimise the burden of diabetes and its complications. These measures could help reduce economic costs due to diabetes and related complications.
Stakeholders in the ecosystem should understand that better management of diabetes through improved medication adherence can also lead to improved health outcomes and lower costs for patients. With these tools at our disposal, the time to act is now!

Shriyansh and his brother, Priyansh (9), sons of businessman Rakesh Kumar Agrahari, were allegedly kidnapped on Thursday for a ransom of Rs 50 lakh from outside their school at Katka Bazar in Gosaiganj area of Sultanpur, police said.
On Friday early morning, police arrested four youths, including Rakesh’s domestic help Raghuvar Yadav. After interrogating him, the police recovered Shriyansh’s body in a gunny bag from a rented house at Karaundia locality, around 15 km from Katka Bazaar. Priyansh was found lying in a pool of blood in the same room. He was rushed to KGMU in Lucknow where his condition is reportedly critical, police said.
“The kidnappers had hit the children with a sharp-edged weapon,” said Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Rural, Shiv Raj. The other three accused are Shiv Pujan Rai, Suraj Bahelia and Hari Om alias Shiv Nandan Sharma. All four are in their 20s and are from Gosaiganj area of Sultanpur, the ASP added.
On Friday afternoon, chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited the injured child at the hospital and directed the authorities to ensure proper treatment. The CM also announced Rs 2 lakh for his treatment and an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh for the aggrieved family.
On Thursday morning, Raghuvar left home to drop the children to school which is around two kilometer from their home. Around 11.30 am, Rakesh’s another employee went to bring the children home from school, but couldn’t find them. He immediately informed Rakesh about it. A few hours later, the businessman received a call on his cellphone demanding the ransom, said a police official involved in the probe. Rakesh then contacted the police.
During investigation, the police collected information from the classmates of both the children. “A student told us that Priyansh and Shriyansh left with two persons who appeared to be known to them on a motorcycle. We focused on those people close to Rakesh suspecting role of some insider,” said the official.

“During investigation, we got to know about the house at Karaundia locality where we reached around 4 am today (Friday),” the ASP said.
“All four the accused involved in the incident have been arrested. During questioning, police were told that Raghuvar is the mastermind. He planned it around a month back along with his associates. On Thursday, Suraj and Hariom reached the school on a motorcycle where Raghuvar was already present,” Circle Officer, Jaisinghpur, Lekhraj Singh said.
“The two boys left with Suraj and Hari Om after Raghuvar told them that their father had sent them,” the CO added.","Lucknow: Businessman’s son killed by kidnappers, another child injured; four arrested, says police"

http://www.thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2019/01/20/nigerians-anxious-to-watch-rare-lunar-eclipse/,"Some Nigerians on Sunday said they were anxious to watch the lunar eclipse expected to occur in the early hours of Monday.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that The National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA), on Friday said Nigeria would join other countries of the world to experience a total lunar eclipse on Monday.
The eclipse would start across Nigeria in the early hours of Monday at approximately, 3:36a.m. to reach its maximum at 6:12a.m., and end at about 6:43a.m.
According to NASRDA, “Lunar eclipse occurs only when the sun, earth and moon are exactly aligned with the earth between the two.
Some Nigerians, who spoke with NAN expressed their anxiousnes to watch it, adding that it would be an amazing opportunity.
Mr John Maxwell, a geography teacher, explained that this particular phenomenon was called a super blood wolf moon.
Maxwell said that he learnt that the eclipse would be total with the moon becoming reddish-like blood.
“I also heard that the moon would be closer to the earth than normal, and appear to be slightly bigger and brighter,” he said.
Maxwell said that he had already set his alarm clock to be awake to see the eclipse.
Mrs Mary Lucky, a trader, said that growing up, she used to fill buckets with water to have a clear view of an eclipse.
Lucky said that it had been awhile since she witnessed one, so watching this lunar eclipse would be an opportunity she wouldn’t like to miss.
“I will wake my children to watch, as it is one of God’s wonders and we can’t afford to miss it, “she said.
Mr Mubarak Isah, a civil servant, said that as soon as he heard there would be an eclipse, he did further research on it and discovered that it was a rare one.
“Interestingly, they said that this year’s lunar eclipse is the last of its kind for two years.
“I also heard that it would last for more than an hour; this is really going to be an interesting watch,” he said.
Mr David James, also a civil servant, said that he learnt that anyone who missed watching this particular one would have to wait for two years before seeing another.
James said that though other lunar eclipses would occur, the phenomenon combined to make this particular unique would not happen again till 2021.",Nigerians anxious to watch rare lunar eclipse

https://www.nst.com.my/news/crime-courts/2019/01/446255/vote-recount-tasek-gelugor-seat-fails-materialise,"GEORGE TOWN: Today’s recount of votes for the Tasek Gelugor parliamentary seat, which was won by Barisan Nasional with a razor-thin margin in the 14th General Election, has failed to take place.
Azlina Mehtab Mohd Ishaq, the lawyer representing vanquished candidate Datuk Marzuki Yahya from Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, said the 136 copies of Form 14 of the particular seat will first be scrutinised by the lawyers for all parties involved.
“We will now go back to our clients to seek their advice on the next course of action — whether to proceed with the matter or otherwise.
“There will certainly not be any recount of votes today,” she said when met outside the Auction Room at the High Court building here where the forms were taken in a briefcase.
Form 14 is a document confirming the total number of votes candidates get at each polling station.
The Election Court here on Dec 21 allowed an application for a recount of votes in the Tasek Gelugor parliamentary seat after an election petition was filed by Marzuki, who lost to BN’s Datuk Shabudin Yahya by 81 votes.
Also present today was Mohd Haniff Khatri Abdulla, who is popularly known as Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s lawyer.
Marzuki, who is the deputy foreign minister, had filed the election petition to recount 689 spoilt votes and 297 unreturned (postal) votes for the Tasek Gelugor parliamentary seat.
The petition was dismissed in September and Shabudin has since left BN.
Azlina, however, said they then appealed to the Federal Court, which overturned the decision of the Election Court.
“So, today is fixed for the scrutinising of the Form 14 to enable us to prepare the necessary documentation of the case proceeds for full trial later,” she added.",Vote recount for Tasek Gelugor seat fails to materialise

Many recollected their acquaintance with Mr. Puttappa and shed light on his versatile personality and his contributions as a journalist, activist, writer and politician. Patil Puttappa Centenary Celebrations Reception Committee chairman and senior folklore scholar Go. Ru. Channabasappa said Mr. Puttappa had dedicated a majority of his life to society. Minister for Local Administration C.S. Shivalli said Mr. Puttappa had served society in various capacities. His straight talks and transparent lifestyle had earned him admiration of many. Senior Congress leader Shyamanur Shivashankarappa called him a man of integrity and courage. His analytical skills, subject expertise and narrative capacity helped him carve a niche for himself in society, he said. MLC Basavaraj Horatti, former Minister Vinay Kulkarni, seers Nijagunananda and others also spoke. Members of various organisations felicitated him.In his address Mr. Puttappa recollected memories of the State unification movement of which he was a leading figure. He said more than six decades had elapsed since the formation of the linguistic province of Karnataka, However, the political entity formed unifying Kannada-speaking areas was yet to achieve cultural and mental oneness, he said. The negligence of the northern parts after Independence has resulted in economic and social imbalance. No one wishes to have two States, but if a stepmotherly attitude towards the northern region continues, it is natural that the demand for separate statehood will gain momentum. Those who are at the helm of power should not give scope for such developments, Mr. Puttappa said.

DA LEADER Mmusi Maimane and other party leaders marched through Joburg yesterday to unveil a billboard in the CBD.
However, when he was asked to comment on the high levels of violence in the DA-run Western Cape, Maimane’s response was not clear.
“Murder in this country is far too high. People are being killed everywhere,” he said.
Maimane said the ANC must account for all crimes happening nationally.
“Nationally, the ANC run the police. Whether it’s a child in Nyanga, whether it’s in Soweto, whether it’s farm murders in North West, the police must work hard,” he said.
“We don’t want our people to be killed. This ANC government must account. We are sick and tired of our people’s lives being taken without a government that responds. Today, we reflect on the lives of those who have died and we say, never again. Wherever we are in government, we will continue to fight for honest police to fight for the people.”
Maimane was then asked about ANC NEC member Zizi Kodwa’s tweet, in which he claimed the DA was using ANC’s name to campaign.
“Everything Mmusi says is about the ANC. He can’t finish a sentence without mentioning the ANC,” Kodwa wrote. Maimane at first said: “I don’t respond to Zizi Kodwa.”
When he was pressed to say more, he responded: “Kodwa must explain why the ANC has murdered South Africans. If Zizi wants to be a spokesperson for people who kill our people, he must continue.”",âANCâS MURDERING OUR PEOPLE'

AT&T Inc. reports earnings Wednesday, Jan. 30, 2019. (Alan Diaz, File/Associated Press)
NEW YORK — Wireless and entertainment giant AT&T Inc. on Wednesday reported big subscriber declines in its TV division — even in its much-lauded DirecTV Now streaming service.
AT&T has spent billions in recent years to enter the entertainment business, buying satellite TV company DirecTV and then Time Warner, owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. movie studio.
Its video division is taking some lumps, however. In the fourth quarter, it added to its string of satellite-TV customer losses with 403,000 defections, worse than Wall Street analysts expected. DirecTV Now, the online service pitched as a cable replacement, shed 267,000 customers, the first drop since it launched in November 2016.
AT&T has been rolling back big discounts for DirecTV Now. It had 500,000 customers paying only $10 a month for the service, which hurts its profitability. Many of those customers are leaving as promotions end. In a more positive sign, the number of customers paying full price for the service grew, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said on a call with analysts Wednesday. DirecTV Now starts at $40 a month. It has 1.6 million streaming customers.
In its wireless division, the second-largest in the country after Verizon, AT&T added 134,000 cellphone customers who pay a monthly bill. Those are more lucrative than “prepaid” cellphone customers. But analysts expected more, and “churn,” or the percentage of customers who leave, rose.
Its WarnerMedia division, home to its TV networks and movie studio, got a boost from the box office of films including “A Star is Born” and “Aquaman.”
Shares of the Dallas company slumped 5 percent to $29.17 in late morning trading Wednesday.
Overall, the company posted net income of $4.86 billion, or 66 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 86 cents per share. The average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 85 cents per share.
The telecommunications company posted revenue of $47.99 billion in the period, which fell short of Wall Street forecasts of $48.43 billion.
For the year, the company reported profit of $19.37 billion, or $2.85 per share, on revenue of $170.76 billion.

https://newsghana.com.gh/wa-assemblies-of-god-comforts-tema-murdered-pastors-family/,"The Revival Assembly of the Assemblies of God Church in Wa has expressed its deepest condolences to the family of Rev. Dr. David Nabegmado who was stabbed to death last Sunday in Tema before morning worship.
Dr Nabegmdo was the Senior Pastor of Tema Community Four Assemblies of God Church and was preparing to deliver a sermon that fateful morning when a young man in his thirties stormed his office and stabbed multiple times in between his head and neck, according to police report.
The sad incident threw the entire congregation into a state of mourning with several worshippers describing the late Pastor as a “lovely and caring man” who impacted on several lives in the society and the Church.
Delivering his New Year message, Rev Robert Akolbugri, the Head Pastor of Revival Assemblies of God Church in Wa, described the Pastor’s death as “tragic”, and asked God to keep his family safe.
“I also express my heartfelt condolence to the family of the late Revered Dr. David Nabegmado who passed due to tragic circumstances,” he said, “God keep the family”.
The Revival Assembly seeks to operate on the theme: “My Year of divine Increase,” for the year 2019, drawing from Genesis 26:12 in line with bearing the fruit of the spirit.
The Church anticipates to do more to prosecute its mission, Rev Akolbugri said: “We would launch up to the deep area in the Upper West Region where the Gospel has not been heard.
“We would like to rescue souls that are perishing and also work on the spiritual growth of individual members of the Church”.
He said it was unfortunate that the country was still “riddled with corrupt practices in offices and homes” even though majority of the people in Ghana remained Christians.
“It is very sad that honesty has been thrown to the dogs in our moral fabric,” he said.
He urged members of the church to be honest in all their dealings, saying: “No short cut or underhand dealings”.
“Let us make it a point not be worried about who would apprehend or catch me but instead look up to God who sees you at all places and do the right thing”.
The grace of God upon the church is stronger and mightier to do good works both in the physical and the spiritual.
The Head Pastor also urged members to be responsible citizens and keep the environment safe especially during this harmattan season and eschew bush burning.
“Keep our surroundings clean. Remember cleanliness is next to Godliness,” he added.
Members of the Church were encouraged to begin with something new and should not be deterred by what did not work for them in the previous year.
“Start afresh and God would crown every small beginning with good success,” he said.

The call follows last Friday's incident in Kanyinya Sector of Nyarugenge District where a man killed his wife over internal wrangles.
The RNP spokesperson, Commissioner of Police (CP) John Bosco Kabera, said that the suspect, Silvestre Bavugayabo, was arrested this Sunday in Rweya Village, Rutonde Cell of Shyorongi Sector in Rulindo District.
On the fateful night of January 11, at about 1am, Bavugayabo, 38, allegedly killed one Angelique Nyirabenda whom he was cohabiting with.
""Following the gruesome murder, the search for the suspect was launched. On January 13, we received information that he was hiding in Rulindo, he was trailed in Rweya Village and was intercepted as he tried to cross to Kamonyi District by boat through Nyabarongo River,"" Kabera said.
He added; ""However, Bavugayabo became violent, resisted arrest and tried to flee; he was shot and he succumbed to injuries.""
He appealed to the general public to always report conflicts in their neighbourhoods so as to address them before turning violent.
""If you can't resolve your differences amicably, there are local leaders, Police and other entities in the justice sector. All these are there to ensure that your misunderstandings are addressed and to prevent violence or bloodshed, and the innocent becoming the criminal,” Kabera said.
He also appealed to the public to always cooperate and refrain from being violent during the process of justice.

https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20190128/dg-foundation-shines-light-majesty-gardens,"Popularly known as ‘Back-To’ in Majesty Gardens, Kingston, is often dismissed as a volatile community with few opportunities for its residents. Working to change that reality is the Majesty Gardens Youth and Sports Club (MGYSC), which is focusing on community development and youth empowerment. With support from corporate entities like the Desnoes and Geddes (D&G) Foundation, the club is getting ready to embark on an improvement project which will benefit scores of young people in the community.
“Knowing that the community is prone to crime and violence, we want to engage the youths in constructive activities. So we provide skills training, scholarship opportunities, homework programmes and computer classes. We have also developed a robust sporting programme that allows community members to participate in football, basketball, cricket and netball . We look forward to expanding these activities so that we can reach more young people,” said Paul Williams, founder and president of the community group.
Williams pointed to plans to install a new lighting system for the club grounds as well as the refurbishment of the perimeter fence for the multipurpose court, and noted its potential impact.“This will make a huge difference. We are happy that more than 200 young people have already benefited from activities carried out by the club; and we know once the work is completed, it will be even better,” said Williams.
The planned project will be done with the help of the D&G Foundation through a donation of $100,000 as part of the company’s ‘100 For A Century’ centennial campaign launched in 2018. The MGYSC was among 56 beneficiaries, selected through a partnership with The Gleaner, who received a share of the $5.6-million pool of funds.
“Community upliftment is one of the pillars on which the D&G Foundation stands, and achieving that goal through sports and academics is a creative and sustainable way to do that. We believe that these avenues can create countless opportunities for the youth of Majesty Gardens, so we are happy to support them in whatever area they need so they can expand their reach,” noted Dianne Ashton-Smith, board member of the D&G Foundation.

This first phase of the improvement project is set to be completed by March of this year. Majesty Gardens residents can now look forward to feeling safer and more secure on the club grounds as persons will not be able to wander on to the property during club activities. The upgrades will also enhance the aesthetics of the community and help to m,ake it feel more like a haven in the neighbourhood.
“Investing in our sports programme has also paid off, as the club’s basketball team experienced a successful year, most notably winning the 2018 Southern Conference League. Not only was winning a big deal for everyone in the club, but also the fact that the team was given the opportunity to play one of the final games in Jamaica. We are currently preparing for the National Basketball League,” said Williams.
Among the team members is 26-year-old Renford Rookwood, who has been playing basketball with the MGYSC since he was a teenager as a means to keep away from the violence in the community. Committing to the sport has given him invaluable exposure and training opportunities.
“Basketball has helped me to establish and focus on my goals, make friends and stay out of trouble,” said Rookwood. “Through the sport, I got a scholarship to play for the Hydel Group of Schools, so it was an added bonus being able to play a sport I love while getting a high-school education. It is not always easy living in Majesty Gardens, but thanks to the club, I have valuable experiences in basketball and I look forward to travelling and playing internationally.”
Established in 2001, the MGYSC has made strides in influencing positive change among the youth in the community. With more plans to extend the reach of the organisation, Williams looks forward to inspiring more young people as they create brighter hopes for the neighbourhood.",D&G Foundation shines light on Majesty Gardens

https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/europe-wonders-whether-to-bring-back-children-raised-under-isis,"RANST, BELGIUM (WASHINGTON POST) - The children's voices crackled through the phone and into Fatiha's grey-walled living room.
""When are we going to grandma's?"" one implored in the background, and then into the phone: ""Are you coming to get us?""
In the hallway, six coat hooks were fixed in a row at child's height. A backpack hung on each one. Up a steep stairway, sheets with characters from Pixar's ""Cars"" were carefully tucked into bunk beds, awaiting the children's return.
But Fatiha, a Belgian whose grandparents emigrated from Morocco, didn't know when her six grandchildren - who range in age from 10 months to seven years - would be back. They are among the hundreds of children born to European citizens who went to fight for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
Now that the caliphate has collapsed, and the planned US withdrawal has compounded regional instability, grandparents across Europe are pushing to save children who in some cases they've seen only in photos, looking up at them from the dusty desert floor.
""We're waiting for them, everything is ready for them,"" Fatiha, 46, said in an interview at her home outside Antwerp, in a bucolic village where backyards give way to hayfields.
The children's fathers are dead, and their mothers - Fatiha's daughter and daughter-in-law - would face prison sentences if they return to Belgium.
So Fatiha has prepared to care for the children herself. To protect her grandchildren, she spoke on the condition that her last name not be published.
For Belgium, France and other countries that saw some of their nationals gravitate towards ISIS territory as it expanded across Syria and Iraq, the plight of children who have claims to citizenship has ignited questions that would test the most Solomonic of judges.
Governments are grappling with how much responsibility they bear for the safety of these small citizens, most of them younger than six, in a region where fresh conflict could erupt.
Courts are weighing whether the rights of the children extend to returning with their ISIS parents. And a bitter public debate is underway about whether grandparents whose own children ran away to the ISIS can be trusted to raise a new generation differently.
The Kurdish authorities who control the territory in north-eastern Syria where many of these families ended up estimate they have more than 1,300 children in their refugee and prison camps.
Russia repatriated 27 children last week. France is considering bringing back more than 100 fighters - who would face trial - and their families.
But until now, most governments have calculated that the political downside of retrieving parents who may pose security risks outweighs any need to bring back the children.
In Fatiha's case, a judge ruled that Belgium must repatriate her six grandchildren, along with her daughter and her daughter-in-law - Belgian citizens who joined the ISIS and now want to come back.
The two women were convicted in absentia of joining a terrorist organisation and would each face a five-year prison sentence upon their arrival on Belgian soil. But the judge ruled that bringing the children home and leaving their mothers in Syria would violate the children's human rights.
The Dec 26 ruling has spurred a furious response from Belgian leaders, and the government plans to appeal in court on Wednesday (Feb 20). The authorities expect whatever precedent is set to affect decisions about other ISIS families.
At least 22 Belgian children are in Syrian camps, and more than 160 are believed to be in the conflict zone.
The most vociferous objections relate to the return of the parents.
""We won't punish young children for their parents' misdeeds,"" Belgium's migration secretary, Maggie De Block, said in a statement last month.
""They have not chosen the ISIS. That is why we want to make efforts to bring them back to our country. For the parents, the situation is different. They themselves have deliberately chosen to turn their backs on our country and even to fight against it. Repeatedly.""
""Solidarity has its limits,"" she said. ""The freedom you enjoy in our country to make your own decisions also means you bear responsibility for the consequences.""
Spokesmen for De Block, the Justice Ministry and Belgium's prime minister all declined to comment for this report. They would not confirm whether the government was paying the judge's prescribed penalty of €5,000 per child per day if they weren't returned by Feb 4.
Even for the children, Belgian sympathy goes only so far. Many people are anxious.
Belgium contributed the largest number of ISIS fighters to Syria per capita of any European Union nation, and the country remains scarred by the attacks of 2016, when Belgian citizens with ISIS connections targeted Brussels with deadly bombings.
Discussions on talk shows and in editorial pages have stoked fear about what the children may have learnt from their parents or from ISIS training camps, which targeted children as young as six for indoctrination - although little evidence exists that any of the Belgians were exposed.
Belgium needs to protect ""these children as well as our children, and to protect the parents of our children"", said Nadia Sminate, a lawmaker in the regional Parliament for the Dutch-speaking north of Belgium who has been a vocal critic of plans to bring back the children.
""These children have been raised with different values and norms than our children. We don't have to be silly about that. They've seen the cruellest things in the world.""
When Fatiha needs to cheer herself up, she plays a video her daughter sent last summer of her grandchildren raucously singing ""Heads, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"" in Dutch - their first and only language.
Her days are a blur of frustration.
A visit from the police, interviewing her yet again to determine whether she would raise the grandchildren in a radicalised home. A phone call with her lawyer, who is battling the Belgian government to carry out the judge's order.
A rattling train trip to Brussels alongside other grandmothers who are pushing policymakers to repatriate their toddlers. An anxious Internet search of prison conditions in Deir Ezzour, Syria, where she was worried her daughter, daughter-in-law and grandchildren had been taken after they dropped out of contact for more than two weeks last month.
When they resurfaced, they reported that Kurdish authorities had blindfolded them and transferred them not to Deir Ezzour, but to a more brutal camp than they'd been in previously.
One of Fatiha's grandsons has chronic diarrhoea, and now he has only a single pair of pants, his mother said. Another has asthma, but no medicine.
""Everything keeps getting worse,"" Fatiha's daughter, Bouchra Abouallal, 25, said in an interview with The Washington Post via a messaging service. ""I keep telling the children, 'Don't be afraid. Nothing is going to happen.' But they're not stupid anymore.""
After the December court order, ""we told our children, 'We're almost home. We'll be there in a month,' "" Abouallal said, her voice cracking. A boy's voice interrupted. ""Why are you crying?"" ""It's now they who are calming me down, not the other way around,"" Abouallal told The Post.
By Fatiha's account, her family's problems started with her 2009 divorce from her children's father, which sent them searching elsewhere for support.
The family had worn its faith lightly. Fatiha said they practised ""modern Islam."" But her eldest son, Noureddine Abouallal, fell in with an Antwerp group called Sharia4Belgium - which would later be connected to 2015 and 2016 terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels.
Noureddine Abouallal shaved his head and grew a beard. He and his wife - Tatiana Wielandt, who converted to Islam to marry him in 2010 - marked their son's birth with an announcement that included images of a fighter and a gun.
Bouchra Abouallal and her husband also joined Sharia4Belgium.
In 2013, when eager adherents of jihadism were streaming towards the fighting, the two couples went with their babies to Syria. The men were killed within a year. Abouallal and Wielandt - each pregnant with her dead husband's child, and each with an older son in tow - returned to Belgium in 2014. The state didn't seek to prosecute them then.
Fatiha said she was furious that they had run away, but she let them back in her life. Abouallal and Wielandt crammed into a bunk bed. Two baby boys were born. Their toddler sons settled in at a school two doors down.
Once, at a backyard barbecue, one grandson dived under a table as a plane flew overhead - perhaps a reaction ingrained from bombings. But otherwise the boys showed little evidence of what they had been through, Fatiha said.
Then, one day in 2015, they all disappeared, leaving Fatiha with a house full of toys and a child-sized Nutella handprint on the door to the backyard. ""I felt like I was stabbed in my back. I felt like I didn't want to have anything to do with them,"" she said. She left the handprint.
In the end, she said, she decided it was better to keep in touch. The young women made it with their children to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa. They remarried, but their second husbands were killed around the time Wielandt gave birth to her third child.
After Western forces bombarded the city into submission in late 2017, they fled into Kurdish-controlled territory and eventually to the al-Hol camp in north-eastern Syria.
Her daughter and daughter-in-law ask Fatiha for reminders about what Belgian primary schools teach, so they can try to replicate the lessons. In video clips, the kids show off their somersaults and tumbling.
Recently, Abouallal sent a video of Fatiha's newest granddaughter, born last April, wearing her first headband and plucking at the unfamiliar white elastic as it slipped over her eyes.""I told them I want to see everything as they grow up,"" Fatiha said. ""I don't want to miss a thing.""
But as the Belgian government stalls, and as the security situation in Syria becomes increasingly uncertain, Fatiha and the other grandmothers are growing embittered.
Nabila Mazouz - whose son was caught at the airport as he tried to make his way to Syria - started a support group called Mothers' Jihad to help fight for the return of Belgians who spent time in the caliphate. ""I understand the government. I understand the security issues,"" Mazouz said.
""But I guarantee they're going to come back, and if they come back in 15 to 20 years, what kind of mood are they going to come back in?""
She said that after being repeatedly spurned by Belgian authorities, she now better understands her son's disaffection. ""I never asked myself, 'Am I Moroccan or Belgian?' I said I was Belgian,"" she said. ""I was born here. I work here. I pay my taxes here. But now I ask myself. Now the parents understand the perspective of the young adults.""
Advocates for the children in Syria have been targeted with bile.
""Normally, everybody likes what we do,"" said Heidi De Pauw, the director of Child Focus, a Belgian organisation that is modelled on the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in the United States.
But for pressing Belgian authorities on this case, she has received death threats and been told that the children should be ""drowned like kittens."" De Pauw and others say the children should not be condemned because their parents made bad decisions.
One psychologist who traveled to Syria in October to assess Belgian children in the camps, including Fatiha's grandchildren, said despite everything they have been through, their play and development were relatively normal.
""We were really surprised about how these children were doing,"" said Gerrit Loots, a child psychologist at the Free University of Brussels. ""Once these children have adapted, they can go to school, they can be with others.""
Loots said his greatest concern was how attached the children were to their mothers. ""They've never spent a day apart,"" he noted. He said taking the children back to Belgium without their mothers would be ""psychologically disastrous.""
Bringing them all back together, even assuming the mothers go straight to prison, would be easier to manage, Loots concluded.
The mothers say they want to return, but they are ready to stay behind in Syria if that's the cost of getting their children back to Belgium and safety.
""I have no problem with that,"" Abouallal said. ""I just want my children to have a secure life, and have a normal life, and that they don't punish them for the mistakes we've made.""
Fatiha sucked in her breath, then dabbed a tear, as her daughter described conditions in their new camp.
""Try to keep them busy,"" Fatiha urged her daughter. ""Tell them a story.""
""I love you,"" the grandmother told them all, before she hung up the phone and slumped into her couch.",Europe wonders whether to bring back children raised under ISIS

Birthday boy Marcelo Felipe of 7/11 Cliqq — Air21 by RoadBike Philippines won the shortest stage in two hours, 40 minutes and 19 seconds, outsprinting second and third placers El Joshua Cariño (2:40:19) of Philippine Navy — Standard Insurance and Jonel Carcueva (2:40:23) of Go For Gold.
But it didn’t come easy as the Filipino trio had to break away from a large 72-man peloton. They were behind the three-man group of Navy’s Junrey Navarra, Team Franzia’s Ryan Tugawin and Go For Gold’s Ishmael Grospe which led for the most parts of the race.
Gaining momentum, the three cyclists then seized the driver seat 25 kilometers into the Provincial Capitol finish line before Felipe and Cariño went full swing and left Carcueva behind in the last 10 kilometers.
The last 10 kilometers became a two-man race with the 7/11 bet winning just by a hairline.
There was nothing more satisfying for Felipel, though, other than the stage podium sweep of the Filipinos in the Mango Capital of the Philippines.
“El Joshua, Jonel and I had it planned once we took the lead. We agreed to help one another — even if we’re from different clubs — just to secure this stage win for the Filipinos,” said the Nueva Ecija pride Felipe who turned 29-years old.
“The peloton was just behind us and we’re racing against the wind. That’s why we decided to work together because if we didn’t, we would have been caught in the front. After all, we’re all Filipinos and that’s all that mattered with this win.”
Daeyeong Joo of Team Korail from Korea and reigning champion Ronald Oranza of Philippine Navy finished at fourth and fifth places, respectively, with identical times of 2:40:33.
Completing the top 10 Stage Two finishers were former back-to-back Ronda winner Jan Paul Morales of Navy, Mohd Harrif Saleh of Terengganu TSG cyling team form Malaysia, Jamalidin Novardianto of PGN team from Indonesia, Kangeun Joo of Korail and Arjay Peralta of 7/11.

According to Nograles, the DOH had been directed to pursue a “more aggressive action” on. The Presidential Communications Operations Office, on the other hand, was also tapped to boost its communication efforts to instill anew the importance of vaccination, aiding the DOH with information dissemination. However, Nograles admitted that aside from the national government and its agencies, the LGUs also played an important role in terms of actions, accountability, and contribution to the immunization. “All we need to do is to step up the drive, the DOH has to step up its drive and involve the local government units… I think the LGUs play a very critical and important part in this immunization program and other programs of government,” he told a Palace press briefing Friday. He also said the directives for the DOH to step up the information drive were consistent with the provisions of the Mandatory Infants and Children Health Immunization Act of 2011. Under Section 4 of the law, “The DOH, other government agencies, non-government organizations, professional and academic societies, and local government units shall make available appropriate information materials and shall have a system of its distribution to the public.” “So, it’s clear in the law that we need to mobilize the entire government machinery, as well as our partners in the health sector, to inform the public that immunization is provided for free by the government, that it is safe, and that this is needed to protect the lives and health of children all over the country,” he stressed. “This is the only way to address the current measles outbreak, abate its spread in more areas, and prevent the occurrence of another one in the future.” He then assured the public that the government would “exert all efforts” to ensure the proper implementation of RA 10152 amid the increase in. “The Duterte administration recognizes that this is a public health issue that needs to be urgently addressed. That’s why we are focused on ensuring that the provisions of RA 10152 are properly implemented,” he said. READ: Measles outbreak in Metro Manila, Luzon Nograles, however, noted that the government could not force parents to have their children immunized, nor punish them for not having their children vaccinated. “RA 10152 does not have any penal provisions. It also does not punish parents who do not have their children vaccinated, unlike the PD (presidential decree) it replaced. Under PD 996, it was the duty of parents or those having custody of the child to see to it that the child is immunized. Those who did not could be punished with a 200-peso fine or one-month imprisonment,” explained Nograles. According to Section 3 of the RA 10152, the government must provide free immunization to infants and children up to five years of age at any government hospital or health center. Under the law, all infants and children must undergo mandatory basic immunization covering measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases such as Tuberculosis, Diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, Poliomyelitis, Mumps, Rubella or German measles; Hepatitis-B, and Haemophilus Influenzae type B.

Addressing a gathering at Bardoli in Surat, Gujarat Tribal Development Minister Ganpat Vasava said Gandhi’s “Shiva reincarnation” can be considered true only if he survives after having “500 grams of poison”.
“People from the Congress claim Rahul Gandhi is an avatar of Lord Shiva. Now, since Lord Shiva used to consume poison to save people, I want Congress workers to make their leader drink 500 grams of poison,” Vasava said.
“If he survives like Lord Shiva after consuming poison, we will all believe he is the true reincarnation of Lord Shiva” Vasava claimed.
The BJP minister’s Shiva jibe incensed the Congress which called it “extremely unfortunate” and reflective of that party’s “true character” and stemming from the fear of poll defeat.
“Such comments about our leader are extremely unfortunate. This shows the true character of BJP and its leaders. They are making such statements out of frustration as they are seeing defeat in the Lok Sabha polls,” Gujarat Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said.
Vasava had earlier this month taken a swipe at the Congress over its demand for proof of India’s February 26 Balakot air strike by suggesting that a camera-wielding party leader be tied to a fighter jet to record such aerial action in future.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 24 — Several members of the Public Account Committee (PAC) have confirmed that they have sent a letter to Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad airing their uneasiness over retaining Datuk Seri Ronald Kiandee as PAC chairman.
Kiandee, who defected to Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) from Umno, has left government lawmakers divided over his post as the PAC chairman as ruling coalition Pakatan Harapan (PH) had stated in its manifesto that members of the Opposition should helm the post.
Speaking to Malay Mail, PAC member and Subang MP Wong Chen said members of the committee are now waiting for feedback from the prime minister on their letter.
“Members of the PAC have signed a letter that detailed our unhappiness over the issue. We are waiting for his reply before any other steps are taken.
“But the PAC is in the middle of running investigations so for many of us, we would like to see those resolved first before we make any decision on our part,” he told Malay Mail.
“We are not happy that Ronald is the PAC chairman because for the first time, in a very long time, we have both the chairman and deputy chairman from the government,” he added.
Wong said that the current situation went against the norm. However, he admitted that many PAC members prefer to finish their ongoing investigations.
“Because in the old administration, the deputy post was always offered to the Opposition. So this is not a long-term, tenable situation, having said that we have hearings that are already into their fourth month.
“Nurul Izzah came in a bit later so it’s OK for her. But for many of us, who have been here since day one, it is really hard for us to abandon things midway, so we will see things through and wait for a response from the prime minister,” he said, while referring to Permatang Pauh MP Nurul Izzah Anwar who announced her resignation from the committee.
Earlier this week, Nurul Izzah and Segambut MP Hannah Yeoh protested against retaining Kiandee as chairman rafter he defected to Bersatu recently. Both insisted that the PAC must be headed by an Opposition MP.
Deputy Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister Sim Tze Tzin also reportedly urged Kiandee to “do the right thing” and resign.
Commenting on Nurul Izzah’s departure from the PAC, Wong said he was sad to see her go but it was ultimately her own decision.
“Of course, I respect her decision. However, to put things at ease, no, I will not resign from the PAC,” he said, stating further that someone has to do the job.
Another PAC member, Kluang MP Wong Shu Qi said she also respects Nurul Izzah’s decision to quit the committee; however, she pointed out that the PAC can still function as an effective committee even without the top post being held by an Opposition lawmaker.
Relating her experience on visiting the Australian Parliament last October, Shu Qi said Malaysia is among the few countries that decided to put an Opposition MP as the leader of the PAC.
“None of the other countries, even developed countries, for example, the UK, Australia or even New Zealand have such an arrangement.
“But then, in terms of prevention of corruption and institutional checks and balance sand so on, they are still far better than us, so it is not merely about the PAC. There are still other ways to conduct institutional reforms as well,” she said.
Shu Qi said the PAC, in whatever the configuration or capacity, must operate in a bipartisan and impartial manner to ensure proper checks and balances.",PAC members say ball in PM’s court over retaining Kiandee as chief

https://www.firstpost.com/news-analysis/tiktok-ban-the-case-highlighted-the-inability-of-indian-laws-to-prevent-the-exploitation-of-children-6536221.html,"We need to take a holistic approach to kids' safety, and a law that addresses this would be welcome. The ban imposed by the Madras High Court on the immensely popular app TikTok was lifted last week, though the app is yet to be available again on app stores. While the ban itself had raised concerns for content regulation in India, making the Court’s decision to lift it a welcome one, a persisting issue is the vulnerability of children online. This is an issue that the TikTok ban brought to the fore, and a concern which the Court reiterated even as it lifted the ban.
In particular, the case exposed the weaknesses in Indian laws towards safeguarding children online. To remedy this, the Court had suggested the enactment of an act along the lines of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 1998, known as COPPA, of the US. Looking at the current laws in India as well as the upcoming Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018, in the context of TikTok’s case, it is clear that not just a privacy law, but an approach that protects children online as a whole is very much required.
Vulnerabilities highlighted by the TikTok case
The TikTok case brought into focus certain vulnerabilities in Indian law, pointing to the need to strengthen not just privacy law but also intermediary law in this context. For instance, an issue that emerged was, firstly, the need to impose an obligation on intermediaries to prevent the exposure of children to certain types of content, such as pornographic content. This is an obligation which a privacy law like the PDP Bill does not impose. The Information Technology Act, 2000 does impose an obligation to take down content and exercise due diligence but does not have sufficient specific provisions for children’s safety.
For instance, a second issue in the TikTok incident was that BBC investigations against TikTok in the UK had pointed out that while TikTok took down harmful content, it failed to act against the users uploading it in the first place. The inaction meant that though the content was removed, other children continue to be exposed to possible paedophiles. Under Indian law, through intermediaries have a right to suspend such accounts under the IT (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011, this is not in the form of an enforceable obligation.
Yet another issue the case brought out is the need to prevent/restrict the interaction of children with strangers, another obligation that is missing under the PDP Bill or any other Indian law at present.
Children’s laws traditionally require more responsibility
Notably, safe harbour for intermediaries has been provided due to the sheer volume of content that they deal with and the difficulty in addressing all issues instantly. Intermediaries, further, are not expected to perform judicial functions in relation to the content they host. Now, intermediary liability in itself is changing, but in the case of children, even traditionally, laws impose a lot more liability.
Section 67B of the IT Act, for instance, which deals with child pornography, prohibits not only sharing but also the viewing and the creation of such content (for general pornographic content, only sharing is prohibited). Section 67B also specifically punishes acts like sexual grooming or child abuse online.
Intermediaries like TikTok, however, are protected under Section 79, with only an obligation to take down content on receiving a police/governmental order to do so. There are no enhanced obligations on intermediaries in case of the discovery or suspicion of a paedophile online. The Protection of Children against Sexual Offences Act, 2012, for instance, punishes a failure to report an instance of child abuse, but there is no clarity about whether this provision applies to intermediaries as well.
Borrowing COPPA’s conditional safe harbour for holistic safety
A privacy law like the COPPA can only address some of these issues. Intermediary liability is an equally serious issue here. What is needed perhaps, is not specifically a law that protects privacy, but a law that holistically deals with the safety of children online.
Features from COPPA can certainly be borrowed for this. For instance, COPPA adopts a safe harbour approach where intermediaries are allowed to self-regulate, and safe harbour is accorded on the adoption of adequate measures for children’s privacy. Such conditional safe harbour could be adopted for the holistic safety of children online in India as well.
The advantage of conditional safe harbour
The advantage of the conditional safe harbour is, firstly, that the self-regulatory mechanism allows the adoption of norms specific to issues that arise with the specific intermediary. TikTok’s concern with interaction with strangers is different from, say, Netflix’s concern with accessibility of content by children, or even PUBG’s concern like causing addiction in them. The measures that each site would need would be different.
Secondly, the law will lay down certain basic norms, thus setting a minimum standard that intermediaries will need to meet. This could include, for instance, an obligation to remove content immediately, instead of waiting for a court order, and an obligation to suspend the accounts of suspected paedophiles, abusers, etc. This should, of course, be backed up with proper and quick recourse to the user as well, to deal with mistaken or false allegations as well. Another obligation would be of mandating the reporting of abusive and other content in relation to children, along the lines of the requirement under the POSCO Act.
Uniform restrictions can impose an unfair regulatory burden on different types of or smaller companies while a flexible approach will prevent this and not hamper innovation. Many critics of COPPA, for instance, argue that when a high regulatory burden is imposed in relation to children, companies deal with it by simply barring children below a certain age (in the case of COPPA, 13 years) from using the site. This is an easy way out since the companies escape liability under the law and the costs of compliance. Children, however, tend to find their way around such restrictions simply by lying about their age or even getting their parents to do so. Flexibility would allow companies to devise a method that works for them, while the minimum standards would prevent avoidance of responsibility.
PDP Bill and some changes needed
That is not to say that the specific provisions on privacy for children are not an important step towards children’s safety online. Section 23 of the PDP Bill, in fact, requires parental consent for processing the data of all children below the age of 18 years. The provisions proposed here, however, fall short.
The PDP Bill, for instance, does propose restrictions on profiling, tracking and targeted advertising in relation to children’s data. These, however, are to apply only to ‘guardian data fiduciaries’, which refers to data fiduciaries which will be identified as such, if they direct services at children or if they process large volumes of data on children. A bigger issue that this brings out is that while the law aims to protect children, the safety it ensures appears to be aimed at preventing violations at an organizational level, while children’s safety needs more protections at an individual level.
Consider, for instance, provisions of the kidSAFE+ Certification, a COPPA approved safe harbour certification. This includes provisions such as requiring verifiable parental consent specifically for:
Features allowing sharing of information in a public setting or with other users (e.g., chat, in game-messaging, community features, etc.)
Send-to-friend features that allow the sharing of information
Granting access to third-party plugins that take information, etc.
This indicates, for instance, how a privacy law like the PDP Bill can be used to prevent children from interacting with strangers, as had emerged in the case of TikTok.
Taking a holistic approach to children’s safety online
On the whole, a holistic approach to children’s safety is required, and a law that addresses this would be very welcome. It is hoped that the government will act on the Madras High Court’s directions and consider enacting such a law.

https://www.euronews.com/2019/04/04/pilots-of-doomed-ethiopian-airlines-flight-struggled-for-control-as-planes-nose-dipped-report,"By Jason Neely and Eric M. Johnson
ADDISABABA/SEATTLE (Reuters) – Faulty sensor readings and multiple automatic commands to push down the nose of a Boeing plane contributed to last month’s fatal crash in Ethiopia, leaving the crew struggling to regain control, according to a preliminary accident report.
The first substantial account of the last minutes of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 from Addis Ababa to Nairobi on March 10 described how the captain three times called out: “Pull up” and was acknowledged by the first officer, but to no avail.
Boeing’s top-selling aircraft, the 787 MAX, has been grounded worldwide since the March 10 disaster, which killed 157 people and came just five months after a Lion Air crash in Indonesia that killed 189 in a plane of the same model.
Families of the victims, regulators and travellers around the world have been waiting for signs of whether the two crashes are linked, and the extent to which Boeing technology and the actions of the Ethiopian Airlines pilots played a role.
The doomed flight crashed six minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa in clear conditions. “Most of the wreckage was found buried in the ground,” said the report by the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority’s Accident Prevention and Investigation Bureau published on Thursday.
It recommended that Boeing review its flight-control systems and that regulators properly verify the review.
Ethiopian Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges told a news conference in the Ethiopian capital the crew had performed all the procedures recommended by Boeing, but safety experts said this was likely to spark debate with U.S. regulators and Boeing.
Boeing said its coming software fix for the anti-stall system that pushes down the plane’s nose would give pilots the authority to always override the system if activated by faulty sensor data.
“I’d like to reiterate our deepest sympathies are with the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in the accident,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and Chief Executive Kevin McAllister.
“We will carefully review the AIB’s preliminary report, and will take any and all additional steps necessary to enhance the safety of our aircraft.”
QUESTIONSRAISED
The report leaves unanswered questions, some experts said, such as why the plane’s trajectory did not respond to pilot and automatic commands including two final nose up commands from the pilots about 30 seconds before the plane crashed.
“Those should literally follow each other,” said one U.S.-based expert, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. “I think this is a more complex problem than what we initially thought.”
Questions have also been raised over whether crew followed guidance not to restore power to a troublesome anti-stall system following the sensor damage, possibly caused by a bird strike. The plane was also set to unusually high thrust, data suggested.
A final report by Ethiopian authorities aided by air-safety experts from the United States and Europe is due to be published within a year.
Some pilots expressed disquiet that following Boeing’s checklist for the malfunction had not appeared to work.
“If the preliminary report from the Ethiopian authorities is accurate, the pilots quickly identified the malfunction and applied the manufacturer’s checklist. Following this checklist did not appear to allow the pilots to regain control of the aircraft,” said Captain Jason Goldberg, spokesman for Allied Pilots Association, which represents American Airlines pilots.
The Federal Aviation Administration, which has come under fire over the way it decided to certify the plane and its so-called MCAS anti-stall software, cautioned the investigation had not yet concluded.
“We continue to work towards a full understanding of all aspects of this accident. As we learn more about the accident and findings become available, we will take appropriate action,” the U.S. agency said in a statement.
Southwest Airlines Co and American Airlines Group Inc, the two largest U.S. operators of the MAX with 34 and 24 jets respectively and dozens more on order, each said on Thursday that they continued to await guidance from U.S. regulators and Boeing on when the MAX could resume flying.
Ethiopian investigators did not blame anyone for the crash, stressing the importance of international rules requiring civil probes to focus on recommendations for safer flight.
Most accidents take months of analysis because of the need to trace backwards to find a root cause from tangled evidence.
“There is a big difference between having the data and knowing the cause,” a senior European investigator said.
Officials denied reports of tensions between Ethiopian officials and U.S. and other foreign investigators accredited to the probe.
“We don’t have any reservations from different stakeholders who were engaged in the investigations,” chief investigator Amdye Ayalew Fanta said.
Following a previous Ethiopian Airlines accident off Beirut in 2010, Addis Ababa authorities rejected the conclusions of a Lebanese investigation citing pilot error and suggested the aircraft had exploded in a possible act of sabotage.
Aviation safety analyst Paul Hayes said deeper investigation would delve into the role played by software and how pilots were able to respond, and said he hoped scars from the 2010 dispute would not get in the way of a comprehensive investigation.
“Pilots shouldn’t have to cope with such an emergency situation. We need to understand what are the factors that meant these two crews were overcome,” said Hayes, safety director at UK-based consultancy Flight Ascend.
“It is unusual for there to be a single cause,” he added.

Jet’s competitors in the country are lapping up its vacated slots at key airports like Mumbai.

The board of the airline will meet on Tuesday to assess the current situation and the way forward in the wake of cancellation of flights and grounding of aircraft due to cash crunch. In an internal communication, Jet Airways chief executive Vinay Dube said the lenders could not decide on the emergency funding and that the board of the airline will meet on Tuesday to take a call on the future.
“As you are aware, we have been working with the lenders to secure interim funding for our operations. The interim funding has not been forthcoming thus far, and as a result we have extended cancellation of international operations until April 18,” he noted.
“The current status of our engagement with the lenders and other related matters shall be placed before the board tomorrow morning, where the management will seek guidance from the board on the next steps forward. We will keep you updated on all critical developments,” Dube said in the mail.
In a statement, State Bank of India, which is the lead banker in the consortium of lenders, said that the bid process for “orderly sale” of equity in the airline is currently being run by SBICAPs and was being vetted by the legal team. “The prospective bidders will be shortlisted by SBICAPs shortly,” an SBI spokesperson said. “The proposed equity conversion by banks, if any, will be undertaken as a transitory mechanism to facilitate the bidding cum sale process. “SBI is acting on behalf of the group of lenders as part of the Bank Led Resolution Process,” he said. “Necessary support to facilitate the process is being extended by the banks in the consortium. Cooperation by and support from all the other stakeholders will be the key to the success of the process,” the spokesperson said.

The SBI statement, however, did not disclose details about the fund infusion promised by the bankers.
On March 25, as part of the bailout plan worked out by the lenders, Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal stepped down from the board. The airline was supposed to create appropriate security over the company’s assets for securing the existing facilities extended by the lenders and the proposed immediate funding support of up to Rs 1,500 crore by way of an appropriate debt instrument.
“Banks are unlikely to chip in funds with more funds unless adequate security cover is provided by the airline. Unfortunately, the process of sale of stake held by banks is taking time … there’s no chance of a new investor or promoter coming in the near future,” said an institutional source. Bankers had earlier said the interim financing of Rs 1,500 crore would have been adequate for a two-month period.

Meanwhile, news agency PTI reported that the airline’s pilots union along with engineers and cabin crew members assembled at its headquarters to show their solidarity over salary delays.
The airline has just six-seven planes for operations, way below its peak of 123 planes in December. The airline’s overseas operations are carried out by wide-body Boeing B777s and Airbus A330s while it deploys smaller B737s into the Middle East and Southeast Asia markets.
Aviation experts say it will be a big task for the airline to attain normalcy even if banks extend emergency funding.Significantly, even as the airline is facing a huge turbulence, its share price has remained steady over the last several weeks. On Monday, Jet shares closed 0.52 per cent higher at Rs 261.80 on the BSE.",Jet Airways on the brink as lenders yet to decide on funding

The Ashanti Regional Coordinator of the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO),Kwabena Nsenkyire, has called for the immediate replacement of the roofs of all old houses in Kumasi.
“Some houses in the city are more than 50 years so their roofs have become very weak and pose danger to residents, Mr Nsenkyire added.
According to him, the roofs of several old houses in Kumasi were ripped off during a rainstorm in Kumasi on Thursday evening.
He was of the view that the roofs of old houses in the city should be replaced to avert injuries and possible deaths during rainstorms in Kumasi.
“Most of the roofs on houses that are over 50 years are weak so they can be taken away to cause injuries during rainstorms.
“The roofs of most of the houses in the city were ripped off by strong winds on Thursday evening, and it can happen again because we have a lot of old houses in the city.
“I will therefore suggest that all roofs of old houses in the city should be replaced to help avert injuries,” Nsenkyire stated on Friday.
He said television sets, fridges, mobile phones and other electronic gadgets were destroyed in the affected houses.

http://www.observer.ug/news/headlines/60459-supreme-court-quashes-age-limit-appeal,"The seven member panel of Supreme court judges has quashed the consolidated presidential age limit appeal in a 4-3 verdict.
 Four judges including the chief justice, Bart Katureebe, Jotham Tumwesigye, Rubby Opio Aweri and Stella Arach Amoko quashed the appeal in their judgments delivered separately.
 Those who allowed the appeal are justices Paul Mugamba, Eldad Mwangusya and Lillian Tibatemwa-Ekirikubinza.
 The consolidated appeal stemmed from applications by city lawyer, Male Mabirizi, six opposition members of parliament and Uganda Law Society challenging the decision of the Constitutional court to uphold the approval of the Constitution (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 2017, which paved way for scrapping of the presidential age limit.
 The petitioners ran to the Constitutional court citing various flaws in the approval of the bill that scrapped the presidential age limit to allow President Yoweri Museveni who will have clocked 75-years of age to seek re-election in the 2021 polls. The Constitutional court upheld the amendment, forcing the the petitioners to seek redress in the Supreme court.
 The four judges who upheld the amendment maintained that the lower court didn't err in law and facts when it upheld that the removal of presidential age limits was done in conformity with the law. Justice Tumwesigye noted that the certificate of compliance which was attached to Bill had format but lacked content and this could not mean that the entire Bill was enacted unlawfully.
 He explained that the laws that had earlier been passed illegally including the extension of the MPs term of office to seven years was scrapped off by the lower court and this couldn’t render the whole process unlawful.
 He argued that he had looked at the evidence from the parliament hansard showing that the MPs were given Shs 29 million for consultation and the feedback on the floor of parliament was that they indeed did the consultations.
 Quoting the Lira district Woman MP, justice Tumwesigye said that the evidence showed that she was given money to do consultations in her district and about 6,000 voters turned up. However, police reportedly disrupted them with teargas. In his view; Tumwesigye stated that consultations were done.
 Unanimously, the four justices said that the Shs 29 million was not withdrawn from the consolidated fund as raised by the petitioners. They state that the money was reportedly got from the Parliamentary budget.
 The justices also found out that although the raid by the army and assault on the legislators was uncalled for, the legislators who had been allegedly assaulted were supported to seek compensation and file complaints against their attackers in the courts of law.
 The justices thus dismissed the application with orders that each party bears its own costs in since this was a public interest issue.  Justice Katureebe who led the justices also dismissed the application without giving reasons since he was reportedly unwell to read the entire judgment.
 Justice Katureebe delegated justice Mwangusya to read the summary on his behalf.
 DISSENTING JUDGES
 Three justices; Mugamba, Mwangusya and Tibatemwa differed from their colleagues. They argued that the citizens were never consulted adding that the evidence from parliament indicated that most of the MPs were never given ample time to debate the matter.
 They explained that out of the 462 MPs, less than 200 consulted their electorate, which implies that the entire process was rushed by parliament.
 The Justices also noted that it was illegal for the speaker of parliament to include the Bill on the order paper yet the day it was tabled, it was not part of what was earlier been for discussion by parliament.
 The three justices also unanimously ruled that they could not maintain an illegality since they understand clearly that the decision taken by parliament was taking them back to the sad history of Uganda.",Updated: Supreme court quashes age limit appeal

https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jmb-joins-hands-with-let-to-expand-activities-in-india/story-Wf0FqoCAfwZNW0ntDTYB9J.html,"The Narendra Modi government designated Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) as a terrorist group this month after intelligence inputs suggested that its leaders in Dhaka have joined hands with the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Tayebba (LeT) to expand the group’s activities in India. JMB’s chief Salaudin Salehin, through its official media “Al-Ehsar” has already announced the terror group’s India chapter JMH for expansion of its jihadist activities in India.
According to senior home ministry officials, the JMB had plans to make permanent bases within 10 km of the India-Bangladesh border (on the Indian side) in the districts of West Bengal, Assam and Tripura.
The terror group, which espouses the ultra-hardline ideologies of the Islamic State, has also been spreading its network in South India with the overarching motive of establishing a Caliphate in the Indian sub-continent.
Also read: PM Modi, 57-member team of ministers begin second innings
This was revealed during the interrogation of Jahidul Islam, who along with his 12-member action team was arrested in connection with the 2018 Bodhgaya blast.
According to Islam, who hails from Bangladesh, Gaya and other iconic Buddhist centres in India were the intended targets of the JMB as a part of their revenge for the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar and to express solidarity with Rohingya Muslims.
Interrogation reports accessed by the Hindustan Times reveal that JMB cadres have increasingly been using madarasas in Burdwan and Murshidabad districts of West Bengal for training of their militant cadres.
Their training programmes include sessions on fabrication of shaped improvised explosive devices (IEDs), religious indoctrination, and physical exercises including target practice.
According to a home ministry report, the JMB has spread rapidly in Assam with the terrorist group organizing capsule courses under the cover of Tablighi Jamaat, a proselytising group, to train local Muslim youth and radicalize them.
The report confirms three-day courses at Larkuchi under Mukalmuwa police station, at Jogipara in Darrang district, at Barpeta district, and one-day courses at Borigoan mosque and at Panpara in Barpeta district. The JMB was proscribed by Bangladesh on February 23, 2005 while India banned it on May 23.

The report says that in mid-2016 JMB chief Salaudin directed some of his cadres to impart bomb training to Samim of Assam and Maulana Yusuf of Bardhaman at Dhubri in Assam. The JMB group assembled for training in Dhubri but were prevented from doing so by local Muslim house owners. Five cases were registered in Assam against the JMB.
The JMB’s network is especially active in all Muslim majority districts of Assam and in West Bengal as these areas are close to their strongholds in northern and north-western Bangladesh. Activities of JMB have also been noticed in Jharkhand, especially Sahebganj and Pakur district. The group uses cross-border matrimonial alliances as a way to establish bases in India.
The terror network of JMB, which has also been banned by UK, came to light after an accidental bomb blast in Burdwan on October 2, 2014, in which two JMB jihadists were killed and another injured. Even after the crackdown by central security agencies, four JMB cadres of Bangladesh origin were arrested by Kolkata special task force in July 2018.
Interrogation of the accused revealed that they were using India as a base to procure arms and ammunition through local dealers to destabilize the Sheikh Hasina regime in Dhaka.

https://manilastandard.net/news/top-stories/293650/ph-credit-rating-upgraded-stable-outlook-cited.html,"S&P Global Ratings on Tuesday raised the Philippines’ sovereign credit rating a notch to BBB+ from BBB , citing the country’s stable outlook, above-average economic growth, healthy external position, and sustainable public finances. READ: Japan’s rating agency lifts PH credit outlook The upgrade put the Philippines at par with Mexico, Peru, Thailand, and Trinidad and Tobago, and higher by a notch than Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Panama, and Uruguay. In a statement, S&P said the stable outlook reflects its assumption that the Philippine economy would continue to achieve above-average real gross domestic product (GDP) growth over the medium term, supporting the sovereign credit profile. “We may raise the ratings over the next two years if the government makes significant further achievements in its fiscal reform program, or if the country’s external position improves such that its status as a net external creditor becomes more secure over the long term,” it said. “We may also raise the ratings if we find that the institutional settings in the Philippines have improved markedly,” it said. On the other hand, it said it may lower the ratings if the government’s fiscal program leads to much higher-than-expected net general government debt levels, or if real GDP growth declines significantly. S&P said the rating upgrade reflected the Philippines’ strong economic growth trajectory, which is expected to continue to drive constructive development outcomes and underpin broader credit metrics over the medium term. “The rating is also supported by solid government fiscal accounts, low public indebtedness, and the economy’s sound external settings,” it said. S&P said the Philippine economy is among the fastest growing in the world on a 10-year weighted average, per capita basis—a reflection of its supportive policy dynamics and improving investment climate. “The country has a relatively diversified economy with an increasingly strong track record of high and stable growth. We estimate GDP per capita will rise to almost US$3,400 in 2019 (we include nonresident nationals in our population data),” it said. S&P projects GDP per capita growth will average about 4.9 percent per year over 2019-2022, based on balanced contributions from private consumption and investment growth.Also, the country’s unemployment rate has been declining for a few years, signaling the economy’s strengthening labor market even as the working-age population continues to grow, it said. It said the economy’s constructive trajectory should be underpinned by strong household and company balance sheets, continued income growth, sizable inward remittance flows, and an adequately performing financial system. S&P further said the government has so far achieved partial success with its “Comprehensive Tax Reform Program.” The program aims to ensure that finances remain sustainable while addressing the nation’s pressing infrastructure needs and chronic underinvestment. The tax reform program is partially intended to fund the administration’s “Build, Build, Build” scheme, through which the government plans to significantly boost infrastructure spending. In the first package of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion, measure (1-a) was implemented in 2018, supporting the expansion of national government revenue to 16.4 percent of GDP, from 15.6 percent in 2017. Meanwhile, S&P said the delay in the national budget approval would likely entail a lower-than-programmed fiscal deficit for the entire year as government agencies struggle to implement the entire 2019 budget. “Although we view this budget delay as a likely one-off, more such delays in [the] future could be considered as credit negative, especially if related to the institutional settings in the Philippines,” it said. Last year, the economy grew by 6.2 percent, missing the official target range of 6.5 to 7.5 percent, pulled down by a higher inflation rate and the sluggish contribution of the agriculture sector. This year, the economy is seen to grow between 6 percent and 7 percent, on the back of faster fiscal spending, robust domestic demand and investments. The Philippines also enjoys investment grade ratings from Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investor Service. READ: Market climbs; ISM, Cemex gain",PH credit rating upgraded; stable outlook cited

THE Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) is set to roll out a five-month national inquiry on identity documents to establish gaps and the extent of their unavailability among Zimbabweans.
The inquiry is part of fostering and enforcement of human rights enshrined in the Constitution, which states that everyone has a right to an identity.
Speaking on the sidelines of the human rights training for Government officials and community leaders in Kariba recently, ZHRC chief human rights officer Mrs Karukai Ratsauka said the commission was responding to widespread and recurrent challenges of documentation among Zimbabweans.
The inquiry is expected to begin in the first week of July in Masvingo and spread to other provinces until the end of November.
“We are going to be conducting a National Inquiry on Documentation and the first public hearings will be held in Masvingo, starting in the first week of July.
“The issue of identity documents — including birth certificates, national IDs, passports, citizenship for those formerly known as aliens and death certificates —has become a crisis issue,” she said.
Said Mrs Ratsauka: “We are saying that it is an issue given the number of complaints that we are receiving from the generality of the people. People always raise it during our awareness outreaches on human rights.
“As a commission, we have a mandate to inspect old people’s homes, children’s homes and other places of detention and this issue of documentation always comes up.”
She said the inquiry will run from July to end of November.
Turning to the acceptance of human rights in the country, she said Zimbabweans had embraced the concept.
“We are very happy about the positive development in terms of acceptance of human rights. We have long shifted from a situation where people did not want to discuss human rights issues,” she said.
“There is a positive shift among Government officials and departments as shown by their attendance to the programmes where the issues are being discussed. We have realised that Government officials as duty bearers have long embraced human rights and the human rights based approach we are promoting.”
She said while there have been isolated incidents of concern regarding economic and social rights as a result of the economic situation in the country, there has been overall improvement in terms of human rights.",National documentation inquiry on cards

Indian budget airline SpiceJet Ltd is examining the prospect of taking over widebody jets previously operated by Jet Airways Ltd, but initial studies show they need significant maintenance work, its chairman said on Saturday.
SpiceJet, which operates narrowbody and turboprop planes, does not have firm plans to become a widebody operator with longer-range flights in the wake of Jet’s collapse in April, SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh said.
“Certainly a gap has been created and there seems to be an opportunity but it is also a business that we don’t know very much about. A higher risk business,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of an airline industry conference in Seoul.
“We are exploring it. We’ll see. If it looks like it is significantly profitable we can do it.”
Leasing or buying widebody jets not previously operated by Jet are another possibility, he said.
SpiceJet took over the leases of 25 Boeing Co 737 jets previously operated by Jet in April and May.
The carrier plans to add another 35 planes throughout the financial year ending March 31, 2020, including some more ex-Jet aircraft on lease, some Q400 turboprops and “hopefully” 737 MAX jets after regulators approve the return to service of the grounded model, Singh said.

SpiceJet had a 13.1% share of India’s domestic market in April, according to government statistics, behind IndiGo’s 49.9% and Air India’s 13.9%.
Singh said IndiGo’s increasing dominance of the domestic market was becoming a cause for concern to the broader industry.
“I think the government will have to explore what possibilities exist” for remedies, he said. “We haven’t thought about it as yet.

Madrid (AFP)
Luka Jovic has pledged to fight for his place at Real Madrid after the Serbia striker was unveiled to his new fans at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday.
Jovic kissed the badge and applauded around 4,500 supporters that turned out to welcome him after Madrid had confirmed the signing of the player from Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday for around 65 million euros ($73.5 million).
""I am the happiest kid in the world,"" Jovic said in a press conference. ""I am very happy to belong to the biggest club in the world and I hope to fulfil everything that is expected of me.""
Jovic's arrival on a six-year contract means Madrid have added three players this summer, with Eder Militao and Eden Hazard also joining from Benfica and Chelsea respectively.
Hazard will be presented at the Bernabeu on Thursday night, when the club hopes the attendance could even exceed the 70,000 that greeted Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009.
The Belgian is likely to be a guaranteed starter next season but Jovic's place looks less secure given that Karim Benzema and Vinicius Junior were arguably Madrid's two best players last season.
As it stands, Gareth Bale, Marco Asensio, Brahim Diaz, Isco, Mariano Diaz and Lucas Vazquez also remain at the club, completing a lengthy list of attacking options.
""The competition is fierce but if I work hard, I will get my chance. Then if I don't take it, it's my fault,"" said Jovic. ""I have not talked to Zidane yet but I've played as a second striker at Eintracht and I can also play on my own.""
He added: ""I think I can be do well with Benzema but it is up to the coach to decide.""
Jovic joined Eintracht on loan from Benfica in 2017 and after making the move permanent, enjoyed a superb second season with the German club, scoring 17 goals in 32 league appearances.
He will be expected to provide more incision up front for Madrid, who lacked goals last season, struggling to fill the void left by Ronaldo's departure to Juventus.
Club president Florentino Perez claimed Jovic chose Madrid ahead of other interested clubs. ""We know very well that others wanted to have you but you have fought to be here,"" Perez said.
""We have to start winning again and today is a day to welcome a player who has to help us complete this mission.""

Their win against South Africa had the stamp of authority, as is expected from a strong contender. Jasprit Bumrah has shaped his career as one of the best fast bowlers in the world and unarguably, India's best. He rattled the South African batsmen with pace and bounce, and maintained a good line and length. Bhuvaneshwar Kumar gave him the able support in pace department, and Yuzvendra Chahal took full advantage of South Africa's inability to play spin the leggie ran through the line-up with ease.
Rohit Sharma scored an unbeaten century to guide India home, and his form will be crucial for India in this World Cup. Shikhar Dhawan has an excellent record in the ICC tournaments, and India will expect him to perform after failure against South Africa. Virat Kohli will look to maintain his excellent against Australia, a match which will test India's batting line up and show where it stands at the early stage of the tournament.
Australia have won both their matches so far. While their match against Afghanistan was a one sided affair, their comeback against West Indies after being 38-4 showed the 'never say die' attitude that has given them five World Cups. Steve Smith's form will further bolster their already powerful batting line-up, and Nathan Coulter-Nile's heroics with the bat down the order will give them the confidence of going berserk early in their innings. Mitchell Starc with his five wickets haul once again showed why he is always a threat for the opposition.
In their most recent meeting, Australia won 3-2 in the ODI series against India, that too in the latter's home ground.
India vs Australia is expected to be a cracker of a game, and going by the recent records, the match will go down to the wire. The team that can hold their nerves and seize the crucial moments will come out victorious.
Weather report: There is forecast of rain in the middle period of the match, with the conditions expected to remain overcast. The temperature will hover around 18-10 degrees Celsius.
Pitch report: The Kennington Oval have witnessed three 300 plus score in the last six matches played there. The pitch will heavily assist the batsmen, so do expect a run fest in this match as well.

Accordingly, the authorities have exclusively appointed two engineers to oversee the operations of the conduct of last rites at a cost of ₹ 1 only. There is a permanent watchman at the crematorium and four-member band troupe.Presently, the local corporators, philanthropists and the sanitary workers would be informing the MCK authorities about the death of a person in any locality in the town. Later, the MCK is planning to start a toll-free number for the people to inform the authorities about conducting last rites. This service takes care of complete funeral arrangements as per the specifications of the family. For the Hindus, they would conduct funeral by arranging the
paadi (bier), a hearse to take the dead body to crematorium, supply of necessary puja material, firewood, kerosene, ghee etc. If they want a burial , they would dig the pit with the staff of the MCK. Similarly for the Muslims and Christians communities, last rites can be held as per their own specifications.
“We are fully equipped to perform the last rites of any person at a cost of ₹ 1 only and give a respectful adieu to the dead person,” said Mayor S. Ravinder Singh. In the first phase, the MCK had allocated ₹ 49 lakh for the implementation of Antima Yatra, he said and added that they would be spending ₹ 7,000 to perform last rites of a Hindu person and it would be even lesser for other communities. Stating that he had donated ₹ 50,000 from his salary for the scheme, he said that the donations were pouring in for this novel scheme and already the municipal employees have announced their one-day salary. Other philanthropists were donating liberally which had crossed over ₹ 5 lakh so far. He said that they had also informed the inmates of the old-age homes and other orphanages for the conduct of last rites by the MCK at a cost of ₹ 1 only.

It aims to close off the U.S. asylum system to the migrants who have crossed through Guatemala en route to the United States. They would instead have to seek protection in Guatemala.

But the agreement is built on a fragile political and legal base. The Guatemalan Constitutional Court ruled earlier this month that President Jimmy Morales needed approval from the Guatemalan Congress to sign the accord, something he has not received. Morales has sharply criticized the court decision, saying Friday that “as far as we understand, this doesn’t have to go before Congress.”
Some analysts said Morales could get around the ruling with his argument that the deal is simply a cooperation agreement, not a treaty. Others note Morales has at times simply shrugged off court rulings he dislikes.
“This leaves a legacy we won’t be able to recover from, that the country’s constitution can be flagrantly violated without any kind of reaction or penalty,” said Renzo Rosal, an independent political consultant.
AD
AD
The agreement is also likely to be challenged in U.S. courts by opponents who say Guatemala does not qualify as a “safe” country, because of high levels of violence.
Whatever happens with the courts, the agreement has little political support in Guatemala. Morales, who finishes his four-year term in January, is highly unpopular. Among the top Twitter hashtags in Guatemala in recent days has been #Jimmy­vendepatrias — Jimmy the sellout — as a dig at the country’s leader.
Guatemalans were startled by a widely published photo showing their government minister, Enrique Degenhart, signing the agreement as Trump loomed over his shoulder, an image suggesting the Central American country’s submission.
AD
On Saturday, hundreds of people demonstrated in front of the presidential palace in Guatemala City to protest the agreement, the Associated Press reported. Protesters carried Guatemalan flags and called for Morales’s resignation.
AD
Guatemalan analysts have suggested Morales made the deal with Trump in hopes of winning support from the U.S. government. Morales faces allegations of financial crimes related to his 2015 electoral campaign but has been shielded by presidential immunity, which he loses in January. He says he is innocent.
Morales said the agreement would help Guatemala by “putting us in a privileged position” with the country’s top trading partner and most important ally.
AD
Guatemala holds a runoff presidential election on Aug. 11, and both candidates have criticized Morales’s negotiation of such a broad agreement in secret.
The accord “is unlikely to be sustainable,” Stephen McFarland, a former U.S. ambassador to Guatemala, wrote in a tweet on the eve of the agreement’s unveiling. “A bitter U.S. ‘win’ would put at risk U.S. goals in democracy and law enforcement with the current and next governments.”
AD
While the next Guatemalan government could cancel the deal, it would face intense pressure from the Trump administration to not do so. Morales’s government signed the pact after Trump threatened severe penalties on Guatemala — tariffs, a travel ban or taxes on the billions of dollars in remittances sent home by migrants in the United States. Kevin McAleenan, the acting Homeland Security secretary, said the administration plans to start the “safe third country” program with Guatemala in August.
AD
Human rights groups, Democratic lawmakers and immigration experts have said Guatemala is too poor and underdeveloped to handle a flood of asylum applicants. Last year, Salvadoran and Honduran migrants filed nearly 58,000 applications for asylum in the United States. That year, Guatemala received just 259 asylum applications overall.
Guatemala is the top source of irregular migration to the United States, with citizens fleeing poverty, violence, drought and low coffee prices. Eric Schwartz, head of Refugees International and a former top refugee official at the U.S. State Department, said in a statement that the pact “would represent a grotesque violation of both U.S. law and human decency” and “would put at risk the lives of thousands of Central Americans.”
AD
Sonia Lucia Valenzuela, a constitutional law expert in Guatemala, said the Constitutional Court ruling was clear in instructing Morales to send the agreement to Congress but that political pressures could determine what happens next. The migration agreement has been strongly supported by Guatemala’s influential business groups, who had feared U.S. tariffs. But many current and former politicians oppose it.",Guatemala’s migrant pact with the U.S. threatens to unleash a political crisis

Deputy Speaker, CIBAC Party-List Rep. Eddie Villanueva is batting for the creation of a special hospital that would cater to the needs of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and their dependents.
Dubbed the Bagong Bayaning Filipino Hospital, its proposed creation is embodied in a bill filed Wednesday by Villanueva and his fellow CIBAC nominee, Rep. Domeng Rivera at the House of Representatives.
“It is sad that many of our fellow Filipinos choose to work abroad and leave their families behind out of economic necessity. While overseas Filipino workers’ (OFWs) remittances have been recognized as an important pillar in the country’s economic development, very little resources seem to be allocated to ensure their welfare,” Villanueva noted.
“Our OFWs deserve more benefits, especially, access to quality health care,” underscored the Deputy Speaker.
He cited studies by the Overseas Worker Welfare Association (OWWA) in Davao, which showed that OFWs were prone to suffer from hypertension, heart attack, breast, and ovarian cancers.
These ailments were either diagnosed during their work abroad or upon their return back to the Philippines.
“We want to redouble our efforts in taking care of our OFWs who brave the miles just to provide a brighter future for their families,” Villanueva said.
Once enacted into law, the measure will complement the Department of Labor and Employment’s (DOLE) initiative in establishing a hospital for OFWs not just in the National Capital Region but also in provinces across the country.
It also mandates the establishment of regional hospitals that will prioritize the needs of the OFWs and their dependents.
For his part, Rivera said OFWs are more at risk health-wise “since our OFWs battle different working conditions in foreign lands.”
“This bill aims to give prime importance to their health, being our modern-day heroes, as well as their dependents, through the building of the Bagong Bayaning Filipino Hospital,” he said.
Along with the Bagong Bayaning Filipino Hospital bill, the CIBAC lawmakers also filed other measures such as the proposed Freelance Workers Protection Act, OFW Insurance Act, Beverage Container Disposal Act, and additional benefits for all teaching personnel in State Universities and Colleges and State-Run Technical and vocational institutions.","Special hospital for OFWs, dependents pushed"

The Haryana government appealed to the Supreme Court against the NGT order, which effectively meant that construction cannot take place in the village. The government had, prior to the NGT order, already issued permission to builders to carry our construction on the plot.

“The bench refused to the stay the NGT order. So the NGT order is in place and the plot should be considered a forest for now. Col Singh has been asked to file a reply to Haryana’s appeal in SC,” said Ritwick Dutta, who represents Singh in SC. The order is yet to be published.
Haryana’s additional advocate general, Anil Grover, who is representing the state, said: “The bench said the matter requires detailed consideration.” The licences issued to the builders would not be revoked, he added.
Three months after the NGT held the 52-acre plot in the Faridabad Aravallis, where more than 7,000 trees were felled in 2017 for a housing project, was a “deemed forest,” the Haryana government moved the SC, saying the NGT order was “erroneous in law.”
The plea raised questions of law, whether any land can be declared a deemed forest despite a different stand taken by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, which is in the process of finalising the definition of a forest; and whether the enquiry report the NGT considered to deliver its ruling was “illegal, vitiated and liable” to be rejected, among others.
One of the main contentions of the plea filed in NGT in June 2017 was that the Haryana government had been in violation of the Supreme Court orders in the TN Godavarman and Lafarge cases pertaining to forest issues in 1996 and 2011, respectively.
Those judgments said irrespective of whether an area is a forest as per revenue records, it will be covered by the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and cannot be used for any non-forestry activity without the Centre’s permission.
The petitioner argued that the same standard should be applied to the Sarai Khwaja plot, which had dense vegetation-- 8,254 trees and rootstock with over 38,000 stems, according to the Haryana forest department’s own count.",Supreme Court declines to stay NGT order calling Faridabad plot a forest

https://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/news/kwazulu-natal/watch-cable-theft-alarms-wentworth-residents-30021661,"A man who allegedly stole a cable said it was a ‘dead cable’.
Durban - RESIDENTS of Wentworth have expressed concern at a spike in cable theft in the area, including cable being stolen in broad daylight close to the local police station. A video sent to the Daily News shows a man alleged to be a drug addict next to a cut cable, which is presumably to be sold.
The man who took the video said he had been watching a group of men digging a hole outside a block of flats on Major Calvert Street.
“I had been watching them for four days and when I approached them they told me that they were just digging a hole,” he said.
However, the area later experienced a power outage, and the video shows the man walking past cable that he had allegedly cut.
Witnesses said they saw the man with a group of other men cutting cables almost daily.

Another resident, Keith van Niekerk, said drug addicts stole the cables in broad daylight. Asked what they were doing, they say they were taking “dead cables”, he said.
“Driving past today I saw another guy digging. This is the third day I have seen them digging,” he said.
eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said cable theft was a huge challenge. He said a man was recently sentenced to 15 years in jail for cable theft.
“The city will embark on a communications campaign to mobilise communities to partner with government in nipping this scourge in the bud.
“The SAPS have also been put on high alert to nab criminals in this regard,’’ he said.
The jailed thief was caught in September 2017 with 500m of copper cable in Pinetown.
The value of the cable was estimated at more than R27000.
Cable theft can be reported by calling the Cable Theft Hotline at 031 311 9611, or the electricity department’s call centre at 080 13 13 111.

As many as 46,444 vehicles are engaged in transporting school children across the state, as per the government. Initially, over 6,000 of them were found unfit and operators were asked to obtain NoC after rectifying the shortcomings.
“Now, 2,108 of the over 6,000 vehicles have been found fit while the registration of 847 has been cancelled. Operators of the remaining 3,424 have been asked to obtain fitness certificates to avoid cancellation of registration,” said a government spokesperson.
If these the operators don’t get the fitness certificate in the next six months, their vehicles would lose registration, added the spokesperson.
There are three categories of school vehicles as per the rules notified by the state government recently. These include buses owned and operated by schools, buses owned by private operators and ferrying children as an agreement between parents and bus operators and vehicles including vans, autos, and tempos.
In May this year, the government amended motor vehicles rules to pave way for the safety of school vehicles. The new rules mandate: Female attendant in a school vehicle if a girl child is travelling in it; CCTVs; ban on open body vehicles to ferry school children and speed limits. These rules will be implemented strictly from September 1.
In December 1997, the apex court gave a ruling in a case MC Mehta vs Union of India and others and issued guidelines for safety of school buses. Schools had been asked to designate transport managers to ensure safe arrival and departure of children.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. aluminum maker Novelis [NVLXC.UL] must offer concessions to European Union competition authorities by Aug. 9 to gain approval for its $2.6 billion takeover of aluminum processor Aleris [TXPACA.UL], sources close to the matter said.
Novelis, part of India’s Hindalco Industries, bid for Aleris in July last year as part of its diversification into the aerospace, automotive, beverage can and construction industries among others.
The European Commission conducted a four-month investigation of the acquisition and last month set out its concerns over how the deal could hurt competition, particularly for carmakers that use the companies’ products.
The EU competition enforcer, which is scheduled to decide on the case by Sept. 16, and Novelis declined to comment.
Novelis and Aleris defended the proposed deal before antitrust officials at a closed-door hearing last week, hoping to address EU competition concerns and secure unconditional approval.
Trade unions from Belgium and Germany also attended the hearing to voice support for the deal, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Ahead of the hearing, Novelis felt it was premature to talk about concessions but it has never ruled out the possibility, people close to the situation told Reuters last month.
The company is ready to make a written commitment to increase capacity and add 80 new jobs at the Aleris plant in Duffel, Belgium, to allay regulatory concerns that capacity may be curtailed to increase prices, a source close to the matter said.
Novelis has argued that the deal will not lead to higher prices because of competition from other aluminum and steel producers as well as customers’ willingness to switch to rivals.",Exclusive: Novelis must offer concessions or face EU veto to $2.6 billion Aleris deal - sources

https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-abdication-of-the-opposition/story-3tNZwia3ejovoK4393zGXN.html,"When a political party has just won an electoral majority, it can be expected that it would use its numerical advantage to push through its legislative agenda. When the victory has been accompanied with the rout of other parties at the polls, the incumbent has an additional political and psychological edge. And, so, it is understandable that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been able to convert its 2019 Lok Sabha victory into policy victories in the current session of Parliament, including on its constitutional moves on Jammu and Kashmir.
But this still does not explain, or justify, the utter abdication of responsibility by the Opposition parties. This abdication has taken two forms: the lack of clarity in its ranks on key policy matters being discussed in Parliament; and the inability to put up a democratic fight even in a chamber where they, collectively, outnumber the BJP. Take the first. On the government’s move to render Article 370 ineffective, bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), and reduce the state to a Union Territory, the Congress response has been marked by complete incoherence and confusion. Rahul Gandhi took over 24 hours to put out his first critical tweet. Even as the leader of the party in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, slammed the government, the chief whip of the Congress in the same House, Bhubaneswar Kalita, resigned, protesting, in principle, against the party’s stance. Adhir Ranjan Choudhary, the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, suggested that Kashmir was actually an international — and not just an internal — issue, prompting Home Minister Amit Shah to ask if this was the party’s official stance. On the other hand, some other senior leaders like Janardhan Dwivedi backed the government. Do not be surprised if the Congress workers on the ground, let alone citizens, have no clue what the party actually believes in.
The incoherence is supplemented by the lack of unity and floor strategy. During the vote on the triple talaq bill, for instance, all Congress members did not turn up to vote. On Kashmir, the opposition fractured entirely, with parties as critical of the BJP as Bahujan Samaj Party and Aam Aadmi Party backing the government. A range of other regional parties — the Telangana Rashtra Samithi, YSR Congress Party, and Biju Janata Dal — have been supportive of the government, helping it gain numbers in the Rajya Sabha. And every other day, a member or two resigns from the Opposition benches, paving the way for fresh elections from states, which, in turn, helps swell BJP numbers. Put it all together, and it clear that not only was the Opposition trounced in the election, but it has also lost the will to fight. This bodes ill for democracy.",The abdication of the Opposition

Paolo Duterte, will join the National Unity Party, fueling talks that he may gun for the speakership once the 15 months tenure of Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano expires. Marinduque Rep. Lord Alan Velasco is supposed to succeed Cayetano in the last 21 months of the 18th Congress under the term sharing agreement brokered by President Rodrigo Duterte. A source said the President’s son would take his oath next week as a member of the NUP, that used to be called Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino, that propelled President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to the presidency. Arroyo and Senate President Vicente Sotto III founded the party in the 1990s. Meanwhile, the leadership of the House of Representatives said it would equally distribute positions as well as committee chairmanships and memberships among its members from various political parties, a House official said. At the same time, Deputy Speaker Raneo Abu of Batangas said he was optimistic the House would be able to organize the composition of 60 standing committees and 15 special committees in the next few days. “We’re still in the thick [committee assignments] of it,” Abu said. “The House leadership wants the positions equally distributed among House members from different parties so there are meetings after meetings.” Abu said the House leadership wanted to equally distribute positions and committees among its members who come from different parties led by the ruling party PDP-Laban. “We all want to help the President and make him succeed—that’s our common denominator,” he said.It was not immediately known if the young Duterte would renounce his membership in the local political party Hugpong ng Tawong Lungsod when he would take his oath as an NUP member on Aug. 6 during the party’s national congress, expected to elect a new set of national officers. “There is a good possibility that Rep. Duterte will become the president. I don’t think there is any violation of the party Charter,” an NUP source said. At present, the NUP is headed by Capiz Rep. Fredenil Castro.

Oyo State government has pledged its readiness to assist the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC, in the state in providing befitting auditorium that would make activities conducive during the orientation course.
Governor Seyi Makinde gave the assurance on Monday in a message through the deputy governor, Mr Rauf Olaniyan at the passing out parade of 2019 Batch ‘B’ (stream 2) corps members posted to the state, held at the NYSC Permanent Orientation Camp, Ogbakuta, Iseyin.
Makinde who said the government was poised at ensuring a conducive environment for corps members posted to the state, urging the youths to translate all they learnt during orientation course to a positive attitude to develop the country.
In his words: “On our own part, this administration and the good people of Oyo the “Pacesetter” State assures you of excellent hospitality. The state is very peaceful and accommodating. As you move into the thirty-three (33) local government areas of the state, you will find the environment conducive to live and work in and your welfare and security is highly guaranteed. This government will continue to assist the scheme to achieve its objectives.”
“To our esteemed corps employers, I implore you to assign to these corps members challenging tasks and duties that will make them productive. The corps members should not be left redundant.”
Also read:
“As you carry out the Community Development Service wherever you are posted, it will go a long way to complement the efforts of government and contribute immensely to the development of the “Pacesetter” State,” he said.
Earlier, the state coordinator of NYSC, Mrs Eniola Ambekemo had said infrastructure within the camp was not sufficient for the corps members.
She maintained that the scheme needed more toilets and an ultramodern auditorium, urging people of the state to warmly receive the corps members. One thousand seven hundred corps members participated in the passing out parade.
Ambekemo said: “Your Excellency, I wish to inform you that the duration of the three weeks on camp with over One thousand seven hundred (1700) Corps members, was peaceful with participants exhibiting excellent behaviour, high sense of discipline and active participation in all Camp activities. The Course officials and our Collaborating partners also worked tirelessly to ensure that we had a seamless Orientation course.”
“Your Excellency Sir, our Orientation camp is in dire need of an auditorium that can accommodate all our Corps members. We are therefore appealing to the state government to kindly come to our aid by providing us with an ultra-modern auditorium that can accommodate 4000 Corps members. We also need additional hostel blocks and toilet facilities that can conveniently cater to the rising number of corps members deployed to the state,” she pleaded.

How does technology and beer come together? Well, Flying Fish got South Africans talking by bringing the first ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) experience to the country.
It was all about feeling the flavour with a sensory experience through the ears.

Singer Rowlene Bosman was tasked with getting the attendees at the launch event to really hear what Flying Fish tastes like.
From the twist of a bottle cap to the clink of ice in a frosty glass and the long, slow, audible gulp of a refreshing drink. These were some of the examples given of the sounds which typically provoke a tingling sensation down the back of the neck and which have turned ASMR into a global phenomenon of sensory experiences to soothe the modern soul.

As it is, international audiences have embraced this love affair with sound, as evidenced by the countless ASMR YouTube videos, which are used to relieve stress and promote a certain joie de vivre.
Flying Fish decided to tap into this global trend. The brand’s latest pioneering campaign invites South Africans to engage with the brand as they explore the feeling of what Flying Fish tastes like.

In an Oct. 17 ruling, Brig. Gen. Edward Carranza, outgoing regional police director of Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon), removed from the police service former Tayabas police chief, Lt. Col. Mark Joseph Laygo, Cpl. Lonald Sumalpong and Pat. Robert Legaspi after results of administrative charges filed against them were released.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Under the qualifying circumstances of evident premeditation, treachery and abuse of superior strength attended by aggravating circumstances of grave irregularity in the performance of duty, grave dishonesty and conduct unbecoming of a police officer with no mitigating circumstance to consider … they are hereby meted the commensurate penalty in its maximum period of dismissal from the police service,” Carranza said.
Exonerated
Carranza said they were found guilty of two counts of grave misconduct.
The other respondents in the administrative case, he said, “are found not culpable and they are hereby exonerated from the instant administrative charges.”
They are Master Sgt. Ismael Cabriga; Staff Sgts. Christopher John Siman, Kim Carlo Lavado and Michael Rojas; Cpls. Sherwin Abordo and Roldan Panganiban; Patrolmen Kimberly Manalo, William Allan Ricamonte and Perry Malabaguio.
Laygo, Sumalpong and Legaspi were among the principal suspects in the killing of Christian Gayeta and his companion, Christopher Manalo, in what was reported as a shootout with policemen in Tayabas on March 14.
But a report by the National Bureau of Investigation, in a probe which was sought by the Gayeta family, showed that the younger Gayeta and Manalo were murdered by policemen.
Dominador Villanueva, agent in charge of the NBI Lucena district office, said the victims were stopped at a checkpoint and were taken into custody after they were found carrying two pistols. They were cited for violating the election gun ban.
The NBI had obtained the testimonies of four other policemen who were allegedly involved in the supposed shootout, which prompted the filing of double murder charges against Laygo, Sumalpong and Legaspi. The three policemen are detained at the Quezon provincial jail. —Delfin T. Mallari Jr.

It is his class X marksheet from 2004. The result declares ‘re-appear’ in English (27/100 marks) and Mathematics (12/100).
“I never knew that I will need this marksheet again. Today I am realizing its value when I filled the form for Golden Chance exam,” says Zorawar, now an electrician making Rs 20,000 per month.
“I wasn’t such a dull student. God knows what happened in English and maths,” he laughs, showing the marksheet – 69 in Punjabi, 33 in Hindi, 40 in science and 51 in social science.
He never went for the “re-appear exams” and started working as a helper in factory for Rs 2,200 a month. “The circumstances at home were such. My father lost his vision and wasn’t earning. My brother also did not clear his class X and both parents being illiterate, no one really forced or encouraged me to study again,” says Zorawar, with wife Sanmeet (20), standing next to him.

She had cleared class X. “He too should study now. He should have class X certificate at least,” she says.
Depositing Rs 15,000 as exam fee, an amount which is three-fourth of his monthly income, “wasn’t easy” for Zorawar, who says he decided to take it out from his savings, because it was “necessary”.

“I did not get to know about Golden Chance offered in 2011 and missed it. This time, I did not want to,” he says. “I am an experienced electrician and can repair everything, from AC and fridge to television. But I am nothing on papers. I am not even dassvin pass. This is embarrassing. I am not even qualified to become a panchayat member,” says Zorawar.
“Maybe friends and others won’t say it directly but then it does come up whenever there is some discussion that I am not even 10th pass. It feels bad,” he says.
Zorawar is yet to buy books and start preparing for exam that will be held as per new syllabus. “Now there is nothing like writing an essay on ‘My Best Friend’ or ‘My Mother’. The grammar too is not easy. I did have a look at English syllabus but I haven’t yet seen the mathematics syllabus. It is going to be tough,” he laughs.

If he clears class X this time, Zorawar will be second in his family to do so, after his younger sister. “Now when I have applied, I need to finish it this time. I will,” he says.
Sitting next to him, Gagandeep Singh, his postgraduate friend with whom he consulted first before applying, says that he never wanted to discourage Zorawar knowing latest syllabus will be tough but not impossible. “Main keha bhar de, dekhi jaugi hun (I just told him to fill the form.

If the objections are cleared within 10 days or so and with the consent of the petitioners, elections can be held in all these 78 municipalities, the judge said. Otherwise, each petition has to be heard separately.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Thursday it had arranged for some orphans to be brought home from Syria, joining Germany, Belgium and Australia in repatriating children whose parents were suspected members of Islamic State.
Britain has generally been reluctant to allow adults who traveled to Syria to return home but Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it was right to bring children home.
“These innocent, orphaned, children should never have been subjected to the horrors of war,” Raab said.
“We have facilitated their return home, because it was the right thing to do. Now they must be allowed the privacy and given the support to return to a normal life.”
Raab did not say how many children were returning. The charity Save The Children said in October that more than 60 British children were trapped in north-eastern Syria.
Many Western countries have struggled with how to deal with citizens who went to the Middle East to join groups such as Islamic State, which was driven out of its last territorial enclave in March by U.S.-backed forces.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/cabinet-expansion-pune-dist-gets-three-berths-western-maha-gets-10/story-nrAjoO5D3wcTp43UoeKI8O.html,"Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday expanded his cabinet which saw the return of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister and induction of Shiv Sena’s Aaditya Thackeray.
While Pune district did get good representation in the cabinet with three legislators, including Ajit Pawar, were sworn-in as ministers, Pune city failed to make it to the Uddhav Thackeray’s expanded ministry.
In Monday’s swearing-in ceremony, Pune district’s Dilip Walse-Patil and Dattatray Bharne were included in the cabinet. While Walse-Patil represents Ambegaon , Bharne is an MLA from Indapur and Ajit Pawar is a seven-time legislator from Baramati.
With three cabinet berths from Pune, NCP workers say it will help them firm up their grip on the district where the party has won 10 out of 21 seats.
In Pune city, six out of eight seats are being represented by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while only two are with NCP legislators Sunil Tingre (Wadgaonsheri) and Chetan Tupe (Hadapsar)
On the other hand, western Maharashtra got a total of 10 berths in the Thackeray cabinet. The important position held by Pawar brings back western Maharashtra into power. The control of government shifted to Nagpur during the former CM Devendra Fadnavis government.
Of the ten berths, five are of cabinet ranks while the rest are of minister of state. Besides, Pawar, three other NCP leaders - Dilip Walse-Patil, Hasan Mushrif, Balasaheb Patil - and an independent Shankarrao Gadak were sworn-in as cabinet ministers while Satej Patil, Vishwajeet Kadam (both from Congress), Shambhuraje Desai (Shiv Sena) Dattatray Bharane (NCP), and Rajendra Patil Yadravkar (independent) took oath as junior ministers.
The only big name that was left out in the cabinet from Congress was that of Prithviraj Chavan, who is likely to get an important position in the party’s state unit.
“I was never a contender for a cabinet post. I am happy in the party and will continue to provide my services in whichever way I can,” said Chavan on being asked about whether he will be made state unit chief by Congress party.
This is the third time that Ajit Pawar has become a deputy chief minister; his first term in this position was under Prithviraj Chavan as chief minister during 2010 to 2014. He was also deputy CM for three days when Devendra Fadnavis took oath as chief minister in November, but resigned as the BJP could not gather requisite numbers.
The NCP and Congress together have won 39 of the 70 seats from western Maharashtra in state assembly polls held in October this year. The impressive performance of NCP by winning 27 seats in this region has helped the party regain its lost control over the stronghold.

The woman told the police that the man kept the dog in front of him so she could not do anything to him. She, however, managed to take his picture and later submitted it to the police.

https://www.chronicle.co.zw/medical-aid-goes-beyond-reach-of-many/,"Paidamoyo Chipunza, Harare Bureau
As private hospitals, doctors and laboratories continue pushing up their fees faster than inflation, medical aid societies are following suit.
This is forcing many out of private health care and private health insurance as they can no longer afford the fees and subscriptions.
The Association of Healthcare Funders of Zimbabwe (AHFoZ) issued new pricing guidelines in November last year to cushion members against huge co-payments and shortfalls. The adjusted rates are now forcing some members to either downgrade packages or drop health insurance completely.
This has been exacerbated by the fact that few salaries and incomes have been rising at anything like the cost of health care in Zimbabwe and now it is quite easy for a family’s medical aid subscriptions to be greater than their gross pay.
Taking civil service salaries as a guide, the least-paid civil servant is taking home $1 023 per month. But medical aid societies are now charging about $600 for an average plan covering only the member plus a similar amount for the first adult dependent, an average of $350 every month for each dependent child.
This means a monthly subscription for an average plan covering member, spouse and two children is attracting about $1 900 every month, an amount that is far beyond the reach of an average Zimbabwean in formal employment, forcing many to either downgrade to basic packages, which pay bills at public clinics and hopitals, or drop health insurance completely.
The increases were necessitated by the cost of healthcare which continues to increase with general practitioners now demanding at least $300 in consultation fees and specialists between $1 100 and $1 800 for each consultation.
Private hospitals have since resorted to demanding deposits of up to $10 000 for a patient seeking admission for hospitalisation and subsequent procedures.
Government institutions have also increased consultation fees in all its facilities with patients seeking treatment from central hospitals now expected to pay at least $160 for adults, although this is very low compared to private health care.
Laboratory procedures, medicines and all other associated medical services have gone up with most providers using the US dollar black-market rates to peg costs of their services.
An average health insurance package provides members and their beneficiaries’ access to private health care (general practitioners and specialists), investigations and some procedures. The ceiling of one’s financial benefit on an average plan is also limited and does not usually cover major procedures that might be required out of the country.
A basic medical aid package provides members and their beneficiaries access to public health facilities and services.
Some medical aid societies have also intensified engagements with “receptive” service providers to do away with co-payments and shortfalls.
Contacted for comment yesterday, AHFoZ chief executive officer Ms Shylet Sanyanga said it was too early to analyse impact of the “inflation adjusted tariffs” on shortfalls, co-payments or even downgrading.
She said AHFoZ would be able to provide a clear picture on what is happening on the ground by end of the first quarter. “Statistics on the impact of the November fee review are not yet available.
“The festive period is usually slow in that fewer people seek healthcare services unless it is an emergency. The same applies on decisions pertaining to downgrading and related decisions. A more realistic picture of the impact on the ground will be established by end of the first quarter 2020,” said Ms Sanyanga.
Health economist Dr Prosper Chatambara said while medical aid has a critical role to play, incomes cannot match with the rate of inflation, rendering the concept useless.
He said even if members resort to saving own money, it remains useless because of inflation.
“If people save on their own, they need to save in a strong currency otherwise the savings are eroded by inflation.
“We all need medical aid because it protects members financially if they suddenly have to pay unexpected medical costs but its more relevant in a normal economy, where there is stability,” said Dr Chatambara.
Another health economist Dr Shepherd Shamu said the current situation calls for employers to totally subsidise their employees’ medical aid cover.
Dr Shamu said without that, most people will deem health insurance an expense and opt out. “For now, employers who care for their employees’ well-being should consider meeting full costs of medical cover until a time when the economy normalises,” said Dr Shamu.
He said for a long term solution, Government should consider an all stakeholders meeting aimed at finding lasting solutions to these and other challenges bedevilling the health sector.
“People really need to meet and come up with an agreed way forward because at the moment everyone is pulling in their own way to satisfy they interests,” said Dr Shamu.
Dr Shamu said people without health insurance often find it difficult to pay huge unexpected medical bills, which in turn impacts on the quality of healthcare rendered to them in times of emergencies.",Medical aid goes beyond reach of many

The beauty queen shared her excitement in an Instagram post where she was seen holding a fake eyeball, presumably to be used for her replica.
“Stay tuned,” her caption wrote.
Madame Tussauds said Gray’s wax figure will be wearing her iconic “lava” gown designed by Mak Tumang.
The red gown, which took inspiration from the Mayon Volcano, was the gown Catriona wore when she was crowned.
The wax figure will debut in Manila but will first stay at the Singapore branch before moving to Bangkok and Hong Kong.

“The Philippines continues to be one of our strongest markets and having Manny Pacquaio who is known globally for his achievements in sports is an honour for us.

https://clubofmozambique.com/news/mozambique-five-more-villages-attacked-in-cabo-delgado-aim-151772/,"Terrorist groups on Tuesday attacked five communities in Quissanga district, in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, according to a report in Wednesday’s issue of the independent newssheet “Carta de Mocambique”.
The attacks were against the villages of Nraha 2, Mussomero, Namidai, Namiruma and Mahate. The raiders burnt down homes and the Mahate health centre and beheaded seven of their victims. The terrorists intercepted these people as they were on their way to work their fields.
Survivors of the attack on Mahate, cited in Wednesday’s issue of the daily paper “O Pais”, said they believed the insurgents were now threatening to attack Quissanga town, which is about 100 kilometres north of the provincial capital, Pemba.
One source told the paper the insurgents used a megaphone to make this threat, while they were burning down the houses of the local population.
On Monday, the terrorists attacked Mianguelua village, in Muidumbe district, for the second time in two months
President Filipe Nyusi confirmed this attack during his speech in Maputo on Monday, at the opening of the 2020 judicial year.
“Yesterday they attacked a village in Quissanga”, he said. “They also attacked Miangelua before dawn. And our young soldiers are there”.
“The murders are a reality”, said Nyusi. “People are dying, but cases have come to trial”. He was apparently replying to remarks made earlier in the ceremony by the chairperson of the Mozambique Bar Association (OAM), Flavio Menete, who called on the authorities to take action to halt the slaughter and destruction.
“They also warned us that they want to enter the city of Pemba in the coming days”, said another man who had escaped from the insurgents in Mahate.
Veterans lash out at sending “kids” to fight in Cabo Delgado
Meanwhile, veterans of Mozambique’s ten year war for independence, now living in Nampula, have called on Nyusi to give them guns and send them to the front in Cabo Delgado.
Speaking to reporters in Nampula, on Sunday, Mozambican Heroes’ Day, members of the Association of Veterans of the Liberation Struggle (ACLLN), accused Nyusi and the government of sending “kids” to Cabo Delgado rather than accepting their offer to fight.
ACLLN member Jacinto Kavandane said “We veterans are prepared to fight in this war. It’s just a case of Nyusi calling on the veterans to come and fight”.
“I want to go and fight against those who are murdering people in the villages”, he added. “They can’t deny us guns”.
He denied that the former guerrilla fighters are too old and sick to play a useful combat role. The younger men among the veterans, he insisted, wanted to fight.
“We want to fight”, declared Kavandane. “We should not just watch as insurgents behead people”.

It’s Black History Month, which is a good time to reflect on whose stories are repeated or forgotten, whose work is celebrated and why.
So today we’re highlighting the work of Delilah L. Beasley, an important — but largely unsung — black historian, a woman who spent years traveling the state to document black life in California.
In the Bay Area, Ms. Beasley might be best known for her work as an Oakland Tribune columnist — the first black woman to hold such a role at a major metropolitan newspaper.
But Dana Johnson, a writer and University of Southern California associate professor, said she was fascinated by another of Ms. Beasley’s achievements: her book, “Negro Trail Blazers of California,” published in 1919.",Black History Month: The Life of Delilah Beasley

https://dailynews.co.tz/news/2020-03-095e6642fc0620f.aspx,"MORE women now do jobs that were previously done by men at ports under the Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA), thanks to the purchase of modern equipment.
According to Dock Workers Union of Tanzania (Dowuta), in the past most of works at ports were masculine, thus women were by the nature of such jobs excluded from employment.
However, efforts by the fifth phase government to improve port efficiency by purchasing modern equipment have seen more women doing the jobs.
Dowuta revealed this when TPA women celebrated International Women’s Day in Dar es Salaam on Sunday evening.
The event was graced by Minister of State in the President Office (Good Governance) George Mkuchika.
“The 50:50 employment ratio between women and men at TPA has been made possible because we (women) don’t need to use energy to perform jobs. There is modern equipment,” TPA Dowuta co-chairperson Abiduna Athuman said.
She noted that in the past years most jobs required porters to do them, unlike now whereby machines had taken over. 
Mr Mkuchika said the government was for gender equality so more efforts were directed towards providing more education opportunities to girls through free education.
On the other hand, the government had increased the number of women in leadership and decision-making roles, noting that in this year women constituted 24.5 per cent of cabinet ministers up from 18.5 per cent in 2019.
Meanwhile, he said during the current government there had been significant change in revenue collection from the country’s ports, challenging TPA that it was even possible to increase more revenue if adherence to principles of good governance and ethics was increased.
During the event, Mr Nkuchika launched the constitution of the Association of TPA Women which so far had 400 members.
“I advise you to utilize this association to build capacity in female workers to increase number of women in leadership positions and decision-making bodies,” he urged.
Commenting, TPA Director General Deusdedit Kakoko said TPA would ensure there was gender equality in recruitment.
Currently, TPA has 700 female workers and 2,670 male workers.",Modern equipment prompts more women to get port jobs

https://thenewdawnliberia.com/cummings-life-is-at-risk/,"The opposition Alternative National Congress (ANC) has expressed fears here that their political leader Mr. Alexander B. Cummings life is at risk at his present quarantine center where he is being monitored for 14 days upon his return from the Bahamas over the weekend for a possible Corona Virus symptom.
Government has made a mandatory for anyone arriving in the country to undergo a 14 day quarantine. Though here have been some violations by government officials.
In a message to this paper Tuesday, Mr. Cummings’Chief of Staff Mariah, said the Government through the Liberian National Police Deputy Director Marvin Sackor has continued to harass her boss even at the quarantine center.
Mr. Cummings was compelled to be quarantined at the government held center, after an initial green light from officials of the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) that he could self-quarantined at home upon his arrival here.
Mr. Cummings aide said despite her boss’ security details following all of the protocols prescribed by NPHIL, staff and being in full compliance with no risks to their families, as they monitor the activities around the quarantine center, the Police Deputy Director insisted that they (security) get off the premises on Monday night, to which they refused.
According to her, the securities had argued that they could not leave their boss alone at the center.
Their refusal to leave the quarantine area prompted the Deputy Police Chief to have them quarantine as well.
“Today, the harassment continued and they have quarantined 2 of his securities in the same center. His life is at risk as it is now completely in the hands of a reckless and irresponsible government which sees him as their main rival. They can do anything to eliminate a formidable competitor and we cannot let that happen,” she alarmed.
When contacted Police spokesperson Moses Carter confirmed that Mr. Cummings security was ordered quarantined by the Deputy Police Director Sackor, after he entered the place where Mr. Cummings is being quarantined.
He said the fact that the security entered the quarantine center, left the deputy police director with no option but to order him quarantine.
Mr. Carter said if Mr. Cummings does not trust the police he should make that known rather than having bodyguards at the center with him.Mr. Cummings returned home on March 22, after traveling to the Bahamas to attend the Board Meeting of a Fortune 500 Com¬pany on whose board he serves as a membe¬r.He returned to Monrovia after a week in Gh¬ana.

Railways staff including workers involved in the facilitation of cargo along freight trains, which have been allowed by the Centre too are facing issues in being allowed to travel by the local state police causing significant disruption in supply chain for commodities across the country.
“Our staff across all zones is facing difficulties in reaching the terminals as they are being stopped by the local authorities. In many cases zonal Divisional Railway Managers (DRMs) have had to call the police and ensure they are allowed. As transportation has not been provided, they have had to walk all the way and some had to cycle. Even during the lockdown, railways have to ensure freight trains are running across the country so that supply is not disrupted. We are focusing mainly on food grains (rice, wheat, etc), vegetables and fruits, coal, cement, Iron, Steel, fertilizer, salt, petroleum products among other which are all essential commodities,” a senior government official said.
Allaying apprehensions following his address on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said people need not panic about availability of essential commodities and medicines during the 21-day nationwide lockdown. Following the announcement on the lockdown people had descended on the streets resorting to panic buying. At present, nearly 75% of total freight carrying fleet is stranded and unable to unload cargo.
“There are about 2.5-3 lakh trucks stranded on national highways right now as they are not being allowed to enter. There are millions of drivers who are stranded with no food or facilities even as the police have not allowed them to assemble in groups. There is anarchy on the roads. The drivers are unable to leave the trucks on the road as they are carrying expensive goods; raw material, finished products to workshops etc, but are unable to unload the goods as even the factories have shut down. The owners are also unable to provide any help as there is no transportation possibility. There will be a big problem as the trucking industry is the lifeline of the economy. The government needs to intervene,” SP Singh, senior fellow at Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training (IFTRT) said.
The department of commerce on Wednesday issued an advisory to states to keep units manufacturing food and essential items going and allow transport of intermediary goods. The advisory said states are to allow transport vehicles carrying raw material, allow workers to and from food processing units and facilitate inter-state movement of goods.
“Some movement of perishable items like vegetables was allowed slowly after the order came in,” Singh added.
While Centre’s order exempts the movement of freight through land, sea and air during the lockdown period, many workers involved even in the aviation sector faced similar issues of being unable to commute and harassed by the local police.
The civil aviation secretary late Tuesday wrote to all states asking them to allow the movement of airport and airline staff and crew during this period.
“Airlines/airport staff and crew are supposed to maintain specific/minimum facilities and need to be travelling to their working locations. The civil aviation ministry has received grievances from airlines and airports on the same…minimumnumber of functionaries of airports and airlines would also be moving during the suspension of domestic and international flight operations as basic facilities at airports and cargo/ emergency/permitted flight operations (including maintenance) have to continue,” the letter said.",Covid-19 update: Trucks ferrying essential goods stranded on highways as India locks down

“We’ll consider it,” Silver said in a courtside interview with NBA TV before the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat clashed in Game 2 of the NBA Finals in the league’s quarantine bubble in Orlando, Florida.
“I think it’s unlikely at the end of the day that if we start late that we would stop for the Olympics.”
The league’s 2020 season was upended by the coronavirus pandemic, shutting down in March and resuming in late July — more than a month after the NBA title would have normally been decided.
Silver has already said the 2020-21 campaign won’t start before Christmas, which means it will run through the scheduled 23 July 2021 start of the Tokyo Games, which were postponed because of the pandemic by a year.
“It’s not just a function of stopping just for the period that they would be competing over in Tokyo,” Silver said.
“They would require a training camp and they require rest afterwards.”
Silver was confident a decision not to pause for the Games would be weathered well by the United States, but he acknowledged that it could be tougher on other countries whose top players compete in the NBA.",Silver cold on Olympics

Ihekweazu, who stated this at the Presidential Task Force (PTF) briefing on COVID-19 in Abuja, said that despite the large population, the country had an opportunity to ensure the effectiveness of its strategy to combat the pandemic.
He said that Nigerians would need to stay physically apart to flatten the COVID-19 curve.
The NCDC chief said: “Nigerians are socially intense people, but we need to pay a short-term price for a long-term goal.
“Now, more than ever, we call on the people to observe physical distance while maintaining social connection.
“We have an opportunity to ensure our strategy is effective.”
He said that wearing of masks alone could not prevent the spread of COVID-19, adding that it should be adopted in addition to other recommendations.
“Even when we make a decision on face masks, that is not going to solve the problem.
“It will just be an addition to social distancing measures,” he added.
The Ihekweazu said that religious and traditional leaders had a role to play in giving accurate information on the COVID-19 pandemic.
He said that as Nigerians looked forward to the Easter celebration, there was a need for all to take responsibility in the prevention and control of the pandemic.
“Today is Good Friday, it emphasises the importance of sacrifice for a longer-term goal,” he concluded. (NAN

https://www.news24.com/amp/fin24/money/tax/explainer-can-i-claim-tax-deductions-because-im-working-from-home-20200404,"As more South Africans work from home during the coronavirus pandemic, the question arises of whether they qualify for tax deductions.
The short answer is ""it depends"".
Jean du Toit, tax attorney at Tax Consulting SA, told Fin24 that a home office will qualify for certain tax deductions if it is specifically equipped for purposes of the taxpayer's ""trade"" – in other words, how they earn an income – and if it is regularly and exclusively used for that purpose.
Generally speaking, he says, the Income Tax Act permits deductions for expenditure incurred ""in the production of income"" – that is, expenses incurred in the course of earning a living.
The Act, however, sets out specifically when such deductions are not allowed.
If a person earns their income from employment, rather than being self-employed, they are not allowed any tax deductions unless they earn that income mainly from commission or other ""variable"" remuneration, and their duties are mainly performed outside the employer's office.
If their income is not mainly from commission or variable payments, the duties of the work they do must be performed mainly in the qualifying part of a home – in other words, in an area of the home set aside exclusively for doing that work and on a regular basis.
""What is important is the word 'mainly', which means more than 50%. So, if you are an employee, then you can only qualify if you perform your employment duties for more than half the time at your home office,"" explains Du Toit.
""Given that the lockdown will not extend beyond six months (or so we think), it cannot be said that an ordinary employee performed their duties 'mainly' at their homes during the year of (tax) assessment.""
Therefore, he believes these tax deductions for working from home will likely not be allowed.
Making the most of your home office
The trend towards working from home and at home is expected to gain ground in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, and will make the ""home office"" a feature of many more homes big and small, according to Gerhard Kotzé, managing director of the RealNet estate agency group.
""Increasing urbanisation and traffic congestion has already been driving the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution, with rising numbers of consumers and employees using the internet to work and buy online and so avoid the stress, risks and loss of time and productivity involved in travelling to offices and shopping centres,"" comments Kotzé.
""But now we believe remote working will very rapidly become the norm for huge numbers of salaried as well as self-employed people, who have learnt just how much it is possible to achieve with a smartphone, laptop and high-speed internet connection.""
However, if you do have a home office it needs to be set up correctly to get the most out of it in terms of both productivity and tax savings.
""Having a dedicated home office may allow you to claim a tax deduction from SARS if you are a full-time employee who spends more than half your working hours in your home office, a commission-earner whose employer does not provide you with an office, or a small business owner or freelancer who always works from home, he says.
""To claim a deduction, you will need to have a specific part of your home which is used exclusively as your office and then calculate the square meterage of that space as a percentage of the total area of your home,"" says Kotzé.
""You need to check with your accountant or tax-practitioner for specifics, but generally, salaried employees are allowed to deduct from their income this percentage of the total cost of anything relating to the whole property, including rent or interest on a bond; any repairs to the premises; cleaning and maintenance costs; rates and taxes and wear and tear.""
Commission-earners can also deduct the same percentage of all their related business expenses, including telephone charges, stationery purchases, repairs to office equipment and courier services, for example, while sole proprietors and freelancers can deduct all their business expenses.
""If you have a home-based business that is registered for VAT, you can also claim VAT input credits on the costs of maintaining the premises in which that business is housed,"" says Kotzé.
""But you should be careful not to claim a VAT input credit on the cost of any additions or alterations you make to your property to accommodate a home office or home business. This is because, if you claim a credit for building work done to add an office, for example, or to convert the outbuildings, SARS will expect you to include VAT in the price of the whole property when the time comes to sell it.""
That means that, unless you could then sell your property for considerably more than the market average in your area, you would probably lose out on 15% of your sale proceeds, which would be going straight to SARS – and would likely be a much bigger amount than your original VAT credit, he adds.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/italy-closed-ports-ngos-boats-arriving-200409222037636.html,"Rome, Italy - Around 180 migrants remain stranded off the coast of Italy after the government closed its ports as a safety measure against coronavirus infections.
""We cannot stop migrants: if they set sail, it means that they have to dock somewhere,"" Salvatore Martello, mayor of the island of Lampedusa, told Al Jazeera.
More:
After a lull in the arrival of boats from Africa at the end of 2019, numbers started to pick up again in the first two months of the year - only to plunge in March as Italy suffered from its coronavirus outbreak.
But the trend could yet reverse again. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least six boats have departed from Libya since the beginning of April, carrying roughly 500 people, among them 150 later rescued by the German nongovernmental organisation vessel Alan Kurdi.
An order signed on Tuesday by several Italian ministers established that, for the duration of the national health emergency sparked by coronavirus, domestic ports could no longer be considered a ""place of safety"".
Even though international rescue vessels such as the Alan Kurdi are kept offshore by this new measure, small ships setting sail from Libya and Tunisia have continued to arrive on the Italian coastline.
Three wooden boats, carrying 34, 67 and 57 asylum seekers, each disembarked on Lampedusa this week.
""Arrivals are not decided by controls in the open sea or on African shores, but simply by the good weather,"" Martello said. ""And forecasts until Saturday are good,"" he added.
'No capacity'
Lampedusa is Italy's southernmost island, closer to Tunisia than to Sicily.
For those migrants risking their lives crossing the Mediterranean, these shores represented a safe harbour and the main door to Europe.
But the coronavirus outbreak is making their reception harder.
""The island does not have the capability of receiving migrants in the long run in full compliance with the health protocols required by the COVID-19 emergency,"" Claudia Vitali, a humanitarian worker for Mediterranean Hope, the reception programme run by the Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy, told Al Jazeera.
Italy requires any passengers disembarking to undergo a two-week quarantine.
In Lampedusa, recently arrived refugees have no place to go but the local reception centre. It can host only 96 people in ""normal"" times.
After social distancing became a requirement for every public facility, there is even less room available.
When the first 34 refugees docked on Monday, they were welcomed into the centre.
But the next arrivals had to wait the whole night in the harbour. Half were subsequently let into the centre, while the others were transferred to the mainland on a regular ferry line.
Health protocols
Italy's death toll from the virus rose to 18,279 as of Thursday.
With only 115 infections, the province of Agrigento, which includes Lampedusa, remained relatively safe from the spread of the disease.
The only citizen found positive on the island was a woman who travelled back from Bergamo, one of the worst-affected areas in the north of the mainland.
But after a month of lockdown, tensions are running high. While the newly arrived refugees waited to be transferred, a group of 60 people held a demonstration in front of the town hall.
Martello says the protest arose after three African men walked out of the reception centre for a stroll. Some citizens get upset at the sight of newcomers not abiding by the rules.
Martello understands their concerns, and he gives almost daily updates about any possible new infection. He also enacted a forced 14-day quarantine period for anybody coming to the island.
But he fears that new arrivals could inflame tensions further.
Since there is no more room to receive asylum seekers, he launched an appeal to the Ministry of the Interior and asked for a ""welcoming boat"" to be permanently docked in the harbour.
""There are health rules that must be abided by to protect our individual and collective safety, and these must be applied to everyone, migrants included,"" he said.
Mediterranean Hope has been monitoring the conditions of asylum seekers on the island since the aftermath of the October 2013 migrant shipwreck, when 360 people are believed to have lost their lives by drowning.
Vitali has been living on the island for 10 months, and agrees that preserving the health both of migrants and citizens represents the main priority for every organisation here. In her opinion, Lampedusa would not cope with a health emergency such as the one wreaking havoc in northern Italy.
But she believes that closing the ports is not a solution, and said, ""The coronavirus won't stop those escaping from violence and prosecution.""","Italy closed its ports to NGOs, but boats keep on arriving"

https://mb.com.ph/2020/04/27/second-wind/,"THE VIEW FROM RIZAL
By Dr. Jun Ynares
Last Friday, President Duterte announced his decision to extend the enhanced community quarantine period for several areas in Luzon up to the 15th of May.
Calabarzon, which includes the province of Rizal and the City of Antipolo, is covered by the President’s decision.
Some of our friends and fellow Antipoleños met the announcement with acceptance. They said they had “expected” it. At the same time, they felt they could “do nothing about it”.
Others met the news with heightened concern. According to them, they have a compelling need to get back to work. Others have to get back to work for economic reasons; others, for emotional reasons. The former said they are running out of funds and will have to resume their livelihood activities if they were to feed their families. The latter said they could no longer bear the long period of doing nothing much – of not being productive.
Then, there is a third group. These were people who said they are glad that the President had extended the quarantine period. One reason: they believe that the country – as well as other parts of the world – remain unsafe. They believe the possibility of a “second wave” of infections which, governments fear, could cripple not just public health systems but economies as well.
There is another reason: they said they have adjusted to the “new normal”. They found wise use of their time during quarantine, made themselves productive and, as one of them said, “turned their prison into paradise”. Many of them have migrated their business into the digital world and are now conducting flourishing business using their computers at the comfort of their homes.
This is the human quality called “adaptability”.
It is the ability of one of make radical and quick adjustments to situations that are quite different to what they have been previously used to.
This is part of man’s survival instincts.
We must tap into this instinct if we are to continue to thrive during these tough times.
All people in these three groups must have asked themselves how much longer the lockdown period would last.
The fact is, nobody knows at this point. We believe that the period may be extended again beyond the May 15 deadline. We do not know exactly when it would be safe again for us and for our children to go out without a major fear of being infected by the COVID 19 virus.
It’s time to revisit our tool box of survival mechanisms.
One is called the “emotional” or “psychological” second wind.
The “second wind” is something many athletes say they are, in a sense” addicted to. This is particularly true for runners and athletes who use their cardiovascular system a lot.
When these athletes perform, they use and burn energy. In the process, their bodies experience extreme fatigue. When that fatigue peaks, the body signals the brain to “stop” or “rest” or “give up”.
Great athletes know that they do not have to listen to that message. All they need to do is to cross an imaginary line that brings their bodies and mind from the state of extreme fatigue to a state called “second wind”.
Some of these athletes, especially runners, say that when one gets his “second wind” one has that feeling of renewed energy and a sense of indefatigability. Big word. It simply means “not susceptible to getting tired”.
Dr. Rob Bell, a “mental toughness coach”, shares four tips on how to get that second wind.
One, know your “why”. Find a strong reason not to give up.
Two, don’t stop. You have to keep moving to get your second wind. Here is where the saying “tough times don’t last, tough people do” becomes even more meaningful.
Three, find your rhythm. Or better yet, develop a new rhythm.
Four, be patient. Athletes never know when the second wind would come. They simply believe it would come. We get our second wind in life if we just hang on long enough.
In a way, in the “second wind” the mind takes over the body. It is a state of mental toughness.
We support the President’s decision to extend the enhanced community quarantine for many parts of the country which remain under serious threat from COVID 19. The President has a strategic vantage point from where he can see the bigger picture. We trust in his judgment based on that wider perspective available only to the leader of the land.
From our end, we will have to keep moving in our respective lives. We have to find a new rhythm. We will have to adjust. We will have to adapt.
The additional 15 days seem to be eternity.
Regardless, we can get to the finish line if we keep life’s rough race.
Our spirits can become indefatigable. We can run on our second wind.

Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email
Cape Tow - The country’s shopping malls will have to be substantially more flexible with tenants and shoppers in the post-Covid-19 era. That is the view of futurist Daniel Silke, who said: “When it comes to malls, the pandemic has ensured that it is now time for the survival of the fittest. Only those with deep pockets, good balance sheets and agility will survive the lockdown and the drop in sales that will follow. “Some money-making aspects such as parking fees will have to be reviewed or reduced to invite customers back into the malls, especially as money will be tight.” Cape Union Mart chairman Phillip Krawitz said: “There will be fewer customers in malls as people will tend to avoid large public spaces. This gives the opportunity to spend more time with every customer and to perhaps give a better shopping experience to our clients as they go to our stores. “Nothing will ever be the same again. Customers will come in and expect social distancing to be maintained, sanitisation will be extremely important, excellent service will dominate the entire theme, and care for our customers in terms of their safety will be a determining factor in terms of what stores will be visited.”
David Jenkins, the founding partner at Mickey Llew, a search engine optimisation agency, said: “People will still look for more comfortable desks and chairs to work from home. They want faster laptops for better efficiency now they are working remotely.
These are some of the things people will be searching for as time goes on, and businesses must optimise their online presence to cope with the traffic they need for future success. “Physical stores may contract in size in the near future as people opt for omni-channel engagement, where for instance the customer shops for a shirt online and just goes to the shop to try it on or to pick it up. Shopping is not going away, it will just be digital.”
Rudi Nienaber, the global Covid-19 response lead for Smollan, the retail solutions company, said: “Many of our malls are iconic retail brands in themselves, and they should be embracing online as such. In much the same way as they are physical landlords, they should be thinking of themselves as digital landlords, too.
John Davenport, the chief creative officer at Havas Southern Africa, a global advertising company, said: “Perhaps the most profound change to the world of retail will be the possible permanent changes in consumer behaviour.
“The adoption of digital shopping has been somewhat slower to catch on than experts predicted 20 years ago. Habits die hard. But people have been forced to change their behaviour when it comes to shopping.”

https://kathmandupost.com/sudurpaschim-province/2020/04/08/hill-districts-in-sudurpaschim-organise-grand-fairs-despite-the-nationwide-lockdown,"Every year between mid-March and mid-April, the holy shrines in the hill districts of Sudurpaschim Province see grand fairs (melas) and religious gatherings. These congregations see the sacrifice of hundreds of buffaloes, goats, pigeons and chickens offered to the gods.This year was no different. Despite the nationwide lockdown in place to prevent the outbreak of Covid-19, people organised several religious fairs in many hill districts, including Bajhang and Baitadi, of the Province.In Bannikot of Bajhang’s Chhabispathibhera Rural Municipality, many locals defied the lockdown and attended Banniki Chaitali Mela, which took place from March 24 to April 6. “Around 300 people attended the fair in the last two weeks. Locals of upper and lower Pathibhera also participated in the Banniko Bhakundo (football) competition,” said Ridam Singh, a local of Jayaprithvi Municipality. The local administration claims that until Monday, it was “unaware” of such a mass gathering taking place in Bajhang. Umesh Pandeyay, chief district officer of Bajhang, said that the local administration had directed the locals to not organise any fairs or gatherings given the current scenario. “We had asked the locals to not organise mass gatherings of any sort during the lockdown period. But I only found out about the fair on Monday,” said Pandeyay. The local administration sends security personnel to fairgrounds every year, but this year Pandeyay’s office did not since they were unaware of such an event taking place, he claims. “We didn’t arrange for security this year since we thought the fairs were cancelled. We are in regular contact with the chairman of the rural municipality, but weren’t informed of such events happening in the local unit. But now they tell me there were over 300 people in the fair in the past two weeks,” Pandeyay said. Pandeyay; however, claims that there were no outsiders among those who attended the fair in Bannikot. “We have deployed security personnel at all border points of each local unit. Outsiders are not allowed to cross the border and enter the district; therefore, I’m confident there were no outsiders at the fair,” he said. Meanwhile, Radhika Ratala Joshi, vice-chairperson of Chhabispathibhera, said the rural municipality had requested the locals to not organise the fair but their request was overlooked. “A team of health workers, people’s representatives and police personnel had raised awareness among the locals about the novel coronavirus and the ways to prevent its spread,” she said, “But the locals did not listen to our appeals.” Health workers in the district said there is a risk of the novel coronavirus spreading in Chhabispathibhera Rural Municipality given the large gathering the local unit saw in the last two weeks. Dr Milan Khadka of the District Hospital in Bajhang said the rural municipality should be completely closed off to mitigate the spread of the virus. “Every individual from the rural municipality will have to stay in quarantine now,” said Khadka. Similarly, in Baitadi district, a group of more than 35 individuals of Shahilek Bazaar marched to Jagannath temple to offer prayers on Tuesday. The temple, in Khalanga district headquarters, is adjacent to the District Police Office in Baitadi. But the security personnel deployed at the district border did not stop the group from making their way to the temple, locals say. Dilli Narayan Pandeyay, deputy superintendent of police at the District Police Office, said locals had informed the District Police Office that a group of not more than 20 people would visit the temple on Tuesday. “But we didn’t know the number would cross 35,” said Pandeyay. “We can’t do much to stop a march that large in number.” On March 18, the government banned gatherings of more than 25 people at a time, whether it be for cultural, social or religious activities.Ananda Paudel, chief district officer of Baitadi, said he was “unaware” of what happened in the district on Tuesday. “In a meeting organised at the local administration, we had directed locals to refrain from gathering in public places and not move in groups,” said Paudel. “We had also told them to maintain social distancing while offering pujas.” Doctors at the District Hospital in Baitadi say that group activities heighten the risk of the spread of coronavirus and that large gatherings must be avoided at all costs. Dr Basantaraj Joshi, chief at the hospital, said such mass gatherings can cause an outbreak of the virus. “Everybody who has been out in large numbers in the last two weeks must stay in self-quarantine. The chances of the disease spreading are high.,” said Joshi.",Hill districts in Sudurpaschim organise grand fairs despite the nationwide lockdown

The Tamil Nadu Class X State Board exams will now be conducted from June 15 to June 25. Tamil Nadu Minister for School Education K A Sengottaiyan Tuesday said the decision had been taken after a discussion with Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, Chief Secretary and other officials.
On asked what arrangements the government has made for students from containment zones, the minister said the situation will improve in the next 14 days, and that there are chances that many districts will come under the green zone.
“The government will make all necessary arrangements for students to write the exams without any hurdle. Not more than 10 students will be allowed to take up the exam in one classroom. There were 3,825 exam centres in the state and now it has been increased to 12,690. The exam centres will be within 5 km from the student’s residence and hence there are chances that the students will be taking up the exams in the schools they study in,” he said.
As per the revised schedule, the students will be taking up Language paper on June 15, English on June 17, Mathematics on June 19, Optional Language on June 20, Science on June 22, Social Science on June 24 and Vocational on June 25.
Sengottaiyan said the Class XII paper evaluation will take place on May 27 and it might go on for seven to ten days. The results are expected later that week.
The exams which were supposed to be held from June 1 to June 12 evoked strong criticism from opposition parties, teachers, and educationalists who questioned the necessity of conducting the exams under the pandemic situation. Opposition leader M K Stalin said that the government is putting the students and the parents under a lot of stress. He said, “No one is asking the government to cancel the exams but not to conduct in this panic situation.”

http://www.africanews.com/2020/05/25/au-57-anniversary-libya-crisis-covid19-faki-mahamat/,"The Chairperson of the African Union Commission, AUC; Moussa Faki Mahamat has bemoaned ongoings in Libya on the occasion of the AU’s 18 anniversary. Even though the AU formed in 2002 is 18 years today, its mother body, the Organization of African Unity is 57 years.
The AU chief in an abridged version of his AU @18 declaration posted on Twitter stressed the need to do all it takes to resolve the Libyan crisis.
Describing Libya as the principal initiator and proponent of the AU, he said the current crisis was the fault of all interested parties, some of whom continue to stoke the security and political crisis riddling the country.
“The tragedy being played out in Libya is of profound concern to us all. No-one is blameless in the failure, neither is any segment of the international community, which has a great responsibility in the persistence or even escalation of the conflict,” he stressed.
The AU has in the past few months taken steps to be more involved in helping solve the Libyan crisis. A high-level committee on Libya headed by Congolese president Denis Sassou-Nguesso met in Oyo, northern Congo and agreed on a Libya-led reconciliation process.
Meanwhile, the security crisis continues with the United Nations-backed government recording recent successes against the eastern-based government led by rebel Halifa Haftar. A recent Reuters report noted that the US and Turkish presidents had called for a de-escalation of the crisis.
Turkey has men on the ground in support of the Tripoli-based UN-backed government. Whiles the US and other gulf giants are believed to be supporting the Benghazi-based forces.
Twitter statement of AUC chair, Moussa Faki Mahamat
57 years ago, Africa laid the foundations for its unity that had been undermined by colonisation, by establishing a common organization, the OAU which became the African Union in 2002.
57 years after this founding act, Africa liberated itself from the colonial presence and apartheid. It initiated its political unity and made significant economic, social and cultural progress. However, such progress cannot conceal the sometimes flagrant shortcomings and delays.
We are constantly plagued, not without anguish ,by many questions. Has Africa become the continent of freedom, peace, prosperity and success that our Founding Fathers dreamt of? Has Africa gained a place commensurate with its immense potential and legitimate ambition in the international arena?
As Chairperson of the AUC, one of whose key commitments is to silence the guns on the continent, I am deeply touched by the sight of the current events in Libya, one of the founding members of the OAU and the principal initiator and proponent of the AU.
The tragedy being played out in Libya is of profound concern to us all. No-one is blameless in the failure, neither is any segment of the international community, which has a great responsibility in the persistence or even escalation of the conflict.
Against this mixed backdrop, there are glimmers of hope, fierce determination to overcome the odds and to break the cycle of dependency and poverty. Positive developments as well as spectacular results, have continued to emerge and pave the way forward.

AU president Ramaphosa speaks on COVID -19
Over in South Africa, president Cyril Ramaphosa who is also the current AU president in his weekly dispatch touched on the AU @18 celebrations but with a strong slant to the COVID-19.
“We mark Africa Day this year just over three months since the first case of coronavirus on the continent was confirmed. This pandemic has been a stark reminder that regardless of whether we are born into wealth or indigence, we are all mortal, and can succumb to disease.
“As countries around the world battle to turn the tide against the pandemic, Africa has taken firm control of its destiny, by developing a clear strategy and raising financial resources from its member states,” he noted.
He had earlier on Sunday announced the easing of a lockdown that had all but shut the economy since late March. Effective June 1, the economy is to be reopened as the country continues to battle the virus which has affected over 22,000 people so far.

https://mwnation.com/pupils-electrify-mzimba-school/,"The tale of self-made engineer Corled Nkosi, who electrified Kasangazi Village in Mzimba, has been told too many times.The young man generates hydropower using scrap-yard motors to show he is sick and tired of living without electricity to light homes and power electrical appliances in his village.Nkosi had no formal training when he planted his rusty dynamos on Kasangazi River to deliver power for all in his village and surrounding homesteads. It also powers some businesses in the rural locality.The 300-volts hydropower project has earned him the Commonwealth Point of Light Award from Queen Elizabeth II of Britain.As the village reaps the benefits of the Nkosi’s ingenuity, Kasangazi Primary School has not been left out.Nkosi refuses to keep the knowledge about electricity to himself.Instead, he is mentoring some young men in his village to take care of the power plantElvin Nyirenda, a 16-year-old boy at the remote primary school, is among Nkosi’s students.The Standard Seven pupil, who has received training in electricity generation, persuaded the group to electrify the school cut off from the national grid powered by Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi.He says the learners used to face numerous problems due to lack of affordable energy for lighting.“We were using torches powered by dry cells, which are expensive and short-lived. Even solar power could not supply reliable energy when the skies were cloudy,” narrates the learner.Selfless Nkosi is happy that the learners at the school—including his 13-year-old cousin Sankhani, now in Standard Five—are benefitting from the extension of his rural mini-grid.As envisaged by the innovator, electricity helps children in the community study until late in the night instead of going to sleep shortly after sunset.His famous contribution towards improving the quality of education has made him a hero in his community.To Nyirenda, the benefits are discernible.“Nowadays, learners who want to study at night happily do so without any problems. In the past, we were limited by the lifespan of batteries,” he says.Children in the country’s largest district, with villages far apart, often travel long distances to get to school.Learners preparing to sit Primary School Leaving Certificate of Education and Malawi School Certificate of Education (MSCE) examinations mostly lodge in self-boarding near the schools.The sight of MSCE candidates reading in the glow of light bulbs personifies how Nkosi’s electricity project is assisting secondary school students to improve their performance in school.The lighting also improves their security as they occupy some of the electrified homes in the village.School management committee member Doreen Mumba says girls in self-boarding settings are somehow safe from sexual attacks likely to expose them to unwanted pregnancies, child marriages and quitting school.“Besides, we are happy that the learners usually go back to school around 6pm for evening studies and special classes arranged to improve learners performance,” she says.The skills Nkosi has imparted to boys who took it upon themselves to electrify the school thrill school authorities.Chandiwira Chawinga, headteacher at Kasangazi, says it is amazing the rural learners have more time to study.He states that the make-up classes give teachers the ease to finish some lessons that would not have been delivered if the school had no electricity.“We appreciate that the young trainees felt it was important that their fellow learners benefit from the electricity Nkosi generates at Kasangazi,” he notes.In this way, electricity is improving the quality, equity and efficacy of teaching and learning in line with the Malawi Education Sector Improvement Project (Mesip).The initiative promotes equity and community participation to, among other things, ensure the majority of learners based in rural areas get access to facilities readily available to the urban few.Interestingly, communities surrounding the school have embraced the project and they contribute fully to various interventions, including electrification and the construction of learning shelters and changing rooms.The remedial classes initiated by teachers accelerate learning for children at risk of lagging behind in terms of learning outcomes.Fidess Msowoya, director of education, youth and sports in Mzimba, hails the spirit Mesip instils in community members close to schools.“The project is an eye-opener and its activities provoke the community to take up the challenge of developing their schools,” she says. “People are encouraged to do things on their own without being pushed or waiting for donors.”For Msowoya, this is vital for the improvement of education services in rural communities.“Schools with numerous challenges and those that were not producing good results have improved their grades and pass rates as well as retention of learners,” she says.Mesip national coordinator Chris Naunje is happy that the project is contributing towards enhancing the quality of education services in constrained schools. “With communities that understand the importance of education and are willing to contribute to improve teaching and learning, the performance can only get better with Mesip,” he says.",Pupils electrify Mzimba school

https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/06/economic-war-understanding-the-black-wall-street-and-redirect-mall/,"The leader of Africa’s first Economic War, Charles N Lambert, in a video released on Sunday, gave a detailed explanation of what the Black Wall Street and Redirect mall is all about.
In the video, Lambert gave a historical insight into the Black Wall Street and Redirect Mall as Economic Revolution. And I must tell you that the video is a must watch for any African seeking understanding regarding the pursuit of Africa’s economic independence as it provides the very first ideological transfer from African Americans to Africans.
Lambert explains the opportunities that come from the Economic War for an African who will apply to Work as an Internal Army in the Economic War. This provides an opportunity for you to have a full-time job and this earns you $ 5,000 per month upon confirmation by the organization.
The Economic War is focused on fighting for Africa’s Economic Independence, Economic Emancipation and as its first kind, Lambert refers to it as Africa’s first economic revolution.
He explains revolution as an attempt to try and change the status quo. Lambert further stated that if Africa can change its political status quo, gain political independence, we can also gain Economic independence, save the continent from being economically extremely poor and stop being dependent on foreign nations.
An Economic War, is a commerce-driven, orchestrated attempt, to balance altered trade deficit for a region. According to Lambert, this is done by simply ensuring that money leaving the continent is controlled, to avoid the haemorrhage of funds and capital flight.
Some African leaders have in the past attempted to save Africa from the haemorrhage of funds but failed due to the influence of the economic invaders that dominated African trade structure.
Now you can see that the Economic War movement is a revolution to lead Africans into economic independence and you must see yourself as a warrior that must win this economic battle for Africa by coming in as an Internal Army.
The Internal Army has five different roles and they involve over 600 people in Africa, and can be called the BWS600.
As an Internal Army, you will use the platforms that the Black Wall Street has put in place to strategize and fight the Economic War to help Africa recover and eradicate the deficit.
The Black Wall Street led by Lambert are a group of people who are dedicated to liberating Africa from poverty, they are the engine of capital generation for the industrialization of the African continent and leverages on capital flight to generate capital for funding of job, creating commercial undertaking for Africa which they’ve tagged ”The Economic War”.
A recipe has been tested and proven to be effective enough to help in the Economic War. This recipe is used to trap wealth inside of the community, you monitor the money, make sure it doesn’t leave the region to avoid capital flight.
The recipe was extracted from the backdrop of Economic Success of a group of people called “The Black Wall Street” who were racially and physically destroyed in the 1921 Tulsa race massacre in America.
In the summer of 1921, these worst episodes of racist violence in American history erupted in the heart of one of the most prosperous Black communities in the nation.
Dubbed “Black Wall Street” due to its affluent black residents, the Greenwood neighborhood of Oklahoma, where the Race Massacre took place, was a hub of Black success featuring Black-owned homes and establishments, including banks, restaurants, and hotels, in a community that included accomplished lawyers, doctors, and dentists. It was one of a few predominantly Black areas that thrived economically after the end of the Civil War and into the 20th century, when racial discrimination was the order of the day.
According to Lambert, this group of Africans who referred to themselves as the Black Wall Street became so prosperous and financially buoyant more than the whites who became upset with the success of the Africans.
History has it that the Black Wall Street community boasted more than 300 black-owned businesses, including two theatres, and even a pilot who owned his own private aeroplane.
The success of this black community, however, caused some white people in Tulsa to become envious and angry, according to Mechelle Brown, director of programs at the Greenwood Cultural Center.
The worst of it happened after an elevator incident between a 17-year-old white girl named Sarah Page and a 19-year-old black man named Dick Rowland.
Page worked as an elevator operator and Rowland would use the elevator almost every day.
On a particular day after the elevator doors closed and Sarah Page and Dick Rowland were alone in the elevator a few moments, there was a scream.
After the elevator doors opened, Roland ran and was later arrested. Page initially claimed that she was assaulted. The encounter sparked widespread outrage among white people, who rioted through Black Wall Street, burnt buildings owned by the blacks and killed over 300 black people.
It is on this backdrop that Charles N Lambert is championing the recipe of the Black Wall Street to be applied in Africa’s first Economic War.
Lambert believes that if these group of people were not killed and their businesses destroyed, they would have come down to Africa to industrialize the continent. And if the recipe they used 99 years ago could be applied in Africa’s first Economic War, Africa will be industrialized and restored economically.
Their desires, goals, objectives, passion, commitment, dedication, zeal, the height of their dreams would have been to implement the principles of the Black Wall Street for the entire Africa.
However, in applying the recipe to win the Economic war, to make sure excess money does not leave Africa, the Black Wall Street led by Lambert designed a platform called the “redirect mall” to sell African products to save the continent from losing over $203 billion on capital flights annually.
The Redirect Mall is an online Mall dedicated to fighting the Economic War. It is a place where Africans can buy African products in bulk as this will help retain the movement of money within Africa.
The Redirect Mall is to make sure Africans have easy access to goods produced by manufacturing companies in the continent. With the redirect mall, Africans can trap the resources and invest in African corporations to create more jobs for the people, thereby bringing industrialization to our doorsteps.

In another application from Shahdol district seeking information about recognition of private schools and qualification of teachers working there, the applicant was provided information immediately on two points listed by him.
But, as the applicant insisted on being provided the entire information in one go, the commission ordered the official concerned to provide the same within a month.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1302096/7-soldiers-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-negros-oriental,"DUMAGUETE CITY — At least seven soldiers in Negros Oriental tested positive for the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Dr. Liland Estacion, assistant provincial health officer, on Saturday said the seven soldiers of the Philippine Army’s 302nd Infantry Brigade were among the 11 new cases in the province.
ADVERTISEMENT
The soldiers were deployed in Cebu last March to help implement the community quarantine measures in the island.
Estacion said the soldiers showed flu-like symptoms upon arrival in Negros Oriental late last month. They are currently isolated at their brigade’s headquarters at Camp Leon Kilat in Tanjay City.
Another uniformed personnel from Barangay Agan-an in Sibulan town also contracted the virus after being deployed in Cebu.
The three other new infections involved Negros Oriental repatriates who live in northern Guihulngan City, Jimalalud town, and Amlan town.
The Guihulngan City native is a 36-year-old male who is the son-in-law of another active case, a 79-year-old man. They were both repatriated from Barangay Tisa in Cebu City which recorded a spike in coronavirus cases.
The new case was admitted in a private hospital in this city.
Estacion, however, noted that she could not yet determine whether or not this new case is a result of a local transmission as the patient and his father-in-law are both repatriates.
The Jimalalud native, on the other hand, is a 20-year-old male from Barangay Cangharay. Swab samples were taken from the patient as he previously showed coronavirus antibodies in a rapid diagnostic test (RDT).
The Amlan native is a 36-year-old female from Barangay Silab who arrived in Negros Oriental with her family through a private van from Mandaue City, Cebu on June 25. She was advised to undergo testing as she showed symptoms of cough when she arrived.
ADVERTISEMENT
She and her entire family are now under quarantine at the town’s government isolation facility. The municipal government earlier said it would have the patient’s family members undergo swab testing on Saturday, July 4.
A patient in this city was also reported to have recovered from the coronavirus after testing negative in a repeat swab test: a 33-year-old female from the village of Talay. Her 44-year-old boyfriend, however, remains infected with the coronavirus and is still undergoing treatment at a private hospital here.
Estacion reminded the public to avoid being complacent even as the province is now under a more relaxed modified general community quarantine (MGCQ).
“We should always wear masks, wash our hands, use alcohol, and observe physical distancing because this will make us less susceptible from contracting the disease or spreading it to others,” Estacion said.

AD
AD
While no country can afford to buy doses of every potential vaccine candidate, many poor ones can’t afford to place such speculative bets at all.
The key initiative to help them is led by Gavi, a public-private partnership started by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that buys vaccines for about 60% of the world’s children.
In a document sent to potential donors last month, Gavi said those giving money to its new “Covax Facility” would have “the opportunity to benefit from a larger portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines.” Gavi told donor governments that when an effective vaccine is found within its pool of experimental shots, those countries would receive doses for 20% of their population. Those shots could be used as each nation wished.
AD
That means rich countries can sign deals on their own with drugmakers and then also get no-strings-attached allocations from Gavi. Poorer countries that sign up to the initiative would theoretically get vaccines at the same time to cover 20% of their populations, but they would be obligated to immunize people according to an ethical distribution framework set by the United Nations.
AD
The donor countries are “encouraged (but not required) to donate vaccines if they have more than they need,” the document says.
“By giving rich countries this backup plan, they’re getting their cake and eating it too,” said Anna Marriott of Oxfam International. “They may end up buying up all the supply in advance, which then limits what Gavi can distribute to the rest of the world.”
AD
Dr. Seth Berkley, Gavi’s CEO, said such criticisms were unhelpful.
Right now there’s no vaccine for anyone, he said, and “we’re trying to solve that problem.”
Berkley said Gavi needed to make investing in a global vaccine initiative attractive for rich countries. Gavi would try to persuade those countries that if they ordered vaccines already, they should not attempt to obtain more, he said.
But he acknowledged there was no enforcement mechanism.
AD
“If, at the end of the day, those legal agreements are broken or countries seize assets or don’t allow the provision of vaccines (to developing countries), that’s a problem,” Berkley said.
Gavi asked countries for an expression of intent from those interested in joining its initiative by last Friday. It had expected about four dozen high and middle income countries to sign up, in addition to nearly 90 developing countries.
AD
Dr. Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which is working with Gavi and others, said they would be talking in the coming weeks with countries who had signed deals with drug companies to secure their own supplies.
One possibility: They might ask countries to contribute their private vaccine stockpile to the global pool in exchange for access to whichever experimental candidate proves effective.
AD
“We’ll have to find a solution because some of these arrangements have been made and I think we have to be pragmatic about it,” he said.
After a vaccine meeting last month, the African Union said governments should “remove all obstacles” to equal distribution of any successful vaccine.
AD
Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief John Nkengasong said Gavi should be “pushing hard” on convincing companies to suspend their intellectual property rights.
“We don’t want to find ourselves in the HIV drugs situation,” he said, noting that the life-saving drugs were available in developed countries years before they made it to Africa.
Shabhir Mahdi, principal investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial in South Africa, said it was up to African governments to push for more vaccine-sharing initiatives, rather than depending on pharmaceutical companies to make their products more accessible.
AD
“If you expect it to be the responsibility of industry, you would never get a vaccine onto the African continent,” Mahdi said.
AD
Last month, Gavi and CEPI signed a $750 million deal with AstraZeneca to give developing countries 300 million doses of a shot being developed by Oxford University. But that deal happened after the drug company had already signed contracts with Britain and the U.S., who are first in line to get vaccine deliveries in the fall.
“We are working tirelessly to honor our commitment to ensure broad and equitable access to Oxford’s vaccine across the globe and at no profit,” said AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot. He said its contract with Gavi and CEPI marked “an important step in helping us supply hundreds of millions of people around the world, including to those in countries with the lowest means.”
AD
Chinese President Xi Jinping has also vowed to share any COVID-19 vaccine it develops with African countries — but only once immunization has been completed in China.
AD
The World Health Organization has previously said it hopes to secure 2 billion doses for people in lower-income countries by the end of 2021, including through initiatives like Gavi’s. About 85% of the world’s 7.8 billion people live in developing countries.
Kate Elder, senior vaccines policy adviser at Doctors Without Borders, said Gavi should try to extract more concessions from pharmaceutical companies, including compelling them to suspend patents on the vaccines.
“Gavi is in a very delicate position because they’re completely reliant on the goodwill” of drug companies, said Elder. She said the system of how vaccines are provided to developing countries needed to be overhauled so that it wasn’t based on charity, but on public health need.
AD
AD
“We’re just having our governments write these blank checks to industry with no conditions attached right now,” she said. “Isn’t now the time to actually hold them to account and demand we as the public, get more for it?”
Yannis Natsis, a policy official at the European Public Health Alliance, said the last thing on the minds of officials in rich countries is sharing with poor ones.
“Politicians are scared if they don’t throw money at companies, the citizens in the next country over will get the vaccines first and they will look very bad,” Natsis said.

Addressing a programme organised by the Hindu Spiritual Seva Foundation through virtual mode to celebrate ‘Prakruti Din’, Bhagwat emphasised on the way of living followed by our ancestors who nurtured nature as an important part of their life.
He said people believe nature is for their consumption and that they do not have any responsibility towards it.
“We are living like this for last 200 to 250 years and its ill-effects and consequences are coming to the fore now.
If it continues like this, then neither we nor this world will survive,” he said.
In order to address this problem, the concept of the Environment Day came into existence, Bhagwat said.
“Our ancestors understood the truth of existence in its entirety and that we are one part of the nature and it is the responsibility of humans to nurture the nature,” he said.
“Our way of life was respecting all, but we were misguided by the world’s way of living. Hence, today we have to remember all this by observing the Environment Day,” he said.
Referring to the ‘Nag Panchmi’, ‘Govardhan Puja’ and ‘Tulsi Vivah’, Bhagwat said “all these ‘sanskars’ should be celebrated and rejuvenated, and the new generation will also learn that we are part of the nature and we need to nurture the nature and not just consume it”.
“If the future generation will think this way, then only we will be able to correct the harm done over the last 300 to 350 years, in next 100 to 200 years wherein the world and humankind will be safe and life will be beautiful,” he added.","Need to nurture the nature, celebrate sanskars: RSS chief Bhagwat"

UNWTO lauds Cambodia for responsible restart of tourism
The UN World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) secretary-general Zurab Pololikashvili commended the government for putting in place effective measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic while resuming its domestic tourism.
In a letter to Prime Minister Hun Sen on August 21, Pololikashivili thanked the Kingdom for its active involvement in UNWTO’s activities during the pandemic.
“We are delighted to see that Cambodia has gradually restarted its domestic tourism in a controlled manner and has put in place all the necessary safety and hygiene protocols as well as the requisite guidelines at tourist sites. This responsible restart is highly recommended by WTO.
“As you are aware, UNWTO is facilitating the reopening of tourism in cooperation with member countries and international organisations through the development of guidelines and recommendations for a safe and responsible restart of tourism activities,” he said.
Pololikashivili said the recent replacement Khmer New Year holiday had contributed to facilitating a safe and responsible restart of tourism in the country.
According to a Ministry of Tourism report, there were 1.45 million people travelling during the rescheduled holiday from August 17-21. Of the number, 14,000 were foreign tourists. Domestic tourists spent more than $100 million during the five-day holiday, the report said.
Cambodia Association of Travel Agents (Cata) president Chhay Sivlin said the UNWTO’s letter of appreciation could encourage international tourists to travel in the Kingdom.
“The letter is a positive sign for Cambodia. It showed that we have received international attention for carrying out safety measures well. We are happy as we have demonstrated that we can bring Covid-19 under control. It can encourage people across the world to consider visiting Cambodia,” she said.
Sivlin said during the holiday she had observed that Cambodians practised safety and hygiene measures well, especially at tourist attractions, with revellers wearing facemasks and maintaining social distancing.
The authorities, she said, had also prepared sanitisers for disinfection the virus and constantly reminded people to practice safety measures.
Within two weeks until Thursday, Cambodia had not recorded any new cases of Covid-19. Of the 273 cases recorded since January, 264 have recovered and been discharged from hospitals. No one has died from the virus.",UNWTO lauds Cambodia for responsible restart of tourism

Dar es Salaam. Chadema presidential candidate Tundu Lissu yesterday addressed a rally at the Zakhem grounds in Dar es Salaam ahead of the October General Election recalling the September 7, 2017 assassination attempt in which he was the target in Dodoma.
Mr Lissu - who arrived back in the country on July 27, this year after expressing his intention to vie for Union presidency - specifically thanked three people who rushed him to Dodoma Regional Referral Hospital for treatment immediately after the attack.
He named the trio as former Deputy Speaker (the late) Juma Akukweti’s daughter Khadija Akukweti, his driver Adam Mohamed Bakari and house help Amina Abdulrahman Kanyama.
“These are the people who rushed me to Dodoma Regional Referral Hospital immediately after the attack. Probably, without them, I wouldn’t have been here alive today,” he told a multitude who attended the rally.
Dodoma Regional Referral Hospital workers, those in Nairobi and Belgium, he said, did a lot to ensure his life was served including carrying out 24 operations and donating several litres of blood to him.
He thanked party chairman Freeman Mbowe and former Health Permanent Secretary Dr Mpoki Ulisubisya for standing firm to ensure he was sent to a hospital in Nairobi and not the MNH over security concerns.
“Although I carry many scars, I thank God that I’m alive. I thank everybody across the world for their role to save my life through prayers, blood donations and financial support,” he said.
Apart from that, he dwelt on the disqualifications suffered by opposition parties, disclosing that about 1,020 Chadema councillorship candidates were disqualified out of 3,754 aspirants filed in 3,955 wards in Mainland Tanzania. According to him, 53 candidates for parliamentary seats have been eliminated from election participation out of 244 hopefuls approved to contest the October 28 elections.
“They have been eliminated even before the election whistle has been blown. Candidate disqualification has been done unjustifiably against legal procedures and rules,” he said.
“In Zanzibar, as the chairman said, the opposition political party ACT-Wazalendo has suffered a similar blow where a total of 47 candidates including 16 from Pemba have been disqualified,” he claimed.
He further alleged that the country was witnessing multiple disqualification of candidates in its history since reinstatement of the multiparty democracy saying it was an intentional move to ensure CCM was declared winner without elections, a tactic, he claimed was applied during the 2019 civic polls across the country.
According to him, returning officers were implementing instructions given not to declare opposition candidates as winners because it was the government that pays them salaries and provides them withcars and other benefits.
Mr Lissu said party campaign rallies at all levels would start with peaceful protests to demand justice for barred candidates across the country.
“We call upon the National Electoral Commission (NEC) to dispense justice to Chadema’s disqualified candidates and all others from opposition political parties. We will protest peacefully, no stone will be thrown nor shots made,” he said. He instructed every Chadema candidate countrywide to conduct a peaceful protest to demand justice for the other candidates who have been disqualified for the October polls before bidding for votes.
During the maiden rally, Mr Lissu said they had no plans of boycotting the General Election, but he called for support of citizens so that all would be done fairly. “It’s true we don’t have money to fund our campaign, but we need your support for us to remain in the frontline,” he said.
For his part, Chadema chairman Freeman Mbowe said his faith in Mr Lissu was based on the fact that he was capable of treating all fairly.
“But to do so he will need the support base of enough Members of Parliament (MPs) and council members,” he said. He said Chadema would suspend launching its election manifesto until all those whose candidacy has been unjustly disqualified are reinstated insisting 2019 mistake would not repeat in this year’s elections.
“What this does it deny the majority citizens their right and freedom to vote. I have spoken to party’s presidential candidate as well as official communications with other political parties,” he said, adding: “I think there are important issues to deliberate before speaking of presidential, parliamentarian and councillorship polls.”
Party’s secretary general John Mnyika said yesterdays’ schedule included the launch of the Chadema election manifesto, but it has been pushed back until further dates over disqualifications of their candidates.
TBC drama
The state-run television live broadcasts had to be cut short after its workers were ordered out of the venue on grounds that they did partial coverage of the events as they skipped key messages by some speakers.
The broadcaster found itself in a difficult corner after failing to satisfy expectations of Chadema cadres, members, supporters and the audience following frequent stoppage as the event was going on. “You have 15 minutes to leave from this place,” Mr Mbowe ordered.
Later, yesterday, TBC management issued a statement expressing disappointment over Chadema decision, saying it has suspended broadcasting the party’s rallies following the treatment which was as per the electoral laws and guidelines issued by NEC.
The broadcaster further said it would report the matter to the police and NEC.
Internet network
Meanwhile, internet coverage was shut off when Mr Lissu started demonstrating before party cadres, members and supporters how to make financial transactions through mobile money to fund his election campaigns.
“Has network coverage been shut off? Let me describe and practice it on your own at home,” he was quoted as telling the rally.
Clerics
Both Islamic and Christian clerics who officiated the event prayed for justice during this year’s General Election, saying officials and law enforcement organs who will disrupt and defy electoral processes should be punished by God. They reminded presidential candidates who will be voted to hold offices to treat all fairly and pick up executives who will be ready to treat all citizens equally and equitably.
Clerics urged candidates to pronounce forgiveness even to those who subjected them to harassment and sufferings for God to usher his blessings.
“Mr Lissu, once you are blessed by voters in this election; pronounce justice and be a blessing to the people. I pray for NEC to declare true winners,” said Moravian Bishop Emmaus Mwamakula.

Like other former leaders who have quit the DA, such as Herman Mashaba and Mmusi Maimane, Moodey used his press briefing to target DA federal council chairperson Helen Zille in his criticism of the DA leadership.
Moodey has been a member of the DA since its formation in 2000, having first joined its forerunner, the Democratic Party, in 1998. Moodey said he no longer felt at home in the DA and was even struggling to sleep in a party T-shirt.

The W Health Month, aimed at improving community awareness on health issues that affect women and their families by bridging knowledge gaps, providing access to health checks and encouraging healthy lifestyle habits, will be kicking off with the Breast Cancer Awareness Sensitisation Campaign from October 21. Subsequently, women across the three states will have access to free breast screening from October 26 to 31.

Speaking on the campaign, Group Head, W Initiative Access Bank Plc, Ayona Trimnell, said, “Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women therefore, the need for awareness cannot be over-emphasised in the effort to fight and prevent the devastating and long-lasting impact of the illness on affected women and their families.
“While there has been considerable global conversations about this subject matter over the past few decades, many Nigerian women are still unaware of the importance and procedure for regular breast screening, which is a major reason Nigeria has one of the highest breast cancer mortality rates in the world. During this Women’s Health Month, and even beyond, Access Bank is committed to raising awareness, and providing medical support for women across the country.”
Established in 2014, the W Initiative has become home to everything Access Bank has to offer women, ranging from financial to lifestyle needs. Under the initiative, women and their families have gained access to a wide array of services including access to credit facilities to not only fund women-owned businesses but also healthcare needs. The ‘W’ community has also provided insights on family matters, health, career, lifestyle and finance, thereby enlightening women for a better tomorrow.",Access 'W' Initiative begins campaign against cancer

The CPI(M) held the seat for a decade until the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made inroads and clinched the seat during the 2000 assembly polls. The 2005 elections saw Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) shock everyone by winning Buxar but the BJP returned to power in 2010.
In 2015, the Congress staged a comeback after nearly three decades. The party aims to sustain its rule in Buxar for another term. However, Congress’ fight for Buxar during the last assembly poll was a neck-to-neck. Party’s Sanjay Kumar Tiwari wrested power after defeating BJP’s Pradeep Dubey by a margin of 10,000 votes. Tiwari managed to secure 41.43 per cent of votes while Dubey wasn’t far behind, bagging nearly 39 per cent of the total vote share.

While Congress’ candidate remains the same this time, the BJP has decided to field Parshuram Chaubey - former constable who was promoted as sub-inspector before he decided to opt for voluntary retirement. Chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) tried to stake a claim but the seat went to the BJP during the seat-sharing exercise.
The BSP had fielded Saroj Kumar during the last assembly polls. Kumar managed to secure 15 per cent of the total votes polled in Buxar in 2015. This time, as part of the Grand Democratic Secular Front (which includes the BSP, Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM, Upendra Kushwaha-led Rashtriya Lok Samta Party or RLSP), the party skipped fielding a candidate, instead, RLSP’s Nirmal Singh Kushwaha will take on the fight.

Looking at the trends, the electoral temperament in Buxar is usually hard to predict and often studded with surprises. The CPI(M) may have got lucky in the past and the BSP could turn the tide in its favour in 2005 owing to its influence in bordering Uttar Pradesh, but Buxar’s electoral polarity is likely to swing between the Congress and the BJP. One defining feature of Buxar’s electorate is its sizeable Brahmin population of over 2 lakh voters.
Buxar reported 57 per cent voter turnout in 2015 assembly polls. The district includes Buxar parliamentary constituency and four assembly constituencies - Buxar, Dumraon, Rajpur and Brahamapur.
The constituency will go to the polls in the first phase of assembly elections on October 28 along with 70 other constituencies. Counting of votes will take place on November 10.",Bihar election 2020: Congress eyes another term in trade hub Buxar

We do this with our innovative cloud platform that connects, automates and orchestrates supply chain technology, people and providers.We believe that retailers and logistics providers facing today’s new digital reality need to differentiate and scale their services to gain market share. Using data-led analytics and machine learning technology, we rapidly enable new fulfillment and delivery models that maximize customer experience, optimize operations and scale up the business.The team of Bringgsters is passionate about solving complex problems at a high scale. They are smart, innovative, creative, and push the product forward and make a real impact in the industry.Why Ukraine?

On the search for high – quality engineers that will be able to scale with the company’s and product’s growth, Bringg Identified the potential in the IT Ukraine industry, quality and experience of Software Engineers. This led Bringg to establish a new group that was quickly ramped up, becoming productive, operating independently yet as an integral part of Bringg’s R&D.Since starting the Ukraine initiative in January, Bringg quickly and successfully expanded to 26 employees that are operating as 6 teams in 2 locations (Kyiv and Lviv), promoting strategic initiatives that support Bringg’s growth.“My major goal is to deliver, but it has to happen with joy, smiling people, and friendships” says Shlomi Sasson, Ukraine Engineering Group manager. “Six years ago I decided to go out of my comfort zone, and to hire remotely. It was quite a hard decision for someone that used to have his teams around and a whiteboard in the palm of his hand, but as time passed I got a deeper understanding of remote management, that forces you of being more organized, make people more independent with a large toolbox to manage their work and be exposed to better knowledge.”The future

After achieving the Unicorn title, the next phase is to keep growing further, which inter alia, requires a lot of effort on the product development side, more generic features, more industry use-cases, and more capabilities for enterprise clients. All of this depends on a massive investment in product and engineering to make sure Bringg has the top-tier HR to fulfill that vision.Following Bringg’s success with the Ukraine R&D Center with almost 30 team members, they are already planning the 2022 strategy to increase the team to 50 employees.“My role is to make sure the site has a positive atmosphere and keep people busy with interesting activities at high delivery standards while everything surrounding them is superb”, says Ivan Matvieiev, Ukraine Site manager at Bringg. The employee experience starts from the hiring process which is optimized to respect the candidate time and encourages to share knowledge rather than being under a negative pressure, followed by a smooth onboarding with a quality welcome-box, top-level IT equipment, home-office budget and finally with clear and lean work processes.”Side to side with the Headcount growth, Bringg is also increasing its investment in employee experience, creating unit pride, increasing engagement, building growth plans for the employees, empowering managers and tightening the connection with the Israeli Dev Center.“This is the most important part from my standpoint, hire a new employee is a short term process, for the long term, it is our responsibility to make sure the employees are indeed doing valuable work, fulfilling their potential, coming back home happy, and can’t wait to see their coworking friends at the day after,” says Shlomi.The Ukraine IT industry is soon to see Bringg more presence in the space, which includes plenty of activities for both internal employees and brand awareness, a brand new office opened in Kyiv at the Creative States of Arsenal.

Britney Spears, Emma Watson, Janet Jackson, Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, Mariah Carey, Miley Cyrus, Rihanna, Shakira and Taylor Swift had nip slips, dress rips, panty bombs and Spanx flashes during galas, awarding rites and live concerts. The embarrassing moments that exposed to many people their undies, nipples and other private parts even happened more than once to a few of them.
Of course, non-celebrities also have their own versions of accidental public exposure though they would rather keep that in private. One American lady managed to avoid or prevent a potential wardrobe malfunction in an incident from which stars may perhaps learn.
Aubrey of Louisville, Kentucky was preparing for her wedding and ordered her gown online earlier this month. Unlike superstitious Filipino parents who discourage their bride-to-be daughters from fitting their dress before the wedding, believing it brings bad luck, Aubrey was shrewd and exacting. When the dress was delivered to her, she tried it on just to make sure that it fit right and satisfied her taste.
Upon looking at the mirror, however, she got upset with the way she looked in the white outfit. The simple appearance seemed dull and the ruffles misplaced. Being sleepless and tired from working two jobs, stressed from nuptial preparations and the pandemic, fashion-ignorant, as well as disappointed from her first online purchase, Aubrey immediately sent an angry e-mail to the dress supplier and demanded a fix or replacement.
The reply was even more shocking to the 33-year-old.
“You put the dress on inside out, please put it on the right way,” read the supplier’s email.
She did as instructed, and lo and behold, it was a beautiful wedding dress after all.
Aubrey decided to share her funny experience through a Facebook post that also contained an apology and thank you note to the dress provider.
One comment to her post informed her that wedding dresses are shipped inside out to protect the dress from stains, marks, or any other disfigurement or damage. Now she knows.
Clearly, the dress was not faulty. For the lady who was ignorant of shipping measures for formal dresses, her temper tantrum was a case of wearer malfunction.",Wearer malfunction
https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/550755,"LETTER | Of the RM322.5 billion crafted out as Malaysia's 2021 budget allocation, a miserly budget of RM24 million is all that can be squeezed out to foot the mental health needs post-Covid-19.Mind you, even the government has admitted the rising mental health cases. An alarming 35,000 distress calls to the Health Ministry's Psychological Helpline between March and October this year alone has been registered. With the unconfirmed, growing numbers of Malaysians losing their jobs, facing pay cuts and immense pressures on meeting monthly bills and finding food for the family, this all poses a tremendous emotional stress. Sole enterprises, SMEs and even some big corporations are facing unprecedented challenges to keep going, that is if they have not gone under yet. Add to this the economic and financial duress on the wage earner or business community, and we have untold social destabilisation being brought upon millions of citizens owing to a myriad of movement control measures that are enforced in the name of protecting health and safety and to curb the novel coronavirus cluster breakouts. While much of the budget allocations are being questioned or defended as premiums for the economic well being of the battered nation, citizens, meanwhile, are also being put under unaccounted loads of stressful living as they face a variety of enforcement on the streets. The compounds issued, the confiscation of vehicles, the warnings of raids on dwellings, the untold existence of bribery and corrupt law-keepers - all these are also placing tremendous emotional overloading in a restrictive climate seriously affecting human mobility and existence. The various forms of restricted movements - argued as a necessary price to pay for recovery - has punched huge cavities on the social, gregarious, efficacious nature of our citizens nationwide. Have we qualified or quantified these in order to implement measures that can speedily redress the damages? We do not have any investigative inventory to tell us how seriously the emotional, mental, social health and well being of our humans have been affected. The truth is, no one is talking about about the prolonged denial of effects of the measures being taken by the authorities; the parameters that are being changed on an almost daily basis in response to netizens point to flaws and gaps. A mere RM24 million allocation from the gargantuan RM322.5 million 2021 Budget allocation is a tell-all. In short, as the country remains glued to the mantra that recovering the economy will solve all problems, the social, mental and emotional well being of citizens will suffer in the meantime. The protracted restrictions on societal behaviour and beingness - one that has already stretched for a good eleven months now - comes at a huge cost. We need sociologists, psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers to speak up.

https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-astrazeneca-view/instant-view-astrazeneca-says-its-coronavirus-vaccine-can-be-around-90-effective-idUSL1N2I90FK,"(Adds Bangladesh health minister’s reaction)
Nov 23 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca said on Monday its vaccine for the novel coronavirus could be around 90% effective without any serious side effects, giving the world another important tool to halt the COVID-19 pandemic.
Phase III trial results of the vaccine developed by Oxford University found it was 90% effective if administered at a half dose and then at a full dose, or 62% effective if administered in two full doses.
But scientists cautioned against seeing this as evidence that it would be less useful than rival vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which each prevented about 95% of cases according to data this month.
Here are some reactions to the news:
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON
“Incredibly exciting news the Oxford vaccine has proved so effective in trials,” Johnson said on Twitter. “There are still further safety checks ahead, but these are fantastic results.”
BRITISH HEALTH SECRETARY MATT HANCOCK
“We hope to be able to start vaccinating next month,” Hancock told BBC TV.
“The bulk of the vaccine rollout programme will be in January, February, March. And we hope that sometime after Easter things will be able to start to get back to normal.”
He earlier told Sky News: “We’ve got 100 million doses on order and should all that go well, the bulk of the rollout will be in the new year.”
Hancock also said there was evidence in the report that the vaccine could reduce transmission of the disease.
“Now of course that would be very good news if confirmed, because obviously what we want to do is not only stop people from getting the disease but also stop its transmission,” he said.
PROFESSOR ANDREW POLLARD, DIRECTOR OF THE OXFORD VACCINE GROUP AND CHIEF INVESTIGATOR OF THE OXFORD VACCINE TRIAL
“That 90% is an intriguing result. So when we give a half dose as the first dose (it) means that we’ve got more vaccine available. And then... after the second dose we see 90% protection,” Pollard told BBC TV.
He said earlier: “We also have a vaccine that is going to be easy to distribute if stored at fridge temperatures, and we can get it to every corner in the world. It’s already been manufactured in 10 different sites around the world to make sure that that can happen.”
HARGREAVES ANALYST SUSANNAH STREETER
“There was little...enthusiasm for AstraZeneca this morning, as the efficacy rates for its vaccine fell short of rivals,” Hargreaves analyst Susannah Streeter said as the company’s shares fell as much as 2% in early trade.
BANGLADESH HEALTH MINISTER ZAHID MALEQUE “The big advantage of having the vaccine is that it can be stored, transported and handled at 2-8 degrees Celsius and we have that storage facility. We don’t have the capacity to preserve vaccines being developed by other companies such as Moderna and Pfizer at temperatures ranging between -20°C and -70°C.”
PETER LIESE, EU LAWMAKER WITH THE EUROPEAN PEOPLE’S PARTY
“The efficacy seems to be lower than with BioNtech/Pfizer and Moderna but the vaccine still has advantages. AstraZeneca uses a well-known technology, namely a so-called vector vaccine.
“Although I have great confidence in the projects of BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, it is nevertheless good that we also have a vaccine candidate that uses a different technique. It may be that the AstraZeneca vaccine is more suitable for certain groups of people and it would certainly be an alternative for people who do not accept the novel m-RNA vaccines. Another advantage is that the vaccine is significantly cheaper than BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna.”
JEAN-DANIEL LELIEVRE, HEAD OF CLINIC IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT CRETEIL HENRI-MONDOR HOSPITAL, FRANCE
“We are only seeing partial results here and we would need to know the exact number of subjects for each regimen. The trial also had to be stopped and AstraZeneca makes no mention of the incident in today’s release.
“Given that we are looking at a vaccine using a viral vector, we could potentially see an interference taking place with antibodies reacting to the vector and not to the virus. There are lots of small points for which we need more granular information to understand how this vaccine differs, in terms of efficacy, from the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.”
ZHU TAO, CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER AT CHINA’S CANSINO BILOLOGICS INC, WHICH IS DEVELOPING A VACCINE USING A TECHNIQUE SIMILAR TO ASTRAZENECA
“The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine results showed that with proper design, the adenovirus-vectored vaccine can also achieve 90% protection. The storage and transportation temperature of 2-8 degrees Celsius would greatly improve the vaccine accessibility.”
PASCAL SORIOT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ASTRAZENECA
“The vaccine’s simple supply chain and our no-profit pledge and commitment to broad, equitable and timely access means it will be affordable and globally available supplying hundreds of millions of doses on approval.”
PAM CHENG, OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE, ASTRAZENECA
AstraZeneca will have 200 million doses of its candidate vaccine by the end of 2020, with 700 million doses ready globally by the end of the first quarter of 2021, operations executive Pam Cheng said.
Cheng told a briefing that there would be 20 million doses in Britain by the end of the year, with 70 million doses for the UK by the end of Q1 2021.
PETER HORBY, PROFESSOR OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD:
“The reported efficacy of 70% is an interim measure and as more data accrue we will get a better idea of the protection it affords. Importantly, from what we have heard the vaccine seems to prevent infection not just disease. This is important as the vaccine could reduce the spread of the virus as well as protect the vulnerable from severe disease.
The Oxford vaccine can be stored in the fridge, as opposed to the freezer like the other two vaccines, which means it is a more practical solution for use worldwide.”
MICHAEL HEAD, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW IN GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON
“These results are intriguing, with two different estimates of efficacy depending upon the dose used with the vaccine.
“These are provisional results that have not been peer-reviewed and the study is ongoing, so as with the other recent announcements from Pfizer and Moderna, we should be a little cautious about these findings. It’s not yet fully clear why a half dose and then a full dose was potentially more protective but if the final results continue to show this pattern of around 90% effectiveness, this would allow greater vaccine supply not just in the UK but also globally.”
DANNY ALTMANN, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY, IMPERIAL COLLEGE, LONDON
“I think it is a real fool’s errand to start trying to pick these three (Pfizer/Moderna/Astra) apart on the basis of snippets of phase 3 data from press releases. For the bigger picture, my suspicion is that by the time we are a year down the line, we’ll be using all three vaccines with about 90% protection - and we’ll be a lot happier.” (Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge, Michael Holden, Kate Kelland, Sarah Young, Kate Holton, Matthias Blamont, Roxanne Liu and Ruma Paul; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)",INSTANT VIEW-AstraZeneca says its coronavirus vaccine can be around 90% effective

https://www.theindependent.co.zw/2020/12/11/statutory-instrument-281-radiates-a-stink/,"ZIMBABWE on Wednesday this week woke up to read about Statutory Instrument (SI) 281 of 2020: the Radiation Protection (Safety and Security of Radiation Sources) (Amendment) Regulations, 2020 (No. 5) which seems aimed to stop car imports from Japan but in reality could be another feeding trough for the elites in government and in the agency that administers the Radiation Protection Act.
Candid :Comment
nevanji madanhiire
nmadanhire@gmail.com
The SI had gone unnoticed for more than a week because it seemed innocuous enough and was not exactly new until its purpose became clear on December 8.
Gazetted on November 27 it sets new rules for vehicle imports. All cars imported will have to be tested for radiation and if contaminated, cleansed; both processes at a charge administered by the Radiation Protection Authority of Zimbabwe (RPAZ).
“In this case we have the Fukushima disaster that occurred in Japan in 2011. Most Zimbabwe vehicle imports come from Japan. So, we are now operationalising that legal instrument at Beitbridge, which will be our pilot port of entry. This will be rolled out to all borders in due course,” Rpaz spokesperman Chamunorwa Murava said.
As is well known, when the Fukushima nuclear disaster happened in 2011 and in 2012, the government, together with the Japanese embassy, assured Zimbabweans that car imports from Japan were safe. The official Herald newspaper carried a report on March 15, 2012 which said:
“The Japanese government has allayed fears that vehicles being imported from that country into Zimbabwe could have been contaminated by radioactive material following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March last year.”
What has prompted the government to change heart nearly a decade later?
Of course it is the money! The Rpaz is set to make about US$3 000 daily just testing the 200 vehicles that reach port daily: that is a whopping US$1,1 million dollars a year and if, which is very likely, every car is to be decontaminated at US$50 each that would rake in more than US$5,475 million.
That was too low a hanging fruit for the government to ignore.
But there is a huge problem. According to the Radiation Protection Act, 5/2004 (14) a: the Rpaz’s regulatory functions should be “effectively independent of other functions if that body is involved in both the management of radioactive sources and in their regulation”.
What this means is that the Rpaz cannot set up camp at border posts to do the testing and the decontamination. The reason for this provision in the Act is to avert corruption. The Rpaz could just simply declare every car, or most of the cars, contaminated, and get away with the malfeasance.
Studies elsewhere have shown Japanese cars are safe and the Japanese have assured the world that their vehicle exports are safe before distribution. They would be stupid not to do so!
Rpaz will not get any sufficiently contaminated vehicle at Beitbridge – just the money!",Statutory Instrument 281 radiates a stink

The country is deep in the bleakest period of the pandemic, with thousands of Americans dying each day. That reality is not lost on affluent remote workers, who are quick to express gratitude for their own good fortune. They feel guilty complaining about Zoom fatigue and social isolation when they are working in relative safety and comfort.

Yet with the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of two coronavirus vaccines, many of these remote employees find themselves imagining the new shape of their work lives in a post-pandemic America. Some glimpse a proverbial light at the end of the tunnel; others see an oncoming train.
In June, PwC surveyed 120 U.S. company executives and 1,200 office workers to see how they felt about that future. About a third said they hoped to work from home full time. About 9 percent wanted to work from home hardly at all. The majority preferred a hybrid workplace: two or three days at home in sweatpants and sports bras, refreshed with sleep, away from the stresses of office politics, then two or three days in the office, freed from the frustrating difficulties of making eye contact through a screen.

Companies are envisioning a new future for the office, too, with surveys finding 70 percent of employers expect to downsize their office space. Although such a move poses a potential nightmare for a commercial real estate industry already rocked by the pandemic, it could be a boon to workers for whom the expense of big-city living is now prohibitive.
Many supervisors now realize underlings can be just as productive, if not more productive, laboring away in yoga pants or pajama bottoms between bouts on the exercise bike and kitchen runs.

As a housing and mortgage industry analyst for Wall Street, Richard Koch spends his days in his Westchester, N.Y., condo interviewing companies about their plans. “Overwhelmingly, they say, ‘We are totally shocked and surprised at how well this is working out and how productive people are working from home,’ ” Koch, 62, said.
AD
Of course, he knew that firsthand. He had worked effectively from home full time for years before his new employer, in a compromise, offered him a hybrid schedule. Before the pandemic, he commuted to Manhattan three days a week and sat at a desk in the office “and did the exact same thing” he did at home. What was the point?
“I feel more relaxed. It’s easier to focus” working from home, he said. “There’s no office noise, no people stopping at your desk. I get more done.”
AD
The distractions in the office come with a price. Researchers at the University of California at Irvine found that the typical office worker is interrupted or switches tasks every 3 minutes 5 seconds on average. It takes an average of about 23 minutes after each interruption to engage fully with the task again, often leading to higher stress, bad moods and lower productivity, the researchers said.
AD
But for some, the ability to focus in solitude comes with a price, too.
Robyn Davis Sekula’s home lacks the joyful distraction of the Rev. Lee Hinson-Hasty, her co-worker at the Presbyterian Foundation in Jeffersonville, Ind. Sekula and Hasty collaborate easily on advertising campaigns and share a love of Jerry Seinfeld, church, family and cooking. “But I think what I love most about Lee is that when you are talking with him in person, you have his full attention,” said Sekula, vice president for communications and marketing. “He doesn’t look at his phone; he looks at you.”
AD
Of course, to see Hinson-Hasty again, she’ll have to leave Auggie — her 8-month-old black Lab-ish pandemic pup. “A year ago, I would have told you you were crazy if you paid for doggy day care. I didn’t understand people who treated their dogs like people,” she said. “Well, this year I fixed my dog his own Thanksgiving plate, and he ate in the dining room with the rest of us.”
AD
Even so, she can’t wait to get back in the office — never mind that “my dress pants and suits aren’t going to fit at all like the way they did.”
Sekula’s commute is 15 minutes each way; Heidi Schweingruber’s totals more than two hours a day. She’s now reclaiming some of that time strolling with her dog in her Columbia, Md., neighborhood, taking breaks to pull weeds or pick up prescriptions. Paradoxically, these small gifts of time have heightened her awareness of the dark side of remote work.
AD
“I talk to a lot of folks who seem to be having an issue setting boundaries,” said Schweingruber, 53, director of the Board on Science Education at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in D.C. “I saw something on social media that said, ‘We shouldn’t be calling this working from home. We should be calling this living from work.’ I was like, ‘That feels so right.’ ”
AD
Lessons she will carry back into the office (with any luck, no more than two to three days a week): “More awareness of the sort of point of diminishing returns and that boundaries matter, and breaks can actually make you more productive.” Also: “The importance of being there in person, that there really is something qualitatively different about that” that can’t be duplicated through a screen.
Without long experience and established work relationships, younger remote workers appear to be struggling the most. Forty-two percent ages 18 to 49 say this period has been difficult for them, compared with a fifth of workers 50 and older, according to a December Pew Research survey. Younger employees are also among the most likely to say that they lack adequate home office space and that self-motivation has been an impediment to getting things done, the survey said.

Brianna McCullough, a tech worker who lives in San Jose, believes that in the long run, the trend toward more remote work could help rearrange the rungs of the corporate ladder. For starters, it could make office politicking or the ability to live near the office in the city far less consequential to career success. But for McCullough, 27, working full time from home is less than ideal, she said.
AD
“I think a lot of the time, you draw energy from other people being energized,” said McCullough, 27. At home, “sometimes your motivation can run out pretty quickly.” Also, she added, there are no free neck massages.
Sarah Rosenthal, an architect at bwdarchitects in Falls Church, Va., loves setting up her drafting table just a foot off the living room floor and doing yoga stretches while her cat, Savina, weaves gently between her arms. In her quest to stay upbeat and creative, she’s inspired by the example of Sir Isaac Newton, who on a trip to the family estate during the Great Plague of London in the mid-1600s pondered the impact of falling apples, leading to his theory of gravity.
AD
“I try to be optimistic and see if I can see any apples falling from my trees,” said Rosenthal, 28. Even so, she thinks working at home is taking a toll on her career development.

“Architecture is a very collaborative process, and right now I feel like I haven’t really grown like I would have in the office” while overhearing her boss on the phone with clients or peeking in on other people’s projects, she said.
Micka gets it: Everything is such a mission now. No tapping a colleague on the shoulder if she has a question after a Zoom meeting. Even a virtual holiday party has been hard to arrange with co-workers spread across time zones. Micka excitedly imagines a return to the office that unfolds a lot like her first day. “People will look at me and say, ‘Who’s that new girl?’ ” she said.
For Hullman, the Northwestern professor, the pandemic has been unexpectedly renewing. Before the pandemic, “I was content to go to the office and meet with my PhD students and sort of give my time away,” she said.
Others’ work and concerns often came before her own. Now her creative juices are flowing.
In the office, she mainly did technical writing. At home, she is immersing herself in publishing op-eds and essays related to her research: “How we represent and communicate uncertainty in data.” Which has turned out to be quite timely. Whether predicting the course of covid-19 or forecasting who would win the presidential election, “people were acting more confident than they should have been, based on the data,” she said. “People really just want an answer. They want to round it up.”
Hullman finds herself sitting not altogether comfortably with the ambiguity of what a return to the office will bring. “What will work look like?” she mused aloud. “I think there is a ton of uncertainty there. I don’t know how to reduce it.”
For her part, she misses her students but hopes to preserve her newfound freedom and creativity by working more frequently from home.",Dreading or dreaming of a return to the office in 2021

https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-start-relay-hunger-strike-up-gate-border-blocked-briefly/story-EuqDVKiyly7anYraVoIQEN.html,"A relay hunger strike at Delhi’s borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate and Chilla – that the farmer unions had announced a day earlier, started on Monday as the protest against the three farm laws entered into its 26th day.
Farmer leaders said they have also urged the people of India to “beat thalis and other utensils at their homes” on December 27 (Sunday) and to boycott Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Mann ki Baat”.
“We also request everyone to skip one meal on Wednesday to show solidarity towards our movement. Between December 24 and December 26, farmers will take their protests to toll plazas in Haryana and will make them free for all. On Sunday, we will be beating thalis while the PM addresses the nation through his Maan ki Baat programme,” said Manjeet Rai, national president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Doaba).
Except Ghazipur(Delhi)-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border — where hundreds of protesting farmers blocked the entire carriageways of Delhi-Meerut Expressway and its service roads for nearly an hour in the afternoon — the agitation on Monday continued to remain peaceful.
Farmers at UP Gate said that the blockade was done to protest against the Uttar Pradesh administration that, they alleged, was stopping farmers at various places in the state and in Uttarakhand from marching to Delhi borders.
The sudden closure of the carriageways going towards Ghaziabad from Delhi triggered traffic jams on Monday. The blockade happened around 3.30pm, but was cleared an hour later, following a meeting of officials of UP administration with the famer leaders. The other carriageway — Ghaziabad to Delhi — is blocked by protesting farmers since Day 1 of their protest. The movement of only emergency vehicles is allowed through that carriageway.
At the Singhu border, 11 farmers, mostly leaders of different groups from Punjab, started the hunger protest between 9am and 11am on the main stage that is being used by the leaders to address the gathering. The same number of farmers sat on the relay hunger strike at the other borders as well, declaring that another 11 will replace the first group after 24 hours of fasting and this strike would continue till the government accepts their demands.
“Through our relay hunger strike, we want to convey a message that the country’s farmers “annadata” (food provider/farmers) are fasting for their rights. This strike will continue,” said Gurbaksh Singh Barnala of Jai Kisan Andolan.
Since the temperature saw a marginal increase on Monday, it provided respite to the farmers from the biting cold that they had been braving for the past few days. At many places, elderly protesters, who had been staying inside tents or tractor trolleys to avoid the cold, were seen sitting in groups under the sun, sipping tea and raising slogans against the government.
The Singhu and Tikri borders are completely blocked for any vehicular movement for the last 26 days. Hundreds of trolleys, trucks and four-wheelers are parked on both the carriageways as well as the service roads at the Singhu border. The fleet of vehicles and tents on the roads of the protesting farmers extends to nearly 6-7 kilometres into Haryana, while concrete and iron barriers with barbed wires atop, containers, and sand laden trucks have formed three layers of blockade put in place by the police to stop the agitating farmers from moving into Delhi.
Farmers write letters in blood to PM
On Monday, two separate NGOs from Punjab’s Ludhiana set up blood donation camps at the Singhu border. Some of the farmers were also spotted writing their names with their blood on white papers. Many of them also wrote letters in blood addressing the Prime Minister and requesting him to repeal the three farm laws.
“Nearly 70 farmers have donated their blood till afternoon and wrote their names and letters to the PM. The lists and the letters will now be sent to the PM either physically or through post. We hope the government will understand our pain, which they have described in the letters with their blood, and scrap the farm laws,” said Taranjeet Singh Nimana, who runs Bhai Ghanaiya Ji Misson Sewa Society, one of the two NGOs.
The blood donated by the farmers will be sent to various hospitals in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi to help the needy people, said Dr. Bhupinder Singh, who was leading a five-member team of doctors and nursing staff.
Fire scare
Later in the day, chief fire officer from Uttar Pradesh fire department Sunil Kumar Singh said that some dry grass and garbage caught fire in the forested area some distance away from the protest venue at the UP Gate border towards Delhi side in the evening.
“We already have three-four fire tenders stationed at the protest venue. One of them was parked closed the place where the fire broke out. It doused the blaze within 10 minutes,” said the fire officer.","Farmers start relay hunger strike, UP Gate border blocked briefly"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as he was addressing an Assocham event, once again reiterated that the laws are benefitting farmers and not otherwise as the opposition is trying to project. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar met agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and said a fresh round of talks may happen soon.

8. A group of volunteers at Singhu border has launched newsletter Trolley Times to dispel misconceptions regarding farm laws.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmer-leader-tikait-s-emotional-appeal-leads-to-fresh-mobilisation-in-haryana-101611945558680.html,"In a quick turnaround of events, farmers’ mobilisation in Haryana seemed to be heading towards reinvigoration on Friday as the ripples of protesting farmer leader Rakesh Tikait’s emotional outburst continued to be felt across the state. Amid reports of the protests petering out at various places, following incidents of violence in Delhi on Republic Day, Tikait’s emotional speech gave a fresh impetus to the ongoing agitation, especially among the Jat farmers of the state, said protesters.
Farmers from the Jat community seemed to be throwing their weight behind Tikait after his breakdown in front of television cameras, where he lashed out at the ruling party and appealed to farmers to not give up.
Mintu Ram, a farmer from Bhiwani in Haryana, who recently returned from the protest site at Shahjahanpur after nearly a month, said that fresh mobilisation was taking place in villages in Haryana in support of the ongoing agitation. “We returned from Shahjahanpur ahead of Republic Day. Since then, a lot has happened. There was uncertainty over the last two days but the developments at Ghazipur have changed the sentiments,” said Ram. He said that panchayats and gatherings were taking place in various villages to mobilise people in favour of renewing the agitation. “In nearly 15 villages in my neighbourhood, tractors are going around making announcements, asking people to join forces at protest sites.”
He said that the movement was gaining strength since people realised that attempts were being made to crush the agitation and the safety of farmers was under threat. “People from different villages are coming out in large numbers and proceeding towards Ghazipur and other protest sites. I will also return to the Shahjahanpur border. Many people from my village will be heading out to join protests by tomorrow (Saturday),” said Ram.
Prempal Singh, a farmer from Daultabad, said that while it temporarily seemed that the movement had suffered a setback after what transpired on Republic Day, the tide was once again turning in favour of farmers. “The farmers from Haryana were not involved in the ruckus that happened on Republic Day. It was a conspiracy by mischievous people who wanted to divide the movement. When Tikait refused to surrender, people realised that they had no reason to fear. They can see that attempts are being made to discredit the protests and are mobilising in support,” said Singh.
Deepak Sehrawat, a resident of Dhankot village, said that while people from the Jat community were in support of the farmers’ agitation, the support had increased since Thursday night. “Various WhatsApp groups are buzzing with updates pertaining to the farmers’ agitation and particularly what transpired at Ghazipur. Jats, especially, are more vocal about their support and will mobilise after Tikait’s appeal,” said Sehrawat. He said that the events that unfolded at Ghazipur had given momentum to the protests.
Protestors who were earlier camping at various sites said that they were unsure about the protests following the violence that erupted on Republic Day but were motivated by Tikait’s speech. His tears became a spark for the revival of the protests, they said.
Satnarayan Nehra, the president of Nehra Khap of Haryana, said that farmers of his Khap had vacated the sites on the Delhi-Jaipur highway at Sangwari Chowk in Rewari and Masani village near Dharuhera on Thursday morning and had returned to their base camp at Shahjahanpur. “Later we went to our respective villages after calling off the protest but we received calls from BKU leaders requesting for our support and asked us to hold panchayat in this regard in our villages on Friday and to motivate villagers to join the protest again,” he said.
There are 50 villages in Rewari belt dominated by Jats who have decided to support Tikait and to scale up the protests at all possible sites.
Ramkishan Mahlawat, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union, Bawal, said that more than 500 villagers from Bawal had joined the protest on Friday evening at Shahjahanpur and more than 500 others — who had gone to Jind in Haryana, where villagers had blocked the Jind-Chandigarh route near Khandela village — were also returning to the base camp. “Our aim is to increase the strength at the Haryana–Rajasthan border and to block the National Highway-48 to create pressure on the government as they are trying to vacate the sites with the help of villagers. However, we will not move an inch from here now,” he said. More than 50 protestors will head towards Rajghat, where they will sit on hunger strike for a day. They have written to Delhi police commissioner seeking permission but haven’t received any reply.
Kisan Mahapanchayat leader Rampal Jat, who had announced on Thursday that his organisation would vacate the Shahjahanpur protest site in wake of the Republic Day violence, returned to the site a day after. Jat, along with other prominent leaders of the area, reached Bawal on Friday evening and had decided to support Tikait at Ghazipur on Saturday. “We will follow instructions passed by BKU leader and will guide our farmers accordingly,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Rewari Police said that it had increased the police deployment at the Rajasthan-Haryana border again including eight companies of paramilitary forces.

There was confusion and anxiety in Abuja yesterday as the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) Ministerial Task Team on Enforcement of COVID-19 guidelines stormed Karu, a satellite town of the capital city and demolished some illegal structures, including drinking ‘joints.’
No fewer than 54 makeshift structures were removed.
Other structures demolished by the officials included containers being used by petty traders as shops and all the kiosks in a small market located in Karu site.
According to the building plan, all the extensions made in front of shops that served as drinking joints were also demolished.
Officials of the Development Control Department and COVID-19 Enforcement team, in collaboration with other relevant agencies under the FCTA, stormed the area with bulldozers and carried out the exercise.
Assisted by armed men, the officials demolished the fence of Paris Lounge and a container at Cool Leo. Both places are popular drinking joints in the area.
All the extensions in front of about four drinking joints on a street near the old NEPA office in Karu site were also demolished.

Some traders were seen struggling to salvage the little they could from their belongings trapped under the debris of the demolished buildings.
Others who saw the officials approaching were also seen struggling to remove valuables from containers before they were demolished.
The traders were still counting their losses as at the time of filing this report.
A trader who spoke with our correspondent lamented: “Where do I start from? All my wares were trapped in the demolished container. This is inhuman.
“This is beyond enforcing COVID-19 protocols. I am aware that some residents of this area have been complaining about the residential buildings being turned into drinking joints in this area.
“I have a strong belief that the demolition is not about Coronavirus alone”.
Speaking after the exercise, Acting Director, Development Control, Garba Kwamkur, said they got a marching order from the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, to get the city rid of miscreants, unapproved developments and make the city habitable for all well-meaning citizens.
Kwamkur said: “We are removing all infractions and unapproved developments within the city road corridors.
“It is a continuous exercise; we are going even up to Abaji that we have not been going to for some time. We are ready for all the satellite towns within the city”.
The Head, Media and Enlightenment of the task force, Comrade Ikharo Attah, said the demolition exercise was meant to sanitise Karu.","Pandemonium in Abuja as FCTA demolishes drinking 'joints,' others"

The fastest man in Kenyan Ferdinand Omanyala believes he can be the face of sprint in Africa ahead of Nigerian athletes when the 3rd Making of Champion (MOC) Grand Prix kicks off today at the Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH) in Lagos.

More than 700 athletes have reconfirmed their registration for the event as Kenya, Benin Republic and Togo are the three foreign teams adding international flavour to the meet which has Betking as its major sponsor.
Meanwhile, the University of Nairobi undergraduate who ran 10.11secs earlier this year is among the foreign athletes listed in the men’s 100m at the two-day meet which serves as an avenue for athletes to meet up the qualifying time for Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.
Omanyala told journalists yesterday in Lagos that he is ready to extend Kenya’s dominance in athletics to sprint events.
“I am so excited to be part of this tournament in Lagos especially with the weather which would help me to run faster unlike in Kenya which is a bit cold. I love the track and I can’t wait to compete against some of Nigeria’s finest sprinters. I know people think Kenya is only god in distant races but I want to change the attitude by becoming the face of sprint events in the continent. It promises to be exciting and I am looking forward to running another fastest time in Lagos,” the 25-year-old said.
According to Founder/CEO of MOC, Bambo Akani, the event would be staged in line with COVID-19 protocol as fans would not be allowed to be part of the event.
“We are excited about this year’s event especially with the presence of athletes from some African countries who are adding international outlook to the event. We are very happy to also announce Betking as the major sponsor this year and we hope they have come to stay with athletics. For this year’s tournament, we hope to get athletes picking their tickets to Tokyo as the results from previous events have always been ratified by the World Athletics (WA),” Akani said.",3rd MOC Grand Prix: Kenya sprinter taunts Nigeria athletes

In a letter to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) headquarters on Saturday, the GMDA offered it the land parcels for construction of a 28-lane toll plaza, which remained stuck for the last couple of years. The GMDA said that disputes have been cleared and barring a small patch, which was non-critical, it was ready to hand over the land.
The transfer of Kherki Daula toll plaza was announced by union transport minister Nitin Gadkari in 2016 — following repeated demands from the Haryana government and local politicians — but on the condition that land would be made available free of cost by the state to the NHAI. Initially, the plan was to shift the toll plaza to Sehrawan near Manesar, but the plan was shelved after opposition from residents and environmentalists.
Later, the state government identified over 30 acres at Panchgaon but this move was opposed by landowners, who approached the court for relief and the land transfer was delayed by almost three years.
The letter written to NHAI by Sudhir Rajpal, the chief executive officer of GMDA, states,” This is with reference to NHAI letter number 1733 dated fourth December 2019, providing for 28 lanes toll plaza in land measuring 30.92 Acres at Panchgaon in district Gurugram. The forest clearance for the said land has been obtained from the principal conservator of forest Haryana Panchkula on 31/01/2020. GMDA had already offered 30.92 acres land to NHAI vide letter dated 16/12/2019 for the construction of toll plaza with 28 lanes for which design has been prepared by the consultant of NHAI.”
“However, due to certain court restrictions, the site could not be physically handed over till now. Now, all the encumbrances on the site have been removed except for a non-critical patch of 0.40 acres. The land measuring 30.52 acres is now being offered to the NHAI for the establishment of a toll plaza at Panchgaon. You are requested to issue necessary directions to the local NHAI unit to take over possession of land for establishment of toll plaza at Panchgaon by shifting it from Kherki Daula,” it stated.
The Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL), the highway concessionaire that took over the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway in 2014 has a concession agreement to collect toll till 2023.
A senior NHAI official, on the condition of anonymity, said that the local project unit of the NHAI has not received any communication in this regard. “The GMDA must have written to the NHAI headquarters in this matter and the directions in this regard will come from there. We have not received any communication till now,” he said, adding that proposal for takeover of land will be analysed and necessary steps taken once the letter with necessary directions reaches the project implementation unit of Gurugram.
He said that it would take around six months to build a new toll plaza at Panchgaon, depending on the transfer of land and directions from the headquarters.
On March 5, union transport minister Nitin Gadkari announced that the Kherki Daula toll plaza would be shifted by August 15, 2021.

https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-vaccine-astrazenec/factbox-britains-astrazeneca-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-idUSKBN2BH0Z0,"(Reuters) - AstraZeneca said on Thursday its COVID-19 vaccine was 76% effective in a new analysis of its U.S. trial - 3 percentage points lower than the level in an earlier report this week criticised for using outdated data.
The following are details of the British vaccine:
TYPE OF VACCINE
** The vaccine is a recombinant viral vector vaccine, using a weakened version of a chimpanzee common cold virus to deliver instructions for making coronavirus spike proteins in cells, which will generate an immune response and prevent infection.
** Branded COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca and scientifically called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Serum Institute of India is making the vaccine, branded Covishield, based on the same technology to largely supply to low-to-middle income countries through the COVAX vaccine sharing programme.
DOSAGE AND STORAGE
** The two-doses regimen can be given four and 12 weeks apart in the UK, although tests have shown longer gaps could lead to higher immunity. Regimens vary between countries, as some also seek to delay second doses in order to give more people initial protection.
** The vaccine should be effective against the new coronavirus variants, AstraZeneca has said
** It can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions for at least six months, making it logistically easier to transport than some other vaccines.
EXPECTED PRICE
** The vaccine has been sold for between $3 to $15 in government and private channels in various regions, including Europe, India, and Latin America.
** AstraZeneca has said it would not profit from the vaccine during the pandemic. The company said it will look to profit from wealthier countries at an “appropriate time”.
TRIAL RESULTS:
UK, BRAZIL AND SOUTH AFRICA
** A late-stage trial of about 11,000 people showed efficacy on average of about 70.4%, based on different dose regimens four weeks apart.
** A longer gap, rather than a one-month interval, could lift the success rate of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine to 80%, a UK health official said.
U.S. TRIAL
** The latest data based on 190 infections among more than 32,400 participants in the U.S., Chile and Peru, showed the vaccine was 76% effective in preventing symptomatic coronavirus infections.
** Interim data published on Monday was based on 141 infections through Feb. 17, and pegged vaccine efficacy at 79%.
** The U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) then said the board charged with ensuring the trial’s accuracy and safety had expressed concern the company may not have provided the most up-to-date data, potentially giving an incomplete view of effectiveness.
** The shot remains 100% effective against severe or critical COVID-19 illness and hospitalisation and posed no increased risk of blood clots, the company said.
APPROVALS AND PRODUCTION
** The vaccine has been given the go-ahead with conditions or for emergency use in more than 70 countries. The company expects to apply for U.S. emergency use authorisation in April.
** Canada updated its label to provide information on rare blood clots associated with a low platelet count following a shot.
** South Africa has delayed rolling it out because of a lack of data on its efficacy against the highly contagious variant identified there.
** AstraZeneca has said it plans to produce about 3 billion doses this year, and aims to produce more than 200 million doses per month by April.
** It has manufacturing deals with at least 20 companies worldwide for different stages of the supply chain, from making the antigen to final fill and finish steps.

_x000D_
Last January, the 18,000-square meter SLF was issued two CDOs for violations of environmental laws, which include RA 9003 and RA 9275 or the Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004._x000D_
_x000D_
DENR Undersecretary for Solid Waste Management and Local Government Units Concerns Benny D. Antiporda, who made a surprised inspection of the site on January 27, gave the management of the Urdaneta SLF until February 2021 “to implement the improvements, such as constructing a water treatment facility, siphoning the garbage seepage, and identifying an ideal new cell, among others.” Rio N. Araja_x000D_

Antiporda even met with Urdaneta City Mayor Julio F. Parayno III and advised them to rehabilitate their SLF. “Magtulungan tayo. Tutulungan namin kayo para maging model ang Urdenata City sa solid waste management especially on SLF,” he added._x000D_
_x000D_
However, during a follow up inspection conducted on March 1 by the DENR regional office, it was found that the Urdaneta SLF has still not complied with the DENR order. There was no action taken by the local government unit._x000D_
_x000D_
 
 Antiporda said the engineered SLF “was given a grace period to correct the necessary violations, but they were not able to do so.”_x000D_
_x000D_
“With the marching order of DENR Secretary Cimatu to close all dumpsites by the end of March, the demand for SLFs increased significantly in several areas across the country. SLFs are a better alternative to open dumpsites, but this does not guarantee that they will be given the permit to operate right away,” he said._x000D_
_x000D_
“We want to send a strong message to all those who take the reminders for granted. We assure the public that we will remain vigilant so we will be able to protect the Filipino people and the country’s environment,” he added._x000D_
_x000D_
Around 169 open dumpsites are still operating across the country, based on DENR data._x000D_
_x000D_
To date, 107 open dumpsites have been closed down following Cimatu’s directive to close all open dumpsites by the end of March._x000D_

https://mb.com.ph/2021/04/30/ask-app-not-to-track/,"In 2010 D8 Conference, Steve Jobs was asked about privacy and here is what he said:
Privacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly. That’s what it means. I’m an optimist, I believe people are smart. And some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re going to do with their data. That’s what we think.
Apple’s iOS/iPadOS 14.5 come with the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature that does precisely that, but without doing it multiple times, ask users if they want the application that they are going to use to track them, hence waive their right to privacy. Apple is simply providing users a choice — yes, you, the user, will have a say whether you want a particular application to track. Let me repeat that — YOU, the user, is GIVEN A CHOICE.
Contrary to what Facebook is saying that this is about going against small businesses, or going against personalized advertisements, it is not about that at all. It is all about informing the user that they are going to be tracked, and allowing them to decide. Facebook DOES NOT want to inform users that they are getting tracked when they use applications that have Facebook’s trackers. Facebook DOES NOT want users to be given a choice! In other words, Facebook wants users to remain in the dark, not knowing how users’ data are being collected across the internet and outside of Facebook’s products and services. Facebook thinks users are dumb — yeah, Zuckerberg even said users are “dumb fucks”.
Giving users a choice
After you have upgraded to iOS/iPadOS 14.5, you need to check Settings-Privacy-Tracking and see if you can toggle “Allow Apps to Request to Track”. With this turned on, each app will ask you if you want to be tracked or to “Ask App Not to Track”. If you turn it off, applications will default to no tracking, and you will not be asked anymore.
Allow Apps to Request to Track setting
In addition to this, Apple has its own advertising that can be found on the App Store and Apple News (thinking where else Apple ads are found), and data that is collected based on your usage of the iPhone or iPad is used to personalize it. The data collected does not leave the device, but then again, it is still targeted advertising. Luckily, there is a setting for this, too, but not to turn off adverts (I still wish that Apple will allow us to kill those ads), but to turn off personalization. It is found on Settings-Apple Advertising and the toggle for Personalized Ads.
Personalized Ad settings for Apple Advertising
Personally, I have turned off both settings and when I select “View Ad Targeting Information”, it is empty.
Advertisements are not bad per se. Third-party ads are, because they collect your information and track you across the internet. Apple is providing users a choice on whether or not they want to be tracked. Apple is NOT deciding for users.

GUWAHATI, India (Reuters) - An earthquake of magnitude 6 struck India’s rugged northeastern state of Assam on Wednesday, causing cracks in the walls and floors of some structures, but no immediate casualties were reported.
The quake hit at a depth of 34 km (21 miles) near the town of Dhekiajuli, 140 km (86 miles) north of the main city of Guwahati, the United States Geological Survey said.
“This earthquake was the biggest I can remember, there was first a big jolt and then a smaller one,” said a police official in the town. “We did not receive any distress calls, but people did run out of their homes.”
People streamed into the streets for fear of fresh tremors, with some saying the quake left cracks in their homes.
“Our entire multi-storied apartment has witnessed massive damage with roofs and walls caving in,” said Subham Hazarika, a businessman living in an upmarket apartment in Guwahati. “Luckily no one got injured.”
Strong tremors repeatedly struck other northeastern areas and the neighbouring mountainous region of Bhutan.
“We don’t have reports of any casualties but we are seeing images and visuals of extensive damage,” Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told Reuters.
Earlier, the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) had put the quake’s magnitude at 6.2.
India’s disaster management officials were assessing reports of destruction and casualties, said one of the officials, who sought anonymity.
“I pray for the well-being of all and urge everyone to stay alert,” Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal told Reuters television partner ANI.","Quake of magnitude 6 strikes India's Assam, damages some buildings"

""Although the number of deaths is still a concern, I hope the number will come down by June 7,"" Sarma told reporters after reviewing the steps taken to counter Covid-19 at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH).
Assam is under curfew between 12 noon to 5 am till June 5. The same is between 2 pm to 5 am in the rural areas.
Assam has been reporting more than 5,000 new cases and 80 to 90 deaths daily since May 15. The state's rate of Covid-19 positivity, however, came down to 4.82 per cent on Saturday from about 10 per cent two weeks ago.

The state on Saturday reported 5,613 cases taking the total number of active cases to 54,948. A total of 77 deaths were reported on Saturday.
Sarma said a 300-bedded Covid hospital to be set up by Defence Research and Development Organisation and 200-bedded ICU facilities at GMCH was likely to be ready by mid-June.
Sarma, however, said the vaccination for people aged 18 to 44 years is likely to slow down in the next one week as the state only has 25,000 vaccines.
""I have already talked to Serum Institute, Pune and Bharat Biotech. We are likely to get 7 lakh vaccines by mid-June. The vaccination will speed up in July and August as we will get more vaccines.

Commenting on the formation of the Movement for Restoration of Teachers Affairs (MORETA), an organization aimed at spearheading the merging of teacher Unions, Zambia Union of Teachers (ZNUT) Secretary General Newman Bubala says the Teachers Union is in support of any efforts that will unite the teacher Unions in the country.
“Fragmentation is never beneficial. A united voice for the teaching fraternity will ensure concerted efforts and will yield more as opposed to lone voices.” Mr Bubala has said.
Mr. Bubala however, stated that ZNUT has not yet been engaged by MORETA and are keenly following the unfolding of events in the efforts being implemented by the Movement.
And ZNUT Director Human Resource Auster Kabalo reiterated that integration is necessary.
“One stick can be easily broken. But it is more of a challenge to break many sticks bound together. Coming together with unity of purpose will yield the teaching profession more results as opposed to the variety that currently exists.” Mr. Kabalo emphasized.
The National Union of Public & Private Educators of Zambia (NUPPEZ) also stated its support towards efforts to integrate trade unions in the teaching profession, but expressed unawareness of the Movement for Restoration of Teachers Affairs MORETA as the spearheading body to that end.
NUPPZ General Secretary Nelson Mwale indicated that the trade union was in support of efforts to unite the Labour Movement in the Education sector, but the Union was ignorant of MORETA’s efforts.

Among many protestors, the police detained former Mumbai minister Girish Mahajan, Mumbai BJP chief Mangal Prabhat Lodha, and MLC Rahul Narvekar. The police detained the protestors, who had planned for a 'chakkajam', before the march towards the Secretariat could begin.
The police said that all protestors have been taken to the Marine Line Police station, as per a report by news agency ANI.
""The MVA government has failed to protect the OBC's reservation. The issue can be solved through Centre Government's intervention, and our leader, Devendra Fadnavis can help with the same. The MVA leaders should come to him to take his help over the issue, but they would not come because they would rather delay it. It is a matter of credit taking for them,"" ANI quoted MLA Kalidas Kolambakar as saying hitting out at the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of the state for their incapacity to provide reservations.
""Today we are holding protests state-wide, at a 1000 places to pressurise the Government to expedite the process. Our demand is to restore the 27 per cent political reservation in all local body elections in the state,"" he added.
The plan to hold a statewide protest demanding the political OBC reservations was announced by the BJP on Thursday.

The Supreme Court had observed that the reservation in the favor of OBC in local bodies should not lead to the surpassing of 50 per cent cap in reservation quota. The apex court had rejected the state government's review petition concerning the political reservation.
The OBC had lost their political reservations in the local bodies of Maharashtra comprising of municipal corporations, municipal councils, zilla parishads, gram panchayats etc.
Earlier this month, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray after a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that the Centre is expected to take positive decisions on matters of Maratha and OBC reservation.

FAO said in the latest desert locust situation update that control operations continue in southwest Iran against hopper groups. It added that small scale breeding is likely to commence with the onset of the monsoon in July, but locust numbers should remain low.
“We are monitoring the situation as per FAO’s desert locust update, but the chances of a locust attack are very low, said KL Gurjar, deputy director of the Locust Warning Organization (LWO).

An LWO official said that the organisation is fully prepared.To further strengthen ground control capabilities,70 new pieces of equipment were procured from the United Kingdom to increase the number of ground control teams to 104. Additionally, 55 vehicles were procured to strengthen the control potential. He said that last year, to strengthen aerial control capabilities, drones, a Bell helicopter and customised Mi17 Helicopter of Indian Air Force were deployed. Drones were used for locust control for the first time after finalising protocols in coordination with the ministry of civil aviation.
According to a ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare report, a locust attack is not a regular phenomenon and large scale incursions occur characteristically in cycles of heightened activity for a couple of years, followed by long periods of inactivity. Locust attacks were reported in India during 2019-20 and 2020-21, examples of large scale locust upsurges, when locusts migrated to India after a gap of 26 years. During 2019-20, a locust incursion was reported in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Punjab, while in 2020-21, there was locust incursion in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.
“During 2019-20, Rajasthan and Gujarat had reported crop loss over 1,79,584 hectares and 19,313.14 hectares of land, respectively. During 2020-21, Haryana reported minimal crop loss, much below the norms of compensation. Uttar Pradesh has reported a very nominal crop loss over 202.9 hectares of land.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1454243/court-stops-town-from-closing-5-shipyard-firms-opposed-to-reclamation-project,"CEBU CITY––Owners of five shipyards have sought the court’s intervention after executives of Consolacion town in northern Cebu refused to give them permits to operate to pave the way for the plan to reclaim 235.8 hectares in consortium with a private corporation.
The Regional Trial Court in Mandaue City, Cebu on Thursday issued a status quo order after officials of Consolacion town promised not to close the shipyards until the main case was resolved.

“The municipality will not disturb the existing business operations of the petitioners until the main case is resolved,” said Judge Allan Francisco Garciano of RTC Branch 83.
Consolacion Mayor Joannes Alegado said in an interview that he didn’t want to inconvenience the shipyard operators and it was about time the foreshore area they were occupying is reclaimed and given to the next generation.
“I will not close the shipyards until December 31, 2021,” he added.
Lawyer Paulo Sucalit, Consolacion legal officer, however, clarified that what the parties agreed to was not to disturb the shipyards until the main case is resolved.
“We give our word that we will not close the shipyards nor will we issue a cease-and-desist order against them until this case is over,” he said.
The municipal government has planned to use the foreshore area occupied by the shipyards as part of their proposed La Consolacion Seafront Development Project, a 238.5-hectare reclamation project in consortium with La Consolacion Seafront Development Corp.
Shipyard owners learned about the project only last January when the mayor’s mother, Vice Mayor Teresita Alegado, held a public scoping about the project in Barangay Tayud.
When they applied for business permits, the validity was good only for six months, apparently in deference to the scheduled project inauguration in August.
When their business permits expired on June 30, the shipyard operators filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition in court to stop the municipal government from closing them down.
ADVERTISEMENT
Named respondents were Mayor Alegado and Judith Pepito of the town’s Business Permits and Licensing Office.
The petitioners were the Philippine Rigid Construction Corp., Fortune Shipworks Inc., Nagasaka Shipyard Inc., PKS Shipping Co. Inc., and Uni-Orient Pearl Ventures.
In their 54-page petition, they said their business permits were valid only until June 30, even if they had complied with the requirements for a full-year permit and paid regulatory fees and taxes.
When they asked for an extension, the respondents told them in a letter that they could no longer continue operating due to the expiration of their tenurial instrument and that their foreshore area “would be made a part of the La Consolacion Seafront Development Project.”
In their petition, the shipyard companies said the officials’ refusal to issue a business permit valid for one year was a “blatant contravention” of provisions under the law.
Under the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Service Act of 2018, they said all business permits were supposed to be valid for one year to prevent abuse.
They also pointed out that in previous years, they were not required by the municipal government to submit a lease agreement with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources for the use of the foreshore area and proof of ownership of their drylands.
They pointed out that the submission of a tenurial instrument for business permit application was not within the jurisdiction of Consolacion but with DENR and that it was not stipulated in their tax code.
The closure of the petitioners’ shipyards would result in the termination of at least 372 employees and lead to the “crippling if not destruction of the local and national shipyard industry.”
They said the closure of the shipyards in Consolacion, which serviced about 70 percent of the ships plying the Visayas and Mindanao, would not only affect the shipping industry but also the traveling public.
“The closure of petitioners’ shipyards would mean hundreds of vessels will have to look for other places every year for drydocking and afloat repair services,” they added.

In a time when much of the world has been stripped down to its barest essentials in the face of a global pandemic, even the simplest everyday experience can become elevated, provided that one approaches it from another perspective.
The act of washing one’s hands is perhaps the most popular pastime in recent times, pushed to the spotlight by strict health guidelines and raised awareness. Though seemingly simple, the act itself is one that spans countless eons, traced back to the dawn of humanity itself.
In these times, to return to nature is perhaps what soothes the mind from the hustle and bustle of the world, allowing us to achieve a much-needed semblance of peace.
Of course, returning to nature itself is out of the question for many, what with the limited mobility alongside logistic hindrances. A clear substitute attainable for many of us is art and design, which goes beyond our most basic needs to provide a better quality of life to experience.
At the same time, form does not necessarily hamper function, and a balance of the two can be found in a wide range of products, including those made by hansgrohe.
Evoking the natural splendor of clear water flowing from a mountain spring, the act of washing one’s hands is elevated into a transcendent experience with new hansgrohe Vivenis faucets.
Form and function: The Vivenis faucet is equipped with EcoSmart technology, allowing an economical water consumption of 5 liters per minute. (./.)
With its slender and discreetly curved spout, the hansgrohe Vivenis faucet emulates a gentle waterfall. The combination of the delicate handle with the extremely wide yet flat spout emphasizes the natural simplicity of the faucet.
Beyond the sleek design, the hansgrohe Vivenis faucet utilizes the innovative aerator with AirPower technology, enriching the water flowing out with air and enabling the WaterfallStream to create gentle and full-bodied water droplets. At the same time, both the environment and one's wallet are prioritized, with the EcoSmart technology allowing an economical water consumption of 5 liters per minute.
To match the varying moods of the space, the hansgrohe Vivenis faucets are available in three finishes: chrome, matte black and matte white, along with a number of faucet versions in different heights for the sink, bath, bidet and shower. To accompany the line, hansgrohe recommends the Pulsify shower range as an ideal combination and along with the Addstoris as an accessories range.",Turning handwashing into an entirely new experience
https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/07/19/uk-global-oil,"By Laila Kearney
NEWYORK -Oil slumped $5 a barrel on Monday, closing out its worst day since March, after an OPEC+ agreement to boost output stoked fears of a surplus just as rising COVID-19 infections once again threaten demand.
Crude oil’s year-long recovery has stalled out over the last two weeks due to the prospect of new supply undermining the case for higher prices. With the Delta variant of the coronavirus spreading worldwide – fuelling a 70% rise in U.S. infections last week – funds bailed out of long positions on Monday across multiple risk asset groups, including stocks and the dollar. (Graphic on U.S. cases) https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-TRENDS/dgkvlgkrkpb
It is still unclear how the variant will affect oil demand. Consumption in the United States, the world’s largest consumer of fuel, has steadily strengthened in recent weeks, but India, the third-biggest importer, has cut back imports due to oversupply and fears of reduced demand.
“The market is very fixated on the potential for the Delta variant exploding,” said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “Because of that, we’re getting a run on the bank.”
Brent crude settled at $68.62 a barrel, losing $4.97, or 6.8%. U.S. oil futures for August delivery, which expires on Tuesday, settled at $66.42, down $5.39, or 7.5%. The September U.S. crude oil futures contract settled at $66.35, down $5.21.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, known as OPEC+, reached a compromise on Sunday to increase oil supply from August to cool prices, which had hit their highest level this month in more than two years.
“We still face a significant deficit in terms of supply versus demand, but for now, the additional barrels are seen as enough to deflate and kill the recent rally,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital in New York.
Given heavier trade volumes – with Brent futures trading 167% of the last session – it appeared funds were selling off, Kilduff said. “It absolutely has the look of a speculative liquidation here.”
Some major banks have argued the market will continue to rally, with Goldman Sachs reiterating on Monday that it sees more upside. It said the OPEC agreement was in line with its view that producers “should focus on maintaining a tight physical market all the while guiding for higher future capacity and disincentivising competing investments.”
However, the OPEC deal removes more of the supply curbs that have been a cornerstone of the market for a year. At present, OPEC+ is keeping about 5.8 million crude barrels per day out of the market, a figure that will drop by 2 million bpd by year-end.
“Longer term, free and additional production capacities from OPEC+ countries are the key reason why we see oil moving lower again,” said Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke.
A popular spread trade in the oil market – between the first two December futures contracts, December 2021 and December 2022 – narrowed to the smallest since June 1. A narrowing spread indicates that traders expect supplies to rise by the end of 2021.","Oil piles on losses following OPEC+ deal to boost supply, rising COVID cases"

https://www.lusakatimes.com/2021/08/03/the-president-should-rescind-the-decision-to-deploy-defence-forces/,"By Henry Kyambalesa
Our brother President Edgar C. Lungu needs to promptly rescind his decision to deploy defence forces to quell political violence expected to be perpetrated by unruly supporters of citizens vying for elective positions in government ahead of the August 12, 2021 general elections. He should do so for two important reasons.
Firstly, the gallant members of our defence forces are not trained to observe the rights and freedoms of the citizenry guaranteed by the Republican constitution and are, therefore, likely to violate such rights and freedoms. As such, the President will do well to guard himself against being indicted by the International Court of Justice for any atrocities which are likely to be committed by some members of the defence forces.
Secondly, the deployment of our beloved country’s defence forces to deal with domestic issues and matters other than public emergencies and national disasters may not be constitutional. The Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) No. 2 of 2016 stipulates the following as the Constitutional functions of the Defence Forces and the Zambia Police Service:
Article 192:
(2) The Defence Force shall—(a) preserve and defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic; (b) foster harmony and understanding between the Zambia Army, Zambia Air Force, an auxiliary unit and members of society; and (c) cooperate with State organs and State institutions in times of public emergencies and national disasters.
Article 193:
(2) The Zambia Police Service shall—(a) protect life and property; (b) preserve peace and maintain law and order; (c) ensure the security of the people; (d) detect and prevent crime; (e) uphold the Bill of Rights; (f) foster and promote good relationships with the Defence Force, other national security services and members of society; and (g) perform other functions as prescribed.
Article 195:
(1) The President may deploy personnel of the Defence Force outside the Republic.
(2) Where the President deploys personnel of the Defence Force outside the Republic, the President shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable, inform the National Assembly of the deployment. (Note: The National Assembly is currently dissolved.)
There are also less-important reasons why the President needs to rescind his decision to deploy the military to perform non-traditional functions of preserving peace and maintaining law and order. Firstly, the presence of military personnel and cordons on streets is potentially going to worsen voter turn-out because timid voters will most likely avoid criss-crossing military personnel and cordons to go to polling stations.
Secondly, it is going to require a great deal of tact to send the military back to the barracks after the elections, unless it is the President’s intention to stay in power with the help of defence forces in the event that he loses the forthcoming presidential election.
Thirdly, engagement of the military to quell political violence before and during elections is likely to be interpreted by some military officers as an invitation to support the Commander-in-Chief and his political party against their political opponents—a situation which can easily get out of hand and culminate in unimaginable tragedy.
However, the President has unquestionable authority to deploy the Zambia Paramilitary Battalion, an auxiliary unit of the Zambia Police Service, to reinforce the work of the Zambia Police Service in maintaining law and order. There is a good reason why we have the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Defence as separate cabinet-level units of the Executive branch of government.",The President Should Rescind the Decision to Deploy Defence Forces

After spending months cooped up at home under lockdown, these city dwellers were no doubt excited to fly away and spend a real proper holiday by the sea once more.
“We are so excited to finally travel for a short holiday. We want to take this opportunity to enjoy ourselves while we can,” Jackie Koh told Malay Mail when approached three hours to the departure time.
The 51-year-old was waiting his turn to take the required pre-departure Covid-19 test with his wife and 20-year-old son.
Jackie Koh says he is excited to be travelling with his family for a short weekend holiday to Langkawi.
They had bought tickets for AirAsia's first flight of the day from Kuala Lumpur to the island, scheduled to leave at 9.50am.
Many travellers at the airport appeared to be couples, groups of friends and families travelling with their college-going children and dressed casually for their beach getaway. There were few families spotted with child adolescent-age or younger children.
Most of the group travellers were seen sporting only one carry-on baggage and one small luggage possibly to check-in. Couples were largely seen carrying only backpacks.
With today being a public holiday, many of the travellers appeared packed to spend an extended weekend on the island.
While it is advisable for passengers to arrive three hours before their scheduled flight, some travellers came more than four hours earlier.
Khadijah Riza Atiq who works in the financial sector said she was taking the opportunity to enjoy the plethora of travel promotions to the island with her friend.
“My friend and I decided to travel now and take advantage of all the travel promotion that is being advertised on the island. This way we can do our bit to help the local economy there while we are on a short holiday,” she said, her excitement palpable even underneath her face mask.
Khadijah Riza Atiq speaks to Malay Mail during an interview at KLIA2, Sepang September 16, 2021.
The 36-year-old related that her companion was so stoked for the trip that she made sure she was at the airport early even though their departure is only in the afternoon.
Another traveller heading to Langkawi told Malay Mail he and his friends counted themselves lucky to get on AirAsia’s first flight today as they had tried to book several other flights.
“We are so excited to get out of the city for a few days, just to experience a new environment and most importantly, seeing Langkawi’s blue waters.
“My friends and I tried our luck by booking several other flights to see which one we will get. We were lucky enough to get the first flight out to the island,” he said, declining to give a name.
Dylan Chan, 30, who was travelling with a college friend, said they were taking advantage of the travel bubble as a much-needed getaway was crucial for their mental health.
For Dylan Chan, 30, taking a short holiday after months under lockdown was important for his mental health.
“We won't know if there is a possible lockdown in the future so we are taking advantage of the travel bubble now for a short break. It is also quite important as this can help recuperate our mental health,” he said.
Malay Mail understands the budget carrier has three flights from KLIA2 to Langkawi today ― the other two flights were scheduled to depart at 11am and 2.10pm ― and all were fully booked.
At the main KLIA terminal, flagbearer Malaysia Airlines and another budget carrier Malindo, were scheduled to have seven flights for Langkawi today.
Malaysia Airlines told Malay Mail two days ago that it had recorded full loads for its KUL-LGK flights for the weekends and public holidays ― like today ― after the Langkawi travel bubble was announced.
The island off the coast of Kedah on the west coast of peninsular Malaysia is the first holiday destination to reopen to tourists under the government’s National Recovery Plan.
A traveller tests for Covid-19 using a rapid antigen self-test kit before his trip to Langkawi at KLIA2, Sepang September 16, 2021.
The Langkawi bubble is a pilot project by the government before it decides on reopening other domestic destinations for holiday travel.
Entry to the island has been stepped up for holidaymakers aged seven and above. Potential travellers need to obtain negative test results — either through an RT-PCR or RTK-Antigent swab test — 48-hours prior to travelling and produce evidence of their results at predetermined entry points at airports and ferry terminals before continuing on their journey.
However, travellers can also purchase self-test kits for instant results prior to departure.
A Malaysia Airport Holdings Berhad (MAHB) official told Malay Mail that the Covid-19 self-test kits using saliva were available for sale at RM19 each.
She explained that both KL airport terminals could handle up to 160 passengers at a time for Covid-19 screening and that the average waiting for each passenger was between 20 and 25 minutes, including 15 minutes of wait time for the results.
From Malay Mail’s observation today, KLIA2 has eight Covid-19 screening stations.
The MAHB spokesman said that travellers who test positive for Covid-19 will be isolated immediately and processed according to procedure before being sent to the nearest hospital for treatment.
In preparation for the travel bubble to the Island, the Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry announced various ease of restrictions by allowing activities such as water sports, snorkelling, scuba diving, fishing and activities on the beach.
The Langkawi Development Authority is also expecting the arrival of about 400,000 tourists over a period of three and a half months under the travel bubble programme. Of that number, 30,000 tourists alone are expected to arrive on the island by the end of September, with 2,000 expected daily arrivals.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/arsenic-from-irrigation-water-entering-food-chain-in-bihar-study-101632311857153.html,"Arsenic from irrigation water is entering the food chain in the arsenic-affected villages of Bihar. This has resulted in food with higher arsenic content than drinking water, a study by British Council and Union science ministry has found. It is the first time a study has found arsenic in locally grown food items – rice, wheat and potato – even though the presence of the chemical in groundwater was known for years. As many as 22 of the 38 districts in the state have an arsenic level above the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s permissible limit of 10 micrograms/ litre.
Bihar is the second most affected Indian state with arsenic contamination after West Bengal. Arsenic is naturally present in groundwater. In all, nine states in India are affected by arsenic groundwater contamination.
“The findings are alarming,” said Ashok Kumar Ghosh, chairman of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) and a member of a 12-member team that conducted the study.

He said for the first time, they have evidence that there is arsenic in food and its quantity was higher than that found in drinking water. Such is the vicious circle that water used to cook food adds to arsenic content resulting in cooked rice having higher arsenic than in raw paddy.
“We all have been focusing on the presence of arsenic in groundwater. Irrigation water was hitherto untouched. But our study has confirmed the presence of arsenic in the food chain in Bihar through irrigation water,” he said.
The reason for arsenic in food is that irrigation is dependent on shallow tube wells hardly 30-70 feet deep. Arsenic is present more in shallow water. Arsenic in water used by Shivshankar Prasad, a farmer of Bichoo Ka Dera village of Buxar district, is 336.2 micrograms/litre. In the case of fellow villager Kamlesh Yadav, it is 574.6 micrograms/ litre. The reason for this difference is that Yadav’s handpump is shallower than Prasad’s. And that is the reason Ghosh said that the only solution to the problem is deeper tube wells.
Quoting the study, he said, rice, wheat and potato have elevated levels of arsenic that can increase the disease burden of the exposed persons.
The study was conducted in 19 villages of arsenic affected districts. Ghosh said the study was exhaustive and is based on the detailed dietary assessment and estimation of arsenic in drinking water, cooked rice, wheat flour and potato collected from 91 households covering 19 villages. If the study is implied to all arsenic impact areas, around 10% of the state’s population may be consuming arsenic-contaminated food.
The study was funded by British Council and was recently published in the journal Science of the Total Environment.
Ghosh said that the study found that the presence of arsenic in the food chain was more pronounced in districts situated on the southern bank of Ganga such as Buxar, Bhojpur, Patna and Bhagalpur than those situated on the northern bank such as Vaishali, Naugachia, etc.
According to the study, the effects of high arsenic content is an increase in lifetime cancer risk, skin diseases like Keratosis, Melanosis and Bowen’s disease, etc.
“We focused on rice, wheat and potato because cereals, followed by vegetables and milk, form a staple diet of the rural Bihar. This is the first study where a detailed dietary assessment was conducted on arsenic exposed populations of Bihar to estimate the arsenic exposure from the three major staple foods,” he said.
The study also found that at least 77% of the surveyed households had an arsenic concentration in drinking water below the WHO guideline value of 10 micrograms/ litre. At least 37% of households reported some form of improved water for drinking, indicating that a significant proportion of drinking water in the studied population may have had arsenic levels lower than 10 micrograms/ litre, the study said.
In the homes, where arsenic in drinking water was within the WHO limit, the study found that the overall arsenic exposure was 36%, showing that the source of the chemical was water used for irrigation. The study concluded that arsenic in food was higher than in drinking water.
Ghosh said that although there is no fixed WHO guideline on the normal value of arsenic in food, the food had more arsenic content than drinking water. He said this was even when arsenic levels in drinking water were above the WHO provisional guide value of 10 micrograms/ litre.

The bat measures 56.10 feet, weighs nine tonnes and is made of poplar wood. This was to convey best wishes to the Indian cricket team and bring back the T-20 World Cup in Dubai.The bat unveiled in the presence of principal secretary, MA&UD and commissioner, I & PR, Arvind Kumar and principal secretary, I&C and IT, Jayesh Ranjan, was fabricated by the BSL and took almost a month to complete.“I feel proud to be part of this campaign and more so because Hyderabad is leading the way in conveying the best wishes to the Indian team in the T-20 World Cup,” Azhar said.“This is a superb effort and I am really glad to be part of this,” the HCA chief said while signing on the huge bat.“I think the India-Pakistan match tomorrow will be a very good match but I have a strong feeling that the Virat Kohli-led team will cross the line and go on to win the World Cup given the kind of form it is in,” Azhar said.He also appealed to the authorities to install the bat later at Uppal Stadium at a suitable location for the benefit of other cricket lovers.Mr. Arvind Kumar said it was a huge honour for Hyderabad to have this kind of a bat to express solidarity with the Indian team.“Diwali celebrations have begun early in the city with this unveiling,” he said.Mr. Jayesh Ranjan hoped fans would respond in huge numbers to lend support to India’s campaign. “I sincerely hope we will have bigger celebrations after India wins the World Cup next month,” he said.“We dedicate this bat to the Indian team that will be on display at this place till the World Cup concludes,” zonal head South India, Pernod Ricard India (P) Ltd, Udit Dugar said.Regional head, Telangana and AP, Gopal Akotkar was also present.

The contractor will construct the asphalt base and the surfacing of the slow lane on the N3 southbound (Durban bound). The middle lane of the southbound carriageway will be closed for use by construction vehicles during the construction period.Jason Lowe, Sanral’s Eastern Region project manager, said the concrete barriers will be moved across to the edge of the fast lane, and all traffic will be restricted down to one lane only, which means the fast lane, starting from just past the arrestor bed to 400m past the Peter Brown Bridge. “The asphalting operations will start from the southern or lower side and work up towards the arrestor bed,” he said.A temporary Variable Message System (VMS) has been installed before the Cedara offramp to warn motorists of the upcoming closure and to give them an option to use R103 as an alternative. “Only light motor vehicles are advised to consider the use of the Cedara offramp (R103) to Pietermaritzburg as an alternative as an alternative route,” said Lowe.The following are the conditions of the closure:•The closure of the middle lane will begin on 10 November 2021 and is scheduled to be reopened on 14 December 2021. •All vehicles will merge into a single lane in the vicinity of the arrestor bed and be controlled by synchronised traffic signals that will be in operation 24 hours per day. •CCTV cameras will monitor the traffic flow. The synchronised, manually controlled traffic signals will control the movement of both light and heavy vehicles into a single lane flow. •Due to this reduction to one lane, it is expected that a maximum delay of approximately 1½ hours will be experienced by motorists approaching Cedara during the morning peak period.“Sanral would like to apologise for the temporary inconvenience and disruption these operations will cause to the travelling public. “However, these are unavoidable maintenance works required to maintain the structural integrity of the N3. The construction team appreciates your patience. It is important to note that upon completion, the works will be of long-term benefit to all road users,” said Lowe.•",Reconstruction of the slow lane on the N3 on Town Hill

In Durban, parties still have almost two weeks before they have to remove their posters, while in Msunduzi Municipality, political parties have already had two weeks to do so. 

This means that from Monday, November 15, the Msunduzi Municipality can issue fines to parties.Msunduzi Municipality spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha indicated that parties had been alerted to the responsibility of removing their posters.She cited Section 3 of the municipal by-laws which deals with posters.

“Any person who contravenes or fails to comply with any provision of these by-laws shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine or imprisonment or to both such fine and imprisonment, or to such other penalty as determined by the court of competent jurisdiction,” said Mafumbatha.EThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said all parties must remove all posters and/or flying banners within 30 days of the local government elections.He explained that political parties pay R200 per ward and the number of posters was restricted to 800 posters per ward.

“In the event of any breach by a party, the municipality would contact the party concerned and the removal of posters will be carried out within two days after the party concerned has been contacted,”  said Mayisela.He added that failure to comply would normally result in the municipality removing the posters and recovering costs incurred from the party concerned at the rate of R50 per poster and the deposits made would be forfeited to the municipality.THE MERCURY",Political parties face fines if election posters are not removed

The underpass will be electrified from Friday after the NHAI got Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam’s (DHBVN) permission for electricity connection there on Thursday, said the NHAI officials. The highway authority used generator sets for lighting the road till now, and vehicular movements were closed there from 10pm every night.
Saurabh Singhal, NHAI consultant, said that they had applied for the electricity connections a few months ago. “We have received the permission for the electricity connection on Thursday, and now the underpass will be operational during night as well, as there will be light all the time. We were forced to close it for vehicular movement during the night hours due to the lack of power connection, but it will remain operational now,” he said.
The underpass near Ambience Mall was formally opened for traffic from November 1 this year, after the highway authority conducted a week-long trial to check safety and movement of vehicles inside the structure. Now, commuters do not have to go to Delhi’s Rajokri to take a U-turn, and can reach Ambience Mall and DLF Phase 3 in a shorter period of time.
The initial deadline for the completion of work at the underpass was September 2020, after it began on March 5, 2019. However, because of the government-imposed construction ban later that year due to pollution, and subsequently the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020, the project got delayed several times. The length of the U-turn underpass is 377 metres, and the entire stretch including access roads is 1.5-kilometre-long with a 559-metre-long and seven-metre-wide service road. The width of the underpass is 14 metres and the vertical clearance of the tunnel is 5.5 metres. A speed limit of 40 kilometre per hour (kmph) has been set on the facility.
A 455-metre-long flyover at Shankar Chowk, which was opened earlier in XXX (Month/Year), was also built as part of this project and a speed limit of 30kmph has been set for the grade-separated flyover.

https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/returnship-programmes-are-underutilised/article37892438.ece,"For all the buzz around returnship programmes for women, they remain an “underutilised trump card” in the war for talent — that is the main finding of a new study by Zinnov, a management consulting and strategy advisory firm. The study notes that while over one lakh qualified women professionals in India have left the workforce in the last five years for various reasons, only two per cent of them have been reintegrated into it. In a vast number of cases, there is no returnship programme for women; where they exist, only a handful of them are really effectual. The study has made this inference after combing through 40 returnship programmes in India for their best practices as well as the challenges encountered in running them. A majority of these programmes floundered in the area of having the right design structure to execute them. The absence of business alignment or a robust governance model has been the reason for a small number of these programmes fizzling out without ever having made any significant impact. The few companies that have been able to institutionalise their returnship programmes effectively, and at scale, have continued to reap the benefits, says the report.Back-to-work programmes for women have been in the spotlight during the pandemic, particularly because it has outlined the potential of remote work to widen the available talent pool. The study points out that “to actualise these programmes, organisations need to change their hiring mindset and create quantifiable impacts by aligning these programmes to business requirements.” First of all, organisations have to accord returnship programmes the status they deserve — the status of “a primary and sustainable channel of hiring” on par with other established channels, the study states. Hiring women on a career break should be as automatic a choice as is something like campus recruitment. The report observes that “a returnship programme requires a sponsor/champion, clearly allocated resources, and a strong design to give it the same predictability and success as a campus hiring programme.”The study notes that returnship programmes have evolved over time from being smaller cohorts to being not just bigger and virtual, but also gender-agnostic cohorts. They started with less than 15 candidates and were limited to corporate functions. Later, they expanded to include tech roles and allow any working professional to apply for the programme. During the pandemic, these programmes further adapted to move online and relax the requirements, which is shortening the number of career break years and work experience required. The study underlines that for the human resource team, getting the buy-in from the business side and the leadership for each cohort has been a challenge. Operational challenges include budget allotment and infrastructure.Sourcing qualified candidates, uncertainty over continuous requirement and lack of focus on building an effective upskilling curriculum are among the other challenges faced by companies, says the report. Around 17% women at the junior level enter a corporate career but only 3% of them make it to leadership positions. It is necessary for organisations to tap into this talent pool of experienced professionals to increase women’s representation in mid-senior levels.The report draws attention to a programme run by an organisation in the BFSI sector that hired women “across functions such as Operations, Technology, Finance and Risk, by establishing a clear work flexibility mandate and providing a supportive environment”. Some of the hires are at very senior levels, including CXO, the report points out. In a release, Nivedita Nanjappa, Head of I&D Practice, Zinnov, says: “Our experience has proven that design and implementation of robust programmes need a 360-degree alignment driven by top leadership. Strong business alignment, a well-defined governance model, an effective curriculum and design parameters will enable scale.”She adds, “There is enough data to show that women if integrated at the right time and equipped with the right tools, not only come back to being extremely productive, but also scale fast and become organisation builders in the long run.”

https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-the-devas-arbitration/article38195018.ece,"The story so far:  On Monday (January 3), Devas shareholders said they had won an order allowing seizure of $30 million worth of properties of Air India and the Airports Authority of India after a Canadian court’s order in connection with the arbitration award it had won against the Indian government. Both Indian entities have sought quashing of this order and the court has reserved its decision.
A court in Canada had ordered seizure of amounts collected by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) on behalf of Air India and AAI. Separate orders were passed on November 24 and December 21 on pleas by Devas’s shareholders. This is the latest attempt by Devas shareholders to enforce the arbitration awards it won at international tribunals after India cancelled the Devas-Antrix deal in 2011.So far, Devas has moved to seize U.S. $17.3 million of ticketing fees collected on behalf of Air India and U.S. $12.76 million of air navigation and aerodrome charges international airlines owe to AAI. Air India and AAI have sought quashing of the seizure order and the Quebec Superior Court held hearings on January 4 and January 5. The court has reserved its decision.Telecommunications firm Devas Multimedia signed a contract with Antrix (ISRO's commercial arm) in 2005 under which the latter would build and launch two ISRO satellites and lease the corresponding S-band satellite spectrum to Devas, which in turn would use it to provide its Internet services. Following a leaked draft CAG audit report that pointed to a number of potential irregularities in the deal, including alleged financial mismanagement and violation of standard operating procedures the UPA government cancelled the Antrix-Devas deal in February 2011 citing “force majeure"". However, the final CAG report and a number of other panel probes did not find any evidence of quid pro quo or bribery. Questions have also been raised about the calculation of losses by the CAG in the Antrix-Devas deal as it compared satellite spectrum with telecom spectrum.After the Devas-Antrix deal was cancelled in 2011, Devas Multimedia Private Limited and its shareholders won three arbitration awards at international tribunals. Despite the compensation awarded to Devas shareholders, India has not paid any money yet and challenged the awards multiple times. Devas says that in 2020 the BJP government agreed to a negotiated global financial settlement, but walked away from it and until India returns to the negotiating table, it has no alternative but to move against India’s assets globally.The first award on September 14, 2015 by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Tribunal, seated in New Delhi, unanimously rejected Antrix's defence of “force majeure” for cancelling the deal and held that it had wrongfully repudiated the agreement and awarded Devas U.S. $562.5 million in damages plus 18% interest per annum. ISRO's commercial arm, Antrix, has filed a petition to set aside the ICC award which is currently under adjudication before the Delhi High Court. In 2012, shareholders of a Devas arm incorporated in Mauritius moved the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) against India, alleging violation of the obligation to protect their interest as guaranteed under the India-Mauritius Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT). The PCA Tribunal, seated at The Hague, on July 25, 2016 found India liable for breaching its obligations. On October 13, 2020 the PCA Tribunal awarded Devas shareholders over U.S. $111 million plus interest as compensation. A third arbitration by one of the other shareholders of Devas —Deutsche Telekom (DT)—under the India-Germany Bilateral Investment Treaty at the PCA, won DT more than $132 million plus interest (in December 2017 and May 2020). Meanwhile, in January 2021, after a plea from Antrix, the National Company Law Tribunal ordered winding up of Devas on grounds of being fraudulent, which was upheld by NCLAT in September, 2021. NCLAT has also held the Antrix-Devas agreement to be illegal. Devas has moved the Supreme Court and its appeals are pending.
Devas's move to seize Air India assets comes just weeks before Tata Sons is set to take over the airline. However, the events in Canada are unlikely to hamper the transfer of the airline as Tata Sons has been granted indemnity from past legal claims in the shareholder's agreement. ""Expect a smooth transition by January-end,"" Kapil Kaul, CEO, CAPA India, said.

The country of 110 million people, which is battling one of Asia's worst coronavirus outbreaks, is holding an election in May for thousands of positions, from president down to hundreds of lawmakers, mayors and governors.
Roughly 67.5 million Filipinos, including 1.7 million overseas, are registered to vote in the elections, which historically have a high turnout.

""We need to push the virus cases down in April so when we have elections in May, people will be safe,"" Dr. Teodoro Herbosa, medical adviser to the COVID-19 task force, told Reuters.
""(It is) very important that we are able to tame this virus before May 9.""
Herbosa recommends the election commission expand the use of absentee balloting to include the elderly and people with health conditions.
Plans to extend the voting period to two days were shelved due to budget constraints.
The 2016 election saw a record voter turnout with 82%, with about 44.5 million people casting ballots, government data showed.
Daily coronavirus infections have hit records several times this month, driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant, prompting a tightening of mobility curbs. On Monday, the Philippines started a ban on unvaccinated people from public transport.
The country has recorded more than 3.24 million cases and nearly 53,000 deaths overall.
It has so far fully inoculated about half of its population, but many areas outside the capital region are lagging behind.

https://www.herald.co.zw/december-monthly-budget-surges-6pc/,"ZIMBABWE’S average Total Consumption Poverty Line (TCPL), monthly expenditure needs, for an individual surged 6 percent to $8 008 in December 2021, the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (Zimstat) says.Importantly though, it should be taken into account that Zimbabwe’s monthly consumer price inflation surged by 5,8 percent, exactly the same margin by which prices increased the prior month.According to ZimStats, the TCPL represents the least amount of money an individual or family needs to cover their food, rentals, clothing, and other essentials.Last month’s TCPL figure was, however, recorded when Zimbabwe was going through a rampant and at times unjustified increase in prices.The period usually sees speculators and unscrupulous business practices, as traders seek to capitalise on the high spending usually associated with the festive season.Notably though, the Total Consumption Poverty Line may differ from place to place as prices vary across the country.Mashonaland Central concluded the year as the most expensive province in the country, as its individual TCPL stood at $9 046  month of December.Mashonaland East and Matabeleland North were the second and third most expensive provinces in the country as their total individual consumption requirements stood at $8 928 and $8 793 respectively.Matabeleland South was the least expensive province with a total consumption line per person of $6 775 while the Midlands’ was  $7 354 for the monthly needs.Bulawayo was the more expensive of Zimbabwe’s two metropolitan provinces with a TCPL of $8779, compared to Harare’s $8 025 needed to meet individual requirements for a month.On the flip side, Zimbabwe’s average Food Poverty Line (FPL) for an individual grew by 6,2 percent to $5 761 in December from November‘s $5 423.ZimStats defines Food Poverty Line as the amount of money that an individual will need to afford the minimum required daily energy intake of 2 100 calories.Matabeleland North was the most expensive in this segment trailed by Manicaland as the provinces needed $6 324 and $6 316 respectively for monthly food needs for an individual.Matabeleland South proved to be the least expensive province in the country, as it recorded an FPL of $4 540.With an FPL of $5 290, Mashonaland West was the second cheapest province in the country in the month of December.At $5 863, Bulawayo was again the expense of the two metropolitan provinces as Harare’s FPL for the month of December stood at $5 310.The Poverty Datum line represents the cost of a given standard of living that must be reached if a person is to be considered not poor, and an individual whose total consumption expenditure does not exceed the Food Poverty Line is deemed to be very poor.",December monthly budget surges 6pc

https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-middle-seat-in-cars-will-need-y-shaped-belts-101644256202049.html,"The government will soon make it mandatory for automobile makers to provide three-point safety belts for all seats in a passenger car, including the middle rear seat, officials privy to the development said on Monday. At present, only the front and rear window seats have three-point seat belts, also known as Y-shaped belts. The middle rear seats in most cars have a belt similar to aircraft seat belts that go over the lap.
Although not wearing seat belts in cars is a punishable traffic offence in India for decades now, it is not enforced largely for passengers in the rear.
The transport ministry will issue a draft notification in this regard in about a month, and seek suggestions and comments from the public, officials said.
“The intention of the government is to improve the overall safety ratings of passenger cars manufactured in India. The ministry found that barring a few models, no vehicle has three-point seat belts for the passenger seated in the rear middle in India,” a ministry official said, asking not to be named.
“They only have a lap belt, which we found is hardly effective in case of a crash, thus putting the passenger at great risk.”
The three-point seat belt, innovated by Swedish carmaker Volvo and made available to all in the interest of public safety, has been proven to be safer than the lap belt because it evenly spreads out the energy of a moving body over the chest, shoulders and pelvis at the time of a collision, resulting in lesser injuries.
This will be the second intervention to make cars safer after the government recently proposed to make six air bags mandatory for all passenger vehicles, a second official said.
The transport ministry on January 14 issued a draft notification seeking comments from the public on making six air bags mandatory that will be implemented from October 1.
Experts welcomed the move to improve safety but said it would be effective only if passengers obey the rule of wearing belts in the rear. Almost 90% of passengers in the rear seat of cars in India do not wear safety belts, they said.
More than 30% of the fatal crashes investigated by SaveLIFE Foundation across various highways involved injuries suffered by passengers who were not wearing belts in the rear seats, said Piyush Tewari, chief executive of the non-profit that promotes greater road safety.
“In a recent case involving seven fatalities in a single vehicle, it emerged that not a single passenger was wearing a seat belt, as a result of which all seven were ejected from the vehicle on impact,” Tewari said. “Seat belts in front as well as rear are not mere accessories. They save lives when used properly.”
Officials at the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) agreed that it is a good move to ensure road safety, but questioned enforcement of the motor vehicle rules.
“It is okay that the government is planning this, though we will have to look at the finer details once the government announces it. But where is the enforcement? Automobile manufacturers would comply if such a notification comes out, but how many rear passengers are even challaned for not wearing seatbelts inside the car. Last month, the government came out with a notification proposing to make six airbags mandatory in all passenger cars. Globally nowhere such a mandate exists,” said a senior member of SIAM requesting anonymity.

https://mb.com.ph/2022/02/19/iata-travel-momentum-builds-as-restrictions-ease/,"66973
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) this week released data showing growing momentum in the recovery of air travel as restrictions are lifted.
First of all, international tickets sold in recent weeks (in proportion to 2019 sales) rose 11 percent.
The numbers reflect a spate of relaxations announced around the world, including the Philippines, Australia, France, the , the UK, Switzerland, and Sweden.
In the period around February 8 (7 day moving average) the number of tickets sold stood at 49 percent of the same period in 2019.
In the period around January 25 (7 day moving average) the number of tickets sold stood at 38 percent of the same period in 2019.
The 11-percentage point improvement between the January and February periods is the fastest such increase for any two-week period since the crisis began.
The jump in ticket sales comes as more governments announce a relaxation of COVID-19 border restrictions.
An IATA survey of travel restrictions for the world’s top 50 air travel markets (comprising 92 percent of global demand in 2019 as measured by revenue passenger kilometers) revealed the growing access available to vaccinated travelers.
A total of 18 markets (comprising about 20 percent of 2019 demand) are open to vaccinated travelers without quarantine or pre-departure testing requirements.
Some 28 markets are open to vaccinated travelers without quarantine requirements (including the 18 markets noted above). This comprises about 50 percent of 2019 demand.
Also, 37 markets (comprising about 60 percent of 2019 demand) are open to vaccinated travelers under varying conditions (18 having no restrictions, others requiring testing or quarantine or both).
“Momentum toward normalizing traffic is growing. Vaccinated travelers have the potential to travel much more extensively with fewer hassles than even a few weeks ago,” says IATA’s Director General Willie Walsh.
“This is giving growing numbers of travelers the confidence to buy tickets. And that is good news,” he stressed.
“Now we need to accelerate the removal of travel restrictions. While recent progress is impressive, the world remains far from 2019 levels of connectivity. Thirteen of the top 50 travel markets still do not provide easy access to all vaccinated travelers. That includes major economies like China, Japan, Russia, Indonesia, and Italy.”
IATA continues to call for removing all travel barriers (including quarantine and testing) for those fully vaccinated with a WHO-approved vaccine.
The association bats for enabling quarantine-free travel for non-vaccinated travelers with a negative pre-departure antigen test result.
IATA advocates for removing travel bans, and sccelerating the easing of travel restrictions in recognition that travelers pose no greater risk for COVID-19 spread than already exists in the general population.
“Travel restrictions have had a severe impact on people and on economies. They have not, however, stopped the spread of the virus,” Walsh argued.
Governments must stop singling out the traveling population for special measures, he underscored.
“In nearly all cases, travelers don’t bring any more risk to a market than is already there. Many governments have recognized this already and removed restrictions. Many more need to follow,” Walsh concluded.",IATA: Travel momentum builds as restrictions ease

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/3/18/in-australia-russians-and-ukrainians-unite-against-putins-war,"In cities across Australia, protesters have rallied against the war in Ukraine.
“[Ukraine] is our country,” says Anton Bogdanovych, his voice deep, his words measured. “It’s a country we love and we have nowhere to go.”
The senior lecturer from Sydney is among some 38,000 people of Ukrainian descent living in Australia.
Ukrainians began coming to the country in significant numbers after World War II, then when Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, migration began again.
Over the years, they have built a strong community within Australian society, with close ties to family and friends back home.
Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month, members of this community – as well as some members of Australia’s Russian community – have been doing what they can to oppose the war from afar.
Each day, Anton brings together a growing crowd of protesters to rally against the conflict in Sydney’s Central Business District (CBD). Meanwhile other protests are taking place all over the country, some led by Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin’s invasion.
Al Jazeera spoke to six protesters about their experiences of the war; about their families back home; their fears for both countries; and their messages to the world.
Anton: ‘Our parents are terrorised, our cities destroyed’
On the first day of the war, Anton Bogdanovych held a rally in Sydney. Every day since he has held one in the same city centre location and every day the number of people attending has grown. There are now more than 100 on weekdays and thousands on weekends.
The protests are for networking, for “organising, deciding what to do, allocating people to different directions,” but also for lifting one another’s spirits, Anton says.
“It’s just very difficult psychologically for people to … wake up every morning checking whether their parents are alive or not … you don’t want to call them and wake them up, so you send a message hoping for the best and it can take a long time until they reply.
“For some cities where there is no electricity any more, or internet connection, it’s even worse.”
Anton’s entire family is still in Ukraine, and most of them cannot evacuate.
“My grandma is 94, she has dementia, she has a broken leg, she can’t be transported. So my mum decided to stay at home with her. She is in Kyiv,” he explains.
“My mum needs hip replacement surgery. So her leg really hurts. And of course, no surgeries are possible right now.”
Many people in Ukraine are chronically sleep-deprived now, Anton says. His family can only sleep a few hours every night because of the bombing.
“Sleep deprivation is a form of torture … It affects their health. My father had a heart attack because of COVID, and his heart is not fully recovered. So being sleep deprived, and there are all these loud bangs all the time, I’m quite worried for his heart.”
He is also afraid for the future of the country.
“We fought really hard with Ukrainian lives for our freedom…” he says. “We see what Russians have. Where they are afraid to go on the streets even though they think that this war is unjustified. We don’t want to live in a country like that.”
Helpless as missiles “fly on the heads of our parents, and our loved ones”, Anton and the Sydney protesters are asking for a no-fly-zone above Ukraine, enforced by the rest of the world.
“Our parents are terrorised. Our cities are destroyed. For this to stop, we need help with closing down the sky so that the bombs are not dropping and missiles are not destroying our cities.”
Marta: ‘There’s no regard for ordinary civilians’
The last time Marta Semkiw heard from her family in Ukraine, the bombings were just 100km (62 miles) from their home.
Now almost 79, Marta left western Ukraine when she was six months old and her parents fled the communist regime after World War II. She was raised in Australia, witnessing the Soviet era from afar.
“My parents were political activists and [under] every occupational force that occupied Ukraine, in between the First World War and the Second World War, and afterwards, they were imprisoned,” she says.
“Between the First World War and the Second World War, western Ukraine belonged to Poland [and my parents] were both in a Polish prison. Then when the war broke out, we had the first invasion of Russians, and of course [my parents] were imprisoned [again].
“Somebody pointed a finger at [my father] and said ‘yes, he was in [prison] before’, so my father says somebody led them to my house and he was imprisoned by the Russians.
“My mother, because her mother was a widow, she wasn’t in prison. She had to go and report [to the authorities] every day.”
Marta did not have contact with her family back in Ukraine at all growing up.
“My dad deliberately severed contact because he [couldn’t] help them, or might harm them because he’s an ex-political activist,” she explains.
“When we finally met, they [said it’s] just as well you didn’t write … because your brother had to report every day and they kept asking ‘where’s your younger brother?’… And of course, he had no idea where [we were]. His wife just had this intuition that we were alive somewhere.
“It took 50 years before we found each other.”
Marta says Putin’s war reminds her a lot of what her parents told her about previous occupations of Ukraine: “About the oppression, about the cruelty, about the loss of freedom, [being] unable to speak what you wanted to speak.”
“Now you’ve got that plus all the new weapons that people are using, and I mean, there’s no such thing as any regard for ordinary civilians, they are bombed daily.
“It’s breaking up families,” Marta says. “They don’t know whether they’ll see each other again, you’ve got fathers saying goodbye to their wives and children, and going back to the front.
“[I feel] stressed, worried, powerless … emotional, but I ring my cousin every day to try and bolster her … when she gets down in the dumps I say something positive.”
Iryna: ‘It’s hell in Kyiv’
Iryna Semenova is desperately worried for her parents. Born and raised in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, she moved to Australia three years ago with her partner for work after spending time in Germany and Canada.
At Anton’s protest in Sydney, she stands holding a sign reading “I want to see my mom and dad again”.
Iryna’s parents were in Kyiv when the war began.
“I see a lot of people telling me, why didn’t you get them out of [the] country before?
“It wasn’t that easy. No one wanted to believe that [the war was] going to happen and my parents especially – for the first days of war, they were just hoping that [everything] will go away.”
But recently both Iryna’s and her partner’s parents have left the city. “We were monitoring what’s going on for them, helping other people on the road – that’s another example [of] how people are united,” she says.
“[My parents] are not in a safe place still, but at least it’s quieter because Kyiv … it’s just hell in there.”
Iryna was also able to leave her savings with her parents so that they at least have some money. But a bigger problem now is getting food and medicine, she says.
“My dad has issues with diabetes … I’m really worried for [my parents] to find enough petrol to drive, to find medicine, to survive, to find food and water.
“They left their homes and everything that they had in there. They just [took] some warm clothes and money and the food that they had left, and that’s what everyone is doing now. Hoping and praying that they will be able to get back to their home once again, that they … will survive.”
Another worry, she says, is that her dad will not be able to leave Ukraine – “every father … almost every grandfather” has to stay behind to fight. “He [is so sick] … I really hate to think that he and my mum will be separated.”
Iryna’s hope is that the Russian military will stop the invasion. “Russian mother just stop allowing your kids to come there, military workers you will die there, this is bad for you too,” she says.
For Iryna, the only way out of the war would be for the Russian people to stand up to Putin.
It was painful, she says, “to see when [Russian] people understand what’s going on, but they still say ‘there is nothing I can do, it’s the government, why do you bully us?’”
“We [Ukrainians] don’t try to bully you. We try to beg you for help.
“We are not against you, of course, we are very angry and hurt … But we understand that we are in this together. This is war. This is not some small conflict. Both sides are affected.”
Petr: ‘Russians should protest in bigger numbers’
In Australia, there are also Russians making a stand against Putin’s war.
Petr Kuzmin is a Russian-Australian startup founder living in Melbourne and president of the Victoria branch of the pro-democracy movement the Svoboda Alliance.
Anton knew about Petr from afar – after Petr spoke in front of the crowd at two Ukrainian rallies in Melbourne and news of his anti-war stance spread to Sydney.
So early on in the invasion, Anton called him, asking Petr to organise protests for Russians who opposed the conflict.
Petr’s immediate reaction to Russia invading Ukraine was “visceral”.
“It’s like attacking your own brother … I felt really angry, and really pained and outraged,” he says.
He was driven to act, to do what he could “to stop the war right now. So that innocent people will stop dying, soldiers [will] stop dying”.
So he agreed to organise the Russian protests and set up the first one on March 2, the 7th day of the war.
“I was not fully confident that it would work,” he says, “but I just went ahead and set up an invite on short notice – it was only two days out – and over 50 people showed up.”
Since then, members of Melbourne’s Russian community have gathered on Princes Bridge in the centre of the city every evening, with banners to show their support for the country Putin is attacking.
But as the days pass, Petr has begun to worry for Russia too.
“I am a patriotic Russian and I find it impossible to simply cheer for the destruction of Russia in this war,” he says.
“I don’t think this is really a good outcome for the world, either. If Putin’s regime collapses in a very ugly way, and there’s lots of violence, and there’s lots of unrest … who needs a failed state one-sixth [of] the size of the world, nobody needs that.
“The sanctions are very, very rapidly destroying the banking system, the economy, and just the lives of ordinary people,” he says.
Russians around the world should be protesting “in bigger and bigger numbers” because those within Russia are not able to do so safely, he says, adding that many of his friends inside Russia are worried that if they protest, it will affect their families.
If the diaspora protests, it “will indicate to the Western world … that Russians are actually against the war, that will help fight the propaganda that the Kremlin is spewing, it will also help the Western political leaders differentiate between the regime, Putin’s regime, and ordinary people”.
“I believe there have to be two different strategies: one for the regime, and [that] has to be very punitive, and very harsh, and one for the ordinary people … people who are suffering,” he says.
The effect of the sanctions is being felt beyond Russia’s borders as well, Petr adds. One young woman who attends his protests left Russia for Australia just more than a week ago.
“Before she came to Australia, she was protesting in Moscow and she was being chased down by police … She managed to escape, she got here, and now her credit cards are not working. So she is stuck here. She doesn’t have money … She’s kind of at the mercy … of people who will help her.”
Ilya: ‘Russia cannot put the whole nation in jail’
Ilya Fomin is another Russian living in Australia. He regularly attends Anton’s anti-war rallies with a Russian flag that reads: “I am Russian, and I #StandWithUkraine.”
But he opposed his government well before this latest conflict.
“I got interested in politics … when I was 18 years old,” he says.
When, in 2011, then-President Dmitry Medvedev declared Putin his successor, Ilya was outraged. “This was the moment when I understood that no … in a democratic country there cannot be any successor of [a] president.
“We started going [out to protest] every day, every night,” says Ilya.
“We were not … radicals who want[ed] just to make a riot … we want[ed] to insist on our right for a peaceful protest.”
But Ilya was arrested for protesting.
Putin was elected in March 2012 and the rallies ended with violent crackdowns. The following year, Ilya applied for a new passport.
“That was the moment when I got a pretty bad conversation with Secret Service,” he says. “They said that either you go to jail or you basically stay silent.
“I realised there is still no ‘critical mass’ to start a large democratic shift in the society and I thought I can be more useful from abroad.”
Now, Ilya is based in Australia. But back home, his friends in Russia are protesting again, this time against Putin’s attack on Ukraine. He says some of them have been arrested and spent several days in jail.
“[But] they cannot put the whole nation in a jail … so in that sense … if people would just keep going out … of course, they can just reach the moment when the state cannot actually resist.”
Ilya is part of the same organisation as Petr, the Svoboda Alliance.
“We really want Russia to stop the war, we really want foreign governments to freeze and seize [the] assets of Putin, [and the] allies of Putin,” he says. He adds that he would like this money to be given to Ukraine so it can be used to rebuild the country.
Meanwhile, living in Australia is becoming ever more difficult for Russians who, he says, are facing xenophobia because of the actions of their government.
“Just yesterday, there was a guy who attended our rally in front of the consulate … to demand the stop of the war. [He told me] he was refused to get a coffee from [a] café because of his Russian accent.”
Kateryna: ‘I am so scared’
Kateryna Argyrou is co-chair of the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, a body for 22 community organisations across Australia. She has been “approaching the Australian government, asking them for help and aid”.
“The Australian government has been fantastic in responding quickly and acting quickly,” she says.
Kateryna was born in a town of 9,000 people just outside Lviv, close to the Polish border. She studied abroad, met her Australian husband in London and moved to Australia 10 years ago.
“I have a little girl now, a two-year-old,” she says.
Kateryna is the only one in her family to have left Ukraine. Her relatives live in Kyiv and Lviv.
“I don’t know if I’m going to see my mum or dad again. I don’t know if I’m going to see my sisters. I have a little girl that hasn’t seen any of my family members … a little girl that hasn’t met her grandfather.
“The day that bombs started hitting Ukraine, it was 5am in Ukraine,” she recounts, adding that it was afternoon in Sydney, where she was working from home.
“I tried to get in touch with my parents. My mom was obviously still asleep. I couldn’t get a hold of her. And I just feared the worst.
“Every single day since then, I try to call my relatives and all my family members every hour on the hour, trying to see if they’re OK, do they have everything that they need, and every time that someone doesn’t pick up the phone … I fear … that they might be dead.”
Kateryna says her grandparents live in a residential tower in Kyiv and have been “going up and down” between the basement and their flat with every air raid warning. “It’s an old building. There are leaky pipes, there’s no lighting there. There’s no running water.”
In Ukraine, the tap water is not safe to drink and people usually buy it in bottles, she says. “[Now] they can either get water and boil it but again, you need access to electricity … otherwise they have to go without water.
“Most of the shops are closed because they’ve run out of food. They’ve run out of water. And logistically, it’s very difficult to replenish that because the entire city is being bombed.”
She says many of her cousins and uncles are taking up arms “to protect their families, to fight for their freedom, fight for their land”.
“These are people that have never held a gun or even seen a gun in their life.
“It’s very difficult for them morally and psychologically because they know that … there might come a moment where they have to kill someone.”
Kateryna says she is trying to send money home to whoever needs it and is supporting people with visa applications. She plays a key role in the Sydney rallies, doing her best to “instil some sort of hope and positivity in the people that are here”.
“On the one hand, I’m trying to remain positive and motivated and keep my spirits up,” she says. “But on the other hand, I am so scared. I’m worried about every single one of my family members.”
Like others in her community, she is doing everything she can. But as Russia’s war has intensified, for many in the diaspora, words and protests are their only weapons.","In Australia, Russians and Ukrainians unite against Putin’s war"

🗞️ Subscribe Now: Get Express Premium to access the best Election reporting and analysis 🗞️
The decision has been taken by Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha keeping in view the decline in number of Covid-19 cases in the states of Punjab, Haryana and the Union Territory of Chandigarh.
The High Court in March 2020 had adopted the virtual mode for hearings and put restrictions on physical functioning of courts amid apprehensions of a surge in Covid-19 cases. The restrictions were eased in February 2021 with limited physical hearings allowed. It, however, returned to restrictive functioning in mid April after a number of judges, lawyers and the high court staff got infected by Covid-19 during the second wave.
As per the fresh order, requests for video conferencing will not be entertained. The ‘online mentioning’ portal will be deactivated and mentioning of cases will only be made through physical mode in the same manner as in the pre-Covid period.
“No litigant, represented by any advocate, would be permitted entry unless there is specific direction by the court.
The Advocate Generals of Punjab and Haryana and standing counsel of UT Chandigarh and Union of India are requested to issue instructions to the concerned authorities…to take instructions from police officials…as is being done during the virtual hearing and their physical presence…be avoided,” read the order.

The order mentions that entry and exit for advocates and clerks will be permitted from Gate No. 1, 2 and 5. The e-pass portal will be deactivated.
“The advocates shall ensure that clerk accompanying them should remain in the court areas for limited purpose like delivering heavy and bulky case files upto the respective court room. Such clerk shall leave the court room immediately thereafter and shall enter again only to re-collect the same. The advocates are requested to allow their clerks to accompany them only in case the file record is bulky. Advocates will ensure that they enter the court premises only for arguing cases and shall leave the premises as soon as the hearing for the day is over. The Bar Association is expected to extend its full support and ensure no crowding in corridors, court rooms etc…The president, High Court Bar Association is requested to sensitize the members of the Bar to follow the Covid protocol in letter and spirit.

https://dailytimes.com.pk/914963/interim-pms-appointment-against-constitution-shahbaz-tells-alvi/,"PML-N President and Opposition Leader Shehbaz Sharif Wednesday conveyed to President Arif Alvi that the opposition did not agree with the suggestion of appointing Justice (retd) Gulzar Ahmed as the interim prime minister and that the process for appointment issued by him was a ‘violation of law and the Constitution’.
In a letter, Shahbaz confirmed to the president that he had received his April 4 message about the appointment of a caretaker prime minister.
He informed President Alvi that the speaker’s ruling on April 3 on the no-confidence motion against PM Imran Khan was a “blatant violation of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan” and the “Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business” of the lower house.
“The entire super-structure built thereon, including all consequential notifications relating to dismissal of the Resolution, advice of the Prime Minister regarding dissolution of the National Assembly, and continuation of the Prime minister in office are all illegal, without lawful authority and of no legal effect,” wrote Shahbaz.
The former opposition leader also informed President Alvi that the Supreme Court was holding suo motu hearings on the National Assembly deputy speaker’s ruling.
He also shared the apex court’s ruling, stating that “any order passed by the prime minister and the president shall be subject to the order of the court”.
“Thus the process of appointment of caretaker Prime Minister started by you under Article 224(1A) of constitution in a hurried manner is simply to defeat the process of law and constitution without waiting for decision in suo motu case and petitions filed by combined opposition parties and other petitions challenging rejection of no-confidence resolution against prime minister and prorogation of requisitioned session of National Assembly by deputy speaker and consequent dissolution of National Assembly by prime minister, which are still pending adjudication before Supreme Court. Thus the start of the said process by you is not acceptable as it is violation of the law and Constitution and is sub judice,” said Shahbaz.
Shehbaz also said that Justice (retd) Gulzar Ahmed’s nomination as interim premier by PM Imran Khan was a “blatant attempt to subvert the provisions of the Constitution and to pre-empt the decision of the Supreme Court”.
He added that all issues, including the violation of Article 244 and 224A at this point, are “sub judice” and informed the president that the Opposition does not agree with the suggestion of appointing Justice (retd) Gulzar Ahmed as the caretaker prime minister.","Interim PM’s appointment against constitution, Shahbaz tells Alvi"

https://thesun.my/home-news/may-11-case-management-of-appeal-by-women-in-basikal-lajak-case-BJ9128366,"KUALA LUMPUR: The Court of Appeal in Putrajaya has set May 11 for case management of an appeal by the female clerk who was sentenced to six yearsâ jail and RM6,000 fine for reckless driving which resulted in the death of eight teenagers on modified bicycles, commonly known as âbasikal lajakâ, five years ago.
Lawyer Muhammad Faizal Mokhtar , representing Sam Ke Ting(pix), 27, who is the appellant, informed the date when contacted today.
A check of the court system, found that the case management would be held before the Court of Appeal Deputy Registrar Mohd Khairi Haron via video conference (Zoom).
Last April 18, allowed Samâs application to stay the execution of the jail sentence and fine imposed by the High Court last April 13 and also released her on bail of RM10,000 with one surety pending the hearing of her appeal.
High Court Judge Datuk Abu Bakar Katar, who meted out the jail sentence and fine on Sam, also ordered the woman to be jailed for six months if she failed to pay the fine and a three-year driving ban upon completion of her prison term.
The court handed down the decision after allowing the prosecutionâs appeal to set aside the Magistrateâs Courtâs decision on Oct 10 last year, which acquitted and discharged the woman.
Sam, who was 22 years-old at the time of the incident, was charged with committing the offence at Jalan Lingkaran Dalam, Johor Bahru, Johor at 3.20 am on Feb 18, 2017.

Dear Editor,
I have watched, listened and read the varied views about Portmore becoming a parish.
Majority of the views speak to the various amenities a parish should have to be so named.
The law, at present, says the compulsory requirement is a parish court.
So, while I agree that a market and hospital are needed, those can come after.
For those insisting on these, please tell me how many of the other 14 parishes had tax office, court, market, and hospital when they were named 155 years ago by the British.
Another thing of contention is the area to be designated the Portmore capital. Then I ask: What is capital of Kingston?
There is just too much emotion from those, mainly in Opposition, who are not supporting the move because it's not their idea.
Also, those who live in other sections of St Catherine, who are jealous about growth of Portmore, can stay out of the debate.
Go full speed ahead, Prime Minister, with the parish declaration. Those who fail to get on board with this can hop on at the next station.

https://dailytimes.com.pk/928916/over-400000-ignored-children-on-autism-spectrum-look-for-a-saviour/,"ISLAMABAD: April is the month of autism awareness and though the condition has existed for years, many people are still unaware of it, particularly in developing countries like Pakistan. According to the Autism Society of Pakistan (ASP), there are over 400,000 children on the autism spectrum, much more than the figure denotes, not counting the adults who may have it.
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurological condition that affects a person’s interaction with the world. An umbrella term encompassing four types; reflects the developmental difficulties these people face.
Governments of various nations have taken various initiatives to facilitate the autism community. While the rest of the UK is gradually adopting the laws made for autistic individuals, the British government introduced the Autism Act in 2009 to help people on the autism spectrum integrate into the workplace and society. It has been coordinating with the National Autistic Society, UK’s most significant charitable organisation, to make this process smoother and better.
The act is updated frequently to improve the quality of facilities provided to these persons. NAS, on its own, not only offers diagnostic services and treatments to the children on ASD but also to the autistic adults. It also confers residential accommodation, workplace integration, skill development and others.
Pakistan, on the contrary, is under dark clouds of ignorance marked by the lack of awareness regarding this condition the society has.
To tackle these unfavourable circumstances, many local families founded their institutes to lend a hand to this overlooked community. Autism Resource Centre Rawalpindi (ARCRWP), Zam Zam Autism Centre and Autism Point are a few examples of this.
According to ASP, the resources available nationwide to autistic people are unsatisfactory.
Co-Founder ARCRWP Ghazal Nadeem told APP, “There is a lack of specialists and institutes working for this purpose in Pakistan”.
“No bill has been passed to cater to the needs of these innocent kids and their families. We all [the families] are supporting each other with no support [from the concerned quarters]”, she added.
It is pertinent to mention that article 25 of the constitution grants equal status to these individuals with others. They are also entitled to free compulsory education like their neurotypical counterparts, referring to Article 25A.
But what about the right to work? If we shift our focus to Article 18 of our constitution, we learn that this right also has been granted, allowing them to participate in any legal trade they may choose to.
On a similar note, articles 24 and 27 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and UN SDG 4.5 and 8.5 bind the nation-states to give these same rights.
Although there are other prerogatives the constitution ensures, their implementation is almost negligible. There has been no provision for free compulsory education till now, even for the neurotypicals and the facilities to ensure inclusivity and equality are lagging far behind.
While these NGOs cater to the needs of children, there is no solution for adults.
Pakistan faces a myriad of issues concerning this area. There is no law to bound schools and workplaces for accessibility and inclusion. Then what is the way forward, one may wonder?
A comprehensive plan with input from the individuals on ASD and their loved ones is essential. A law that binds all academic and professional organisations to ascertain inclusivity within their premises is the much needed first step from the State, besides a massive public awareness campaign to promote understanding of this neurodiversity.
However, it doesn’t end here, to fill the gaps involving stakeholders, such as the resource centres to train therapists for effective treatment and diagnosis, is necessary. For this purpose, standardised assessments to diagnose both children and adults are the key.
Furthermore, scholarships in several fields, a welfare system for these neglected souls, and accommodation schemes for autistic adults are other interconnected strategies that can improve the quality of their lives.
In a world gripped by hate and prejudices, these warriors have been bracing the storms alone with none of us batting an eye to the damage our sheer negligence is inflicting upon them.
If not now, then when will we learn to accept our differences and support each other genuinely?","Over 400,000 ignored children on autism spectrum look for a saviour"

In his address at the UN Convention to Combat Desertification 15th session of the Conference of the Parties in Cote d’Ivoire on Wednesday, he added programmes and initiatives to halt land degradation will not fructify without the means of implementation necessary to support them.
“Land plays a fundamental and cross-cutting role in achieving several of the Sustainable Development Goals [SDGs]. Meeting SDG goals can help accelerate tree cover, soil conservation, and transition towards sustainable agriculture production,” he said. He added land restoration can help adapt to the climate crisis. “Land restoration is one of the proven strategies that can put us on a pathway to green recovery. It can create jobs, uplift rural communities, and deliver significant co-benefits for human health, biodiversity, and adaptation to climate change.”
Yadav stressed the need to move away from a high-consumption lifestyle. “[...] our recovery process needs to awaken change at the individual level by changing our consumption habits, without which we will continue to put tremendous pressures on land. The three conventions on climate change, biodiversity, and combating desertification are all linked by the high consumption lifestyle of a global minority among countries. And urgently reducing their profligate emissions is key to the success of all these three conventions.”
In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the goal of restoring 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030.

Company to take non-cash charge of up to $1.4 bln
May 16 (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) on Monday became one of the biggest global brands to exit Russia, laying out plans to sell all its restaurants after operating in the country for more than 30 years following the invasion of Ukraine.
The world's largest burger chain, which owns about 84% of its nearly 850 restaurants in Russia, will take a related non-cash charge of up to $1.4 billion following its sale.
McDonald's had in March decided to close its restaurants in the country, including the iconic Pushkin Square location in central Moscow - a symbol of flourishing American capitalism in the dying embers of the Soviet Union.

The burger chain represented the thawing of Cold War tensions and became a way to sample Western food and spirit for millions of people, even though the cost of a burger was several times bigger than the daily budgets of many city dwellers.
""Some might argue that providing access to food and continuing to employ tens of thousands of ordinary citizens is surely the right thing to do,"" Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said in a letter to employees. ""But it is impossible to ignore the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine.""
Though a vast majority of the stores in Russia are closed, a few franchised stores have stayed open, cashing in on the sky-rocketing popularity of McDonald's.
Over the weekend, long queues were seen at the restaurant in Moscow's Leningradsky Station, one of the capital's only branches that was open, social media footage showed.
The company last year generated about 9%, or $2 billion, of its revenue from Russia and Ukraine.

RETAINS TRADEMARK
McDonald's is looking to sell its restaurants to a local buyer and would not allow the stores to use its name, logo, branding and menu, retaining its trademark in Russia.
""It (trademark) gives them the option longer term to be able to re-enter the market,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.
The company said it would ensure its 62,000 employees in Russia continue to be paid until the close of any transaction and that they have future jobs with any potential buyer.
McDonald's restaurants are expected to start reopening under a new ownership in June, a source close to the company in Russia said.
""It is a hit for McDonald's financially, but it shows that Western companies and brands are calculating that either they cannot do business in Russia or the costs, including reputational costs, are just too high,"" Paul Musgrave, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts, said.
Earlier in the day, French carmaker Renault (RENA.PA) said it would sell its majority stake in Avtovaz (AVAZI_p.MM) to a Russian science institute, as companies scramble to comply with sanctions and deal with threats from the Kremlin that foreign-owned assets may be seized. read more
Analysts expect more major brands to follow McDonald's. Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) have already paused operations in Russia.
""I would not be surprised to see other companies follow McDonald's lead of exiting the market,"" Edward Jones' Yarbrough said.

https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/national/act-wazalendo-advises-govt-to-reduce-commercial-borrowing-3851468,"Dar es Salaam. Reducing commercial borrowing, revival of the cashew nut development fund and withdrawing of mobile transactions levy are some of the recommendations from ACT Wazalendo party which yesterday released its analysis of the national budget for 2022/23.ACT Wazalendo’s finance sector spokespman Emanuel Mvula urged the State to lower the commercial borrowing as part of measures to contain the spiraling national debt.“Commercial loans account for 32.8 percent of the total external debt. We want the government to reduce the ratio of commercial loans to national debt to 20 percent. The government should also consider swapping these loans into concessional,” he said.According to Finance and Planning minister Mwigulu Nchemba, who presented the budget in Parliament on Tuesday, the government debt was Sh69.44 trillion as of April this year, equivalent to an increase of 14.4 percent.Mr Mvula urged the government to reinstate 100 percent of the cashew export levy to farmers as it was before the government changed the law in 2018.“The government has proposed 50 percent of the export levy to go to the central government consolidated fund and another 50 percent to fund inputs for farmers. But we strongly oppose this proposal because it will not help the farmers,” he said.

Mr Mvula also advised the government to remove the mobile money transaction levies that were introduced last year, citing the taxation measure as a burden to the ordinary citizens and the fact that it did not meet the expectations of the government.“ACT Wazalendo wants the government to abolish these levies on mobile money transactions. The government has collected Sh261 billion out of the Sh1 trillion intended from mobile money transactions and this is equivalent to only 25 percent of the targets,” he said.Mr Mvula also lamented over low budget allocated for development expenditure, which also “concentrated on facilitating things rather than people’s development.”“The level of development budget that is going to serve the people is just Sh6.2 trillion which is equivalent to 14.9 percent of the total budget. So, our budget is still very much focused on things and paying off debts rather than stimulating citizen’s development,” he said.Party leader Zitto Kabwe noted the need for the Finance and Planning minister to explain about the controversy of tax planned to be imposed on every citizen above 18 years.",ACT Wazalendo advises govt to reduce commercial borrowing

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sp-govt-set-to-make-639-staffers-permanent,"DHANGADI, AUGUST 30
Sudurpaschim provincial government has forwarded the process of making 639 temporary employees permanent.
The government is preparing to pass the Bill on Civil Servants' Formation, Operation and Conditions from the Provincial Assembly. This has paved the way for making the temporary civil servants permanent automatically. If the bill is passed from the PA, as per the government's proposal, 639 temporary civil servants will become permanent automatically.
Nepal Civil Servants Union Kailali Chairman Khemraj Joshi flayed the province government's bill. ""The federal government has embraced the policy of hiring office assistants and drivers on contract. So, it is wrong of the province government to make temporary staffers permanent automatically,"" he added. Joshi argued that making temporary staffers permanent was flawed and unfair.
Chief Minister Trilochan Bhatta, however, said that they had put the provisions to encourage low-level staffers. ""As soon as the new secretary comes, he/she changes staffers, who have worked for a long time. Thus, we are incorporating the provision to make staffers permanent,"" Bhatta added. Article 143 of the constitution states that the province government has to consult with the Public Service Commission to appoint civil servants on permanent basis.
Citing lack of manpower, the province government has appointed 639 temporary civil servants.

Dear Editor,
I saw clippings of two recent utterances from Prime Minister Andrew Holness that have prompted my writing.
Firstly, I saw on Facebook a video of Holness riding a bicycle on a night tour around Kingston. The video also shows his security contingency behind him in Land Rovers as part of his motorcade. The most eloquent PM is then seen encouraging us to do the same and see the city via bicycle.
Holness does not, however, make clear if he will make his security detail available to us to safeguard us as they ensured his safety.
Next up, I heard the PM speaking about his intent the get the guns. Instead of speaking — as he is so good at doing — why not just get on and do it? How many times has he said he will go after the gangs, get tougher on crime, yet nothing changes.
PM Holness is a clear subscriber to the Jamaican adage ""Mouth mek fi chat,"" and he should be increasingly mindful of those of us who voted for him expecting better but now realise that it is better to judge a man by his deeds not his words.

“It’s still a priority. We will invite the private sector again to revisit the possibility of doing a PPP [public private partnership] for NAIA,” Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista told reporters.
“Maybe, Megawide and the super consortium can participate again,” he said.
Bautista said discussions on the redevelopment of NAIA should start within the year.
“Actually, we met some of the members of the consortium. They have given us their interest to start the discussion,” he said.

The NAIA Consortium, which includes Aboitiz InfraCapital Inc., AC Infrastructure Holdings Corp., Alliance Global Group Inc., Asia’s Emerging Dragon Corp., Filinvest Development Corp. and JG Summit Holdings Inc. earlier submitted a proposal to rehabilitate NAIA for P102 billion.
Metro Pacific Investments Corp. backed out from the consortium over unresolved issues with the government.
The members of the consortium sent a letter to the National Economic and Development Authority on July 6, 2020, informing the agency that they were not confident about financing the project and pushing through with it.
Megawide Construction Corp. and partner India-based GMR Infrastructure Ltd. also submitted a proposal to rehabilitate and upgrade NAIA for $3 billion with a contract period of 18 years. Megawide-GMR is the same group that built the new Mactan terminal facility.
The NAIA project aims to alleviate the worsening air traffic congestion at the main gateway and resolve capacity constraints by reconfiguring and renovating facilities and enhancing operation and maintenance.
The rehabilitation project also aims to broaden NAIA’s role as a key economic and tourism driver for Metro Manila and the whole Philippines, deliver capital infrastructure investment to improve the airport’s efficiency and increase its capacity to meet the growing passenger demand from the Philippines and the Asia Pacific region.
It was supposed to be implemented in three phases from 2021 to 2024.
Meanwhile, Bautista and Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian agreed to restart negotiations for major transport projects.
The two officials discussed the resumption of talks for the major China-funded railway projects such as the PNR South Long Haul Project (North-South Commuter Railway), Subic-Clark Railway and Mindanao Railway (Tagum-Davao-Digos).

He adds that it does not matter whether the biological mother is alive or deceased, in the same homestead or married to the family.The custom was performed for the prince and he was “placed in the womb” of  Queen Mantfombi at age 11.Queen Mantfombi was King Misuzulu’s biological mother.The prince cited the case of King Cetshwayo, who succeeded his father, King Mpande, even though he was born out of wedlock. Prince Simakade said the same ritual was performed for King Cetshwayo.The founding affidavit explains that the ceremony is officiated by slaughtering to welcome the child, who becomes a member of the family and the offspring of the mother in whose womb the child is placed.“Pursuant to ukufakwa esiswini, for all intents and purposes under customary law, the child belongs to the house with which he or she has been affiliated and takes his or her rightful place in order of age with any other children of that house.“These children would have the same status, rights and obligations enjoyed by and imposed upon the biological children of the wife with whose house they have been affiliated,” reads the affidavit.Prince Simakade, born out of wedlock, was affiliated with the house of the late queen,, from where the heir to the throne should customarily come.He says this accords him the same rights and obligations as an oldest biological son of the Great Wife.The 52-year-old asked the court to apply these principles to determine whether the recognition of his younger brother, King Misuzulu, the first-born son of the Great Wife, as heir to the throne is in line with Zulu customary law.“I submit ... that it was not ... I am the rightful heir to the throne of the Zulu nation or kingship, through the custom of ukufakwa esiswini,” he said.He was moved away from his biological mother to the queen's palace of Kwakhangela.The slaughter took place and his  biological mother was compensated with three cattle.“I developed a maternal relationship with the late queen ... she became my mother and her biological children my siblings,” he said.To bolster his argument, the prince highlighted a quote from Queen Mantfombi's book, Inhlendla ka Zulu, that she considered him her first born.“The quote says: 'My eldest son Simakade, born out of wedlock by Duduzile Gugulethu, the daughter of his majesty the king's induna, Mr Mathenjwa.”“In these circumstances there can respectfully be no dispute about my position,” he added.The prince also noted “an act widely viewed as a sign of anointment that he was the heir” of a lucky wrist charm made of cow intestine by the late King Goodwill Zwelithini.Prince Simakade said he was also nominated as heir of Isilo in a properly constituted family meeting. He has also performed the traditional coronation of entering the kraal. However, only one king is recognised by the government and that is King Misuzulu.“I place before the court a full account of the circumstances and factors, and the customary law, in terms in which it is clear I am the only lawful Isilo and the royal family, properly constituted, has correctly identified me as such,” he concluded.TimesLIVEWould you like to comment on this article?

GWANDA Municipality has said it will prioritise those on the housing waiting list in the allocation of residential stands after Government allocated 2 000 hectares of land to the local authority.
The municipality’s waiting list, which is sitting at around 15 000 has been ballooning over the years as the local authority had run out of space to build.
This prompted the local authority to submit lay out plans to the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement requesting additional land.
In an interview, Gwanda Mayor Councillor Njabulo Siziba said the housing waiting list would be used to allocate stands, starting with those who had registered for housing first.
“The function of towns is not commercial stands alone. A lot of the land required is for residential stands. We have people on the waiting list and we will follow that list,” said Cllr Siziba.
While he could not readily say how many stands would be allocated from the 2 000 hectares, Cllr Siziba said the land had been earmarked for residential stands.
“We’re still in the process of sorting out the paperwork which makes it difficult to project when exactly people will start being allocated these stands and how many there will be. Minister (of Local Government and Public Works) July Moyo has however confirmed that there are 2 000 hectares of land for the Municipality of Gwanda that have been sourced from the Ministry of Lands,” said Cllr Siziba.
He said the land would go a long way in helping clear the municipality’s waiting.
“It will also help us to compensate people who were affected by double allocation under the Garikai/Hlalani Kuhle housing scheme.
Some stands were allocated to more than one person so we have to compensate those who were affected.”
Cllr Siziba said residents that will be displaced under the Jahunda redevelopment programme will also be allocated stands on the new land adding that the municipality would also ensure modern buildings in the new space.
“The residential area will grow more schools, clinics, police bases and council sub offices will be built,” said Clr Siziba.
He said there was a huge demand for accommodation in the mining town and the municipality was working tirelessly to meet the demand.
“Under the land we will have a certain space allocated towards buildings that meet modern standards such as high rise buildings. Gwanda is the provincial capital and we want to ensure that we uplift the face of the town even through the buildings which are erected,” said Cllr Siziba.
“We have more and more people relocating to the mining town which is increasing demand for accommodation. We also have students from Joshua Mqabuko Polytechnic who are in need of accommodation. Gwanda State University will soon be establishing a campus in the town and this will increase the demand for accommodation even more.”
Cllr Siziba said the local authority would not be allocating any new stands before they are serviced. Government has ordered local authorities to fully develop residential areas before settling people as they have a right to access all amenities. – @Yolisswa",2 000 hectares of land for Gwanda housing

During the event, the Cupertino giant also reaffirmed its plan to do away with physical SIM cards by announcing that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus sold in US markets will only support eSIM and will not have physical SIM cards.
What is eSIM?
An eSIM is basically a digital embedded, programmable and rewritable SIM. It can use a cellular plan of your network carrier without requiring the need of a physical nano-SIM.
What are the benefits of using an eSIM?
With the eSIM, one can change the network carrier, data or any service plan readily through websites. Presently, one has to visit the store (doorstep delivery is also available in some cases) to get a physical SIM card in order to change the mobile network.
The eSim allows users to have multiple SIMs. Apple allows the installation of eight or more eSIMs on an iPhone, however only two phone numbers can be used simultaneously. Presently, the smartphones give two sim card slots, so only two network carriers can be subscribed at a time.
What is the requirement to use eSIM?
Apple has supported eSIMs with physical SIMs since the launch of iPhone XS, XS Max and XR, along with cellular-enabled iPads and Apple Watches.
In India, the SIM tray will be given in iPhone 14 series smartphones along with a slot for an eSIM. These devices need an operating system not older than iOS 12.1.
To run an eSIM in the eligible devices, one also needs to subscribe to such a mobile network which supports eSIM. In India, JIO offers eSIM facility to its users.
How to set up an eSIM ?
Apple suggests the following step to install a eSIM in iPhone devices.

The deceased has been identified as Eramma Hiremath of Hotapeth village in Shahapur taluk of Yadgir district in Karnataka.
The woman died due to severe diarrhoea on Tuesday at the district hospital, making her the first casualty of the third water contamination case in north Karnataka, one of the people citied above said.
The hospitalisation cases are being reported from the area since Saturday. Apart from those hospitalised, which includes 10 children, several others are affected by the water contamination but their condition is not serious, said a district administration official who did not want to be named.
A local resident on anonymity said, “The water supplied from an old well was the reason behind the contamination”. The residents had taken the water samples and got them tested in the laboratory and the reports said the water could not be used for drinking purposes, he added.
Villagers also attributed two previous deaths to the consumption of contaminated water. Honnappa Gowda, 45, who died on October 23, and Siddamma Hiremath, 80, who died on October 24 also died after consuming contaminated water, said one of the residents pleading anonymity.
However, the health department denied the allegation and said that Honnappa Gowda died due to heart-related ailments and Siddamma Hiremath due to age-related ailments.
Shahapur Tehsildar Madhuraj said, “As per the medical report, there are other reasons also behind Gowda’s death besides the consumption of contaminated water”.
“I visited Hotapet village on Sunday and residents of the village complained that the stormwater drain water got mixed with pipeline water in some pockets due to some damaged pipes. The overhead tank in the village has also not been cleaned for several months,” he said.
Taluk health officer Ramesha Guttedara Shahapura, however, said that the samples of the well water and water overhead tank had been tested, and the results have established that they can be used for drinking purposes. “The fault is with the pipeline, which the authorities are checking. Alternative arrangements have been made for the supply of drinking water,” he claimed.
Earlier, in October second week, as many as 30 villagers were hospitalised after drinking contaminated water in Mandewal tanda in Kalaburagi district. On September 10, nearly 50 people, including children, were taken ill after they consumed water supplied through a pipeline that had corroded and developed holes through which rainwater got mixed with potable water in the district.
In June this year, five people had died due to water contamination in Raichur district. According to officials, the filtration units were not cleaned for some time and had led to water contamination.","One dead, 39 hospitalised due to contaminated water supply in Karnataka’s Yadgir"

In the four-year-long gruesome war, millions sacrificed their lives, including more than 74,000 Indian soldiers. For those who don’t know, the first Great War ended ‘at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month’, and therefore Remembrance day is celebrated every year on 11 November.
What is the history of Remembrance Day?
On 11 November 1918, at 11 am, the Armistice began, which was an agreement to end the fighting in World War I. This was a prelude to peace negotiations. In 1919 King George V inaugurated the event for the first time in commemoration of the first anniversary of the peace agreement. Responding to the suggestions of politicians, King George V urged the nation to pause in silence for two minutes, in a bid to acknowledge the war fatalities. Thereafter, the period of silence became the centerpiece of the Armistice Day events that took place annually. However, the name changed after the end of the Second World War.
Why does Poppy hold significance?
In the Commonwealth nations, poppies were widely sold before the origin of Remembrance Day. The flower is worn to show respect for all the people who sacrificed their lives while fighting in World War I, as well as the conflicts that followed the war. Poppy was one flower that grew on many of the battlefields during the war and was later adopted by American academic Moina Michael to remember the loss of life in the Great War. Poppy is also associated with the charity that was founded by the veterans of World War I, known as the Royal British Legion.
How is the day observed?
To mark the anniversary of the end of the First World War, people across the globe observe two minutes of silence at 11 AM on 11 November. It was the moment in the past when the armistice agreement was signed between the Allied Forces and Germany.

http://www.thevillager.com.na/africa/2022/africa-trades-away-raw-minerals-keeps-cattle-chickens-at-home/,"According to analysis by theTrade Law Centre (Tralac), only 9% of petroleum gas, 6% of gold, and 6% of iron ores remain in Africa where they have been mined.
However, almost all live cattle and chickens remain on the continent, the trade-based body revealed in its 9th edition of the “The African Continental Free Trade Area Trade Guide”, released last month.
The status quo is expected to be worsened if the envisioned internal beneficiation is not implemented with the Europeans lining up to benefit from Namibia’s hydrogen and ammonia production potential.
Tralac analysis shows that when it comes to energy — natural gas and oil account for 14% of intra-Africa exports.
Precious metals, mostly gold, only account for 3% of what Africa exports to each other. As for industrial metals – copper, nickeland iron ores – only 3% of what Africa mines are part of intra-Africa exports.
In 2021, according to the Tralac analysis, intra-African exports were valued at US$71 billion, which is 14% of Africa’s world exports.
Between 2020 and 2021 intra-Africa exports increased by 7% while Africa’s world exports increased by 32%.
South Africa is the main intra-Africa exporter and importer, accounting for 37% of intra-Africa exports and 14% of intra-Africa imports.
Other main intra-African exporters include Nigeria, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Morocco, Kenya, Tanzaniaand Zambia, accounting for 71% of intra-Africa exports.
Zooming in on what Africans are trading with each other, 17% of intra-Africa exports are mineral fuels, followed by exports of machinery (5%), precious stones(5%), ores (4%) and copper (4%).
Most intra-Africa imports are dominated by SADC member states, with exception of Ivory Coast, Morocco and Kenya which also feature in the top 10 intra-Africa importers, Tralac analysis stated.
The biggest portion of Africa’s world exports of cereals, soap, milling products, explosives and photographic equipment are intra-Africa exports.
Mineral such as gold is mainly exported by Tanzania, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe; almost all of which is destined for South Africa and Uganda.
Most of the petroleum gas exports are by Algeria.
As for the maize, exports are from South Africa of which 44% is destined for Kenya and Zimbabwe.
DRC and South Africa account for 93% of intra-Africa copper ores exports, and 97% of these are destined for Zambia.
Tralac analysis has indicated that agricultural products account for 19% of intra- African trade and in 2021, it was valued at over U$13 billion.
Furthermore, the continent export around U$62 billion of its agricultural produce, with South Africa being the dominant player, Tralac data shows.
Namibia accounts for 3% of the intra-Africa trade in beverages and 12% of fishery products as by the end of September 2022. Moreover, the country is quite dominant in diamonds.
The analysis also revealed that many African countries trade under the free-trade areas of their regional economic communities (RECs), with reduced or zero tariffs.
Members of fully-fledged customs unions such as SACU trade duty-free with one another.
Tariffs are therefore highest between those countries that do not already have a preferential agreement in place as they trade under the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) terms, Tralac found.
Trade facilitation within the continent is hampered by high transport costs, delays, port inefficiencies and cumbersome border procedures.These factors have been found to harm the trade of goods more than any tariffs.
Tralac pointed out that Annex 4 of the AfCFTA Protocol on Trade in Goods sets out rules that seek to address specific procedural hurdles to facilitate trade procedures.The Annex presents a significant opportunity for state parties to reap the economic benefits of improving the speed and efficiency of border procedures.
WHY DOES AFCFTA MATTER MORE NOW?
Founder and publisher of Forbes Africa, Rakesh Wahi in the latest 30 Under 30 Forbes
for Africa edition wrote that looking ahead, the realignment of power blocs will be the
outcome of self-interest that will drive every nation towards making choices that will suit
their long-term goals.
This is clearly being observed now with the West, Russia, China ontheir side, and Africa floating around like a paper and asked to choose.
Wahi wrote that “developed nations are not vested in Africa and their interest could
falter based on unpredictable external factors.”
Then the question now is: do African states/economies insulate against the
risks of being left unaided in the time of need?
Wahi said the only option for African economies is immediate diversification by
prioritising regional and continental collaboration and creating greater interdependency.
He said security in all its forms (trade, financial or safety) has to be derived from within
the continent and not from nations and allies who have continuously indicated that they
have no interest in Africa’s long-term sustainability.
The continent currently has various trading blocs,namelySouthern African Development Community (SADC), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), the East African Community (EAC), the Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD) and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).
According to Wahi, the regional blocs need to be further strengthened to enable the
implementation of the AfCFTA.
He said the continental free trade area would have not come at a better time for the
African continent and it has the stated focus since the – “AfCFTA aims at accelerating
intra-African trade and boosting Africa trading position in the global market by
strengthening the continent’s common voice and policyspace in global trade negotiations”.
“It is now time to implement various proposals and build efficiency,” Wahi wrote.
NAM TO LAUNCH ITS AFCFTA IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY THIS WEEK
Namibia signed the AfCFTA Agreement on 2 July 2018 and deposited the instruments of ratification on 1 February 2019, indicating its willingness to improve its intra-Africa trade.
According to a press release from the ministry of industrialisation and trade (MIT), governmant plans to launch the National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy and Action Plan for 2022 – 2027 this week Tuesday, 22 November 2022.
Furthermore, MIT will conduct a training workshop on the status of the AfCFTA negotiations and the Women and Youth Protocol at the Windhoek Country Club the same day.
The ministry explained that the AfCFTA is integrating gender equality into states’ trade policies through their strategies for implementation as a response to gender equality. Namibia thus recognises the importance of gender equality for the development of international trade and economic cooperation.
Article 3 emphasises the promotion of gender equality as one of the general objectives of AfCFTA, whereas Article 27 of the protocol on trade in services acknowledges the need to improve the export capacity of formal and informal service suppliers. This is in particular attention to micro, small and medium-sized operators and women and youth service suppliers.
MIT team explained that, as part of the implementation of the AfCFTA, capacity building and training of potential beneficiaries on the opportunities the agreement present are required.
Due to gender inequality in the continent, women and youth entrepreneurs are faced with the challenges of lack of access to information on opportunities in their environment and how to take advantage of them.
Additionally, women and youth are often not aware of how to champion inclusion in the negotiation and implementation of agreements such as the AfCFTA, the MIT pointed out.
It is in this context that the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) in collaboration with MIT will jointly conduct a workshop in Windhoek thisTuesday to train women and youth entrepreneurs, corporates, and current and potential exporters.
The training involves understanding the benefits of the AfCFTA and how to benefit from it; and also consultation on provisions to be included in the AfCFTA Women and Youth Protocol.
The AfCFTA agreement provides for protocols on trade in goods, trade in services, investment, intellectual property rights, and competition policy.
Specific objectives are to progressively eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and services.
Tralac is an independent not-for-profit company, founded and supported by seco (The Swiss Secretariat for Economic Affairs), the University of Stellenbosch Faculty of Law and the University of Namibia Faculty of Law.

This affected traffic along the line in the morning. The last carriage in the train was derailed,” he said.Jayasekara said that the train service had been restored by 12.30 pm.The main reason for the increasing number of accidents is the neglected state of the rail tracks, he said.“We have been warning of such accidents from last year. Most railway lines need repairs and because of the lack of manpower and material, the railway department has not been able to keep the tracks in good condition.The previous General Manager and political authorities ignored our warnings,” he said.Jayasekara said the current administration had taken steps to procure necessary materials including sleepers. However, the department will receive them in March 2023, he said.“The government is also not recruiting new personnel for the state sector.

He said this mega project has much significance to the two states.
“My focus is obviously on its successful completion. As of Nov 25 this year, its physical progress on the Sarawak side is 90.9 per cent. It is expected to be completed by 2024.
“I have in fact thought of going on a road tour of the whole stretch of the Pan Borneo Highway project to see the real situation on the ground sometime next year.
“This is compulsory for me,” he said at a media conference after having a briefing on Sarawak’s infrastructure development and programmes given by deputy Premier and Minister of Infrastructure and Ports Development Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah here yesterday.
Nanta said there are many more projects being carried out by the state JKR which he would also want to look into.
On the briefing, he said it was generally to give him and his team a picture of how to intensify the Works Ministry’s efforts in developing the state infrastructure.
“As has been announced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, my ministry together the Ministry of Rural and Regional Development under Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Zahid Hamidi and the Ministry of Plantation and Commodities under another Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof, have to work together with the Sarawak government to look at the plans and implementation of projects under the respective ministries,” he said.
Meanwhile, Uggah said Sarawak hoped to receive more allocations in the years ahead, particularly for rural roads development.
“We need to construct at least 2,000km of new roads to connect about 400 rural settlements still unconnected by road.
“As you know we are implementing the Post Covid-19 Development Strategy 2030 whose objective is to ensure Sarawak becomes a developed state by 2030. This includes linking up these settlements with roads within that period.
“We have communicated this to Nanta and the federal government. We also need assistance to repair the over 1,000km of abandoned logging and plantation roads,” he said.
Uggah said there has been no maintenance on them since the timber or plantation companies left the areas concerned.
“We also have raised some issues (with the federal government) on the implementation of the Pan Borneo Highway so that it can be completed as scheduled,” he said.
He also said they wanted the state JKR to be accorded a technical department status.
“I must congratulate Nanta and Fadillah on their respective appointments.
“Sarawak is lucky that Nanta too as he is helming a very important ministry. Though he has to take care of the whole country, I hope he pays a bit more attention to Sarawak,” he said. — Borneo Post Online",Works Minister Nanta says completion of Pan Borneo Highway one of his priorities
https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/kejriwal-not-play-muslim-card-aaley-mohd-iqbal-aap-for-delhi-dy-mayor-post-8342916/,"A day after he was selected by the AAP as its deputy mayor candidate in the MCD, three-time councillor Aaley Mohammad Iqbal told The Indian Express he might become the first Muslim to be nominated to the post in many years.
“The last person for the post from our community was in 1977. This sends out a message that AAP is a party Muslims can trust, and their rights will be protected. (CM) Arvind Kejriwal ji chose me because I am a senior councillor; this is my hat trick (election win), and that is not a mean feat. I won with the highest margin (in the MCD polls).
Calling this appeasement or tokenism is not right, it forgoes my achievement, and Kejriwal ji does not play ‘Muslim card,’” he told The Indian Express.
Aaley won from the Chandani Mahal ward with a margin of 17,134 votes, the highest in the MCD polls.
Attributing his victory to the trust of the people in his ward, he said: “I am a workaholic and I’m always available to lend ears to people’s grievances in the walled city. The population is mostly lower and middle class… Like my father, I have always been there for them.” His father is AAP MLA Shoaib Iqbal, a six-time MLA from Matia Mahal who joined the party in 2020, along with his son.
A seasoned politician, Aaley has had a long career, vacillating between different parties – he contested as an independent in 2012, aged 22; in 2017, on a Congress ticket, and in 2022, after he was fielded by AAP.
Aaley said his brief stint with Congress made him realise how powerless they were. “I knew if I had to do something, I would have to join those in power.”

On the AAP’s poor show in Northeast Delhi in the MCD polls – the first election after the 2020 riots – he said there was so much to be done in those wards where the party put up a sub-par performance. “We have to go to the ground, talk to people and analyse what went wrong. Especially in Northeast Delhi. However, AAP managed to pull wards in Chandni Chowk constituency under its sway.”
Of the 19 MCD seats in Northeast Delhi areas hit by the violence, the BJP bagged 12, the Congress two and the AAP four.
Aaley also addressed the complaints surrounding Kejriwal’s absence when other leaders were visiting riot-hit areas. “He was in the Vidhan Sabha speaking about the issue… and constantly talking to the L-G and the Delhi Police commissioner. Since the Delhi government does not have law and order under its jurisdiction, he appealed to the Ministry of Home Affairs to deploy forces,” he said.","Arvind Kejriwal does not play Muslim card: Aaley Mohd Iqbal, AAP’s pick for Delhi Deputy Mayor post"

Top five points on concluding ceremony of Bharat Jodo Yatra:
1. The Bharat Jodo Yatra will formally conclude on Monday with a function at the Jammu and Kashmir Congress headquarters in Srinagar. It will be followed by a rally led by Rahul Gandhi at the Sher-e-Kashmir Stadium - where the Congress and other like-minded parties are expected to join in.
2. The Congress has invited 21 key non-NDA parties to join the culmination of the yatra. According to a senior Congress strategist, all like-minded parties, including the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharat Rashtriya Samithi (formerly TRS) have been invited to attend the march. Meanwhile, five political parties -AIADMK, YSRCP, BJD, AIMIM, and AIUDF - have not been invited.
3. On Sunday, Rahul Gandhi was accompanied by his sister and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and other leaders of the party from Jammu and Kashmir for the flag hoisting.
4. Rahul Gandhi said it has been “one of the most beautiful and profound experiences of his life”. Addressing a press conference, Gandhi said, “I met lakhs of people, talked to them. I do not have words to make you understand. The aim of the yatra was to unite India, it was against the hate and violence being spread across the country. We have had a tremendous response. In fact, no one expected to get such a love-filled response.”

A fine of around ₹60 lahk was collectively imposed on the them.Mr. Cheema said that the special drive was conducted after he had received information surrounding the evasion of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the products being transported by some trucks and other vehicles.“Strict action has been initiated against all the tax evaders. On the other hand, vehicles transporting goods with correct bills were allowed to pass without any harassment. The drive was aimed to deter the tax evaders and to perpetuate a message from the State government to the genuine taxpayers that there would be no harassment to them at all. The taxation department has also provided a bilingual WhatsApp Chatbot-cum-helpline number 9160500033 to assist honest taxpayers,” he said.Stating that tax evasion would not be tolerated, Mr. Cheema said that the data mining wing of the department has been detecting tax evasion activities with the help of ETTSA (the department’s own Technical Service Agency) and various other platforms. The wing prepares reports based upon irregularities and discrepancies detected in the data, and these reports are being shared with officials concerned for necessary action, he added.“The taxation department has also established a new Tax Intelligence Unit (TIU) to monitor the GSTN platform for better analyses of the digital data available over it,” he said.

https://ticotimes.net/2023/01/22/a-costa-rica-expats-view-on-driving-in-costa-rica,"Are you tired of driving on smooth, well-maintained roads with clear signage and courteous drivers? Are you looking for a truly thrilling driving experience? Look no further than Costa Rica, where driving is an adventure in and of itself!
First of all, let’s talk about the roads. Potholes, gravel, and uneven pavement are just the beginning. In Costa Rica, you’ll also have to navigate around livestock, bicycles, and pedestrians on the roads, because why not? And don’t even think about using GPS, because the chances of it being accurate are about as good as winning the lottery.
But the real fun begins when you encounter other drivers. In Costa Rica, traffic laws are more like suggestions and drivers are known for their reckless and unpredictable behavior. Tailgating, sudden lane changes, and ignoring traffic signals are just part of the daily driving experience here. You’ll also have to contend with the infamous “pare y siga” or “stop and go” system, where drivers will just randomly stop in the middle of the road for no apparent reason, just for the fun of it.
And let’s not forget about the buses! These massive beasts of the road have a tendency to disregard traffic laws and take up multiple lanes, leaving you to wonder if you’ll ever see your family again.
But don’t worry, the excitement doesn’t end when you reach your destination. Finding a parking spot in Costa Rica is like playing a game of Tetris, where you have to maneuver your car into the tiniest of spaces while avoiding getting hit by other vehicles.
So if you’re looking for a truly one-of-a-kind driving experience, Costa Rica is the place for you. Buckle up and hold on tight, because it’s sure to be a wild ride!
Please note that this is a sarcastic article and it’s not meant to be taken seriously. Costa Rica has laws and regulations that apply to the traffic, and all the drivers are expected to follow them. The country also has a National Road Safety Council (CONASET) that works to improve the safety on the roads.",A Costa Rica Expat’s View on Driving in Costa Rica

https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/feb/25/anthony-albanese-is-first-australian-pm-to-attend-sydney-mardi-gras,"Amid the rainbow tulle, sequins and sparkles of Sydney’s 45th Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade emerged the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, in a simple open-necked shirt and jeans.
Albanese is the first sitting prime minister to join the parade, which celebrates and continues to push for equality for the LGBTQIA+ community.
The parade, under the theme “Gather, dream, amplify”, kicked off on Saturday with hundreds of thousands of people watching the 12,500 participants dance their way up Oxford Street.
As is tradition, the parade started with the Dykes on Bikes and Boys on Bikes, followed by the First Nations float, which featured a 20-metre rainbow serpent. Then came the 78ers – activists who were part of a protest in 1978 that started the tradition of the Mardi Gras parade.
Mardi Gras has returned to its spiritual home on Oxford Street for the first time in three years after it was moved to Sydney Cricket Ground in 2021 and 2022 due to Covid-19 restrictions.
Albanese marched alongside senior Labor figures – including the New South Wales opposition leader, Chris Minns, and the federal MP for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek – to huge cheers and claps from the crowd.
“People want to see that their government is inclusive and represents everyone, no matter who they love, no matter what their identity, no matter where they live,” he said. “We need to continue to argue for equality.”
This is a huge milestone for the LBTGQI+ community, said Micah Scott, the chief executive of Minus 18, a charity that supports queer youth.
“It sends a message to the rest of the country that our community is valid and that our community matters to the government,” said Scott. “It’s especially important for our young people watching on.”
This year’s parade was tipped to be the biggest yet, with a strong international presence thanks to Sydney being the first city in the southern hemisphere to host WorldPride.
A float representing the LGBTQIA+ community in China held posters that said “Chinese queers will not be censored.”
Tushar Kanti Baidya travelled all the way from Bangladesh, where homosexuality is criminalised, to march for the first time.
Wearing a traditional kurta and waving the Bangladeshi flag, he said being in Sydney for WorldPride had allowed him to feel pride and celebrate his identity without fear.
“I’ve never seen people be so open with their identity as they are in Sydney, everywhere you go there is a rainbow telling us we are welcome.”
Saturday’s parade was a first for many. Fifteen-year-old Thalia Wilson marched for the first time, joining the float of the youth organisation Wear it Purple.
“I’m terrified I’m going to accidentally fall over in front of everyone and get stomped on by a Doc Marten,” Wilson said with a big smile framed by eyebrows coloured green.
“I actually can’t believe I’m here, it feels like a dream … I feel very safe here.”
Thirty-two members of Tamworth Pride travelled more than 250 miles (400km) from the small city north of Sydney to ride in their first dedicated float down Oxford Street.
“This is a really big moment for our rural community,” said William Weller.
As much as the march is a celebration of queer identity, participants say it is still a protest movement.
Printed on the Minus 18 float were messages sent in by young people around the country outlining what they dream of to progress equality in Australia. “Inclusive sexual education” read one, “More access to queer history” read another.
“We’ve still got a way to go to achieve equality in this country,” said Scott.
Blair Tilbrook, who marched down Oxford Street under the banner of an organisation he started called Everyday Ability, said the group had marched to raise awareness of discrimination confronting queer people who live with a disability.
Alongside him, wearing the disability pride flag on his shirt, was Andrew Nicholson, who lives with an intellectual disability.
“It’s important to me that we’re heard because people who have disabilities need a chance to express themselves too,” he said.",Anthony Albanese becomes first Australian PM to march in Sydney Mardi Gras

On this monumental day of International Women’s Day, the African Energy Chamber (www.EnergyChamber.org) is proud to launch a new initiative that not only celebrates women in the energy sector but empowers them too – The African Women Business Energy Network.
As the energy industry expands, so is the need for more women inclusion in it. The African Women Business Energy Network (AWBEN) is a platform created to advocate for women towards career advancement in the energy industry by connecting them and women-owned businesses in the African region to highly competitive market opportunities and multinational buyers. This initiative sees the development of women in the energy industry as imperative.
According to the International Energy Agency, despite making up 39% of the global labour force, women only account for 22% of the traditional energy sector. For management levels, the numbers are even lower. Furthermore, the barriers women face in the energy sector are similar to those they face elsewhere in the economy. However, the challenges of the energy sector are more pressing since the sector is going through a process of transformation; clean energy transitions will require innovative solutions and business models to be adopted and greater participation from a diverse talent pool.
The energy industry lacks representation and AWBEN has been established to tackle these challenges. AWBEN looks to propagate the advancement of women in energy and women-owned businesses in the African continent as well as drive direct business- money into the hands of women in the region. To extend its reach and impact, AWBEN’s key initiatives include inciting collaboration among African women in the energy industry, hosting mentorship programs and empowering women to take ownership of their personal and professional development, offering coaching and sponsorship opportunities for girls in STEM, creating avenues to encourage more African women-participation and leadership roles in the energy industry and leveraging digital technology to enhance participation which coincides with this year’s International Women’s Day theme “DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality”.
“STEM is a major investment to level the playing field for women in the energy industry. The choices imposed upon girls in schools, shape their ambitions as adults. Right from the education curriculum, we need to be intentional with how girls are trained. They shouldn’t be subjected to limitations because of their gender. Be it STEM-related or otherwise, women should be given access to learn as much as their male counterparts – that way, they’ll have equal chances in their careers.” said Grace Orife, Advisory Board member of the African Energy Chamber and CEO of Adelaar Energy.
“We need to empower more African women to benefit from the oil and gas industry, whether we’re talking about opportunities for boots on the ground jobs at drill sites, professional positions, leadership roles or business opportunities for women-owned enterprises” said NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber.
The Chamber is a signatory of the Equal by 30 Campaign and is committed to gender equality initiatives and providing practical support to women to improve representation and tap into the socioeconomic benefits of the industry. Through the African Women Business Energy Network, we will continue to drive our commitment to African women in the energy industry and provide the dedicated platform to provide support.

A billboard featuring Oscar winner Kartiki Gonsalves and Guneet Monga. (Photo: Chetna Keer)
Blame it, rather credit it, on that adrenalin-high aftermath, that heady hangover called Oscar ooh-la-la.
If our boisterous bylanes are doing their bit for bilateral ties, credit it on foreign envoys’ earth-shaking events, rather leg-shaking action. Dance diplomacy.
From German Ambassador Philipp Ackermann to Korean envoy Chang Jae-bok, the world’s Who’s Who as much as many a Chinese Hu Hu have been shaking a leg or two to Naatu Naatu. What better stage for the German Embassy’s grooving ‘n’ gyrating flash mob than that teeming-screaming miniature metropolis that is Old Delhi.
If back-of-beyond bylanes are where the benchmarks for brand new ‘brand ambassadors’ of India Shining are, then look no further.
If this writerly ode too looks like an Oscar overdose, so be it. When the whole world is going ga-ga or overboard, what’s one little overdose.
While recently threading through one of Old Delhi’s commercial hubs, a curious confluence of chaos and commotion meets crazy colour, mapped by micro alleys as mini as the waistlines of a Kriti Sanon to Kiara Advani, one stumbled upon surprise. Not unexpected, but its positioning was unsuspected.
Of lehengas to ‘lajawaab ladkis’
In those bylanes where the brides of India and many a bridesmaid are made, there are wont to jut out like jostling and jarring elbows, at every nudge-choked nukkad, humungous hoardings of filmi dulhaniyas in a Dilli da lehenga.
What sparked the surprise were not the billboards, but their ‘brush’ with brand new faces. This crooked alleyway curling down the belly of Old Delhi now stood dotted, not with billboards brandishing lajawaab lehengas, but the latest ‘lajawaab ladkis’.
The Oscar Poster Girls’ day out on Purani Dilli posters.
Billboards, upon which there had hitherto preened a parade of Bollywood ‘s richie rich royalty, Kareenas to Katrinas, there were now pasted two faces that are the newest metaphor for Middle Class India.
One, a former sales girl at Fab India. The other, whose initial odd jobs entailed selling cheese to playing announcer at PVR.
Billboards, which now screamed the new reality, that the Oscar win has made Team ‘The Elephant Whisperers’ Kartiki Gonsalves and Guneet Monga to Team ‘Naatu Naatu’ the new ad copywriters’ content for India Inc, the new household names, and the new nameplates for India Shining.
The Oscar is thus not only a win for India, it is as much a milestone for Middle Class India.
A win akin to bringing home the cricket World Cup or an Olympic gold.
Sports is replete with extraordinary success stories wherein ordinary folks have scripted glory at the Olympics or other global platforms. From a North-East tea garden worker’s daughter Lovlina Borgohain to a Haryana cart-puller’s girl Rani Rampal making it to the Olympics stage.
What the Olympics badge of honour is to a Lovlina or a Mirabai Chanu, the Oscar is to Keeravani or Kartiki.
There are cinematic odes galore to such rags-to-riches narratives, to the triumph-of-the-commoner templates. Be it a ‘Chak De! India’ or a ‘Slumdog Millionaire’.
Sometimes, Art imitates Life. Sometimes, Life imitates Art. Finally, Life comes full circle, like a gold ka ‘kadaa’.
From a girl whose late father once sold his gold ‘kadaa’ to fund her first school excursion to the USA to her bringing back from America the dream golden statuette, Guneet epitomises that inspirational middle-class narrative of grit to gold.
As I ambled past those billboards of the new Poster Girls of Purani Dilli, the current czarinas of Chandini Chowk, it was with a heartwarming sentiment. With Hope rebooted, that the dreams of Middle Class India come mounted on a gilt-edged frame, and boast a new non-botoxed billboard sheen of sweat-sparkled skin.

https://thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2023/04/03/the-untold-truth-about-school/,"By Bakare Ayomide
The school has become a restriction. It is completely vicious in its ways, hiding behind a façade, perhaps a former truth of what it was. It was without a doubt that school influenced many of the world’s greatest minds and has given multiple individuals a distinctive profile in their society.
The restrictions that school has placed on the lives of students is a topic that is seldom spoken about. It is, after all, a systematic cycle that the world has created. As Aldous Huxley once wrote, “all men are snobs about something,” and among the many things man has snubbed is the restriction that schools have enforced in the lives of their students. What, then, are these restrictions? One of the many restrictions is the one on creatives. Nowadays, schools have done nothing to inspire creativity among their students. In schools, rules are created to restrict colourful minds from spreading their colours; there is no freedom to think outside the box, and before one is allowed to think outside the box, they must have followed the rules all their lives.
There is rigidity. Rules must be followed in perfect order; there is no room for innovation; there is no room to express what you have learned; rather, it must be an expression of what you must learn. It is why famous creatives such as Arthur Rimbaud denounced school and why popular artist (painter) Alexandre Cabanel (famous for his paintings of Venus and the Fallen Angel) suffered greatly while creating his art. Plagued by the rules of academicism, an art movement that required technique, craftsmanship, and a lot of training, the proportions must be detailed, and the brushstrokes must remain invisible. It is why he wrote, “…that’s my reward for all the trouble I gave myself not to submit an average piece of work…” after his painting, The Fallen Angel, was rejected by the academy.
In Nigerian schools, there is hardly any room for artistic liberty; writers are hardly given room to tell their stories; competitions only favour mathematics, science, and technology, which are already made by rules and studied by rules, to be applied by the same rules. This causes a lot of disinterest, which creates another restriction.
The restriction of interest, in schools, has caused a huge apathy in academia. Students no longer inquire about knowledge unattainable to them; there is hardly any curiosity towards why things are the way they are and how they work. One might say technology caused this, which is true because technology, itself, is imperialist; however, schools only teach students to pass their examinations. Students are taught how to be academically validated but not how to validate academia in their realities. In most Nigerian universities, for example, most of the students that graduated hardly knew much about their course of study. They only write their answers in ways that please their professors; the autonomy of power given to professors has dampened many students’ will to enjoy their course of study, and the grading system is the university’s favourite way of restricting students.
Another restriction is the restriction of practicality. In as much as subjects are taught for the growth of knowledge, this knowledge remains a vacuum if students are not taught about the realities they live in. Many undergraduates complete their Bachelor’s degree without any knowledge of the real world, and once they are put in this world, they are left unprepared. Students are continuously taught to read their books and pass their examinations. There is hardly any room to generate social skills and learn how to react to the world. One might argue that social skills are being taught in schools, but the truth is that in most Nigerian schools it is mandatory, where the students face favouritism, nepotism, and tribalism whilst trying to encourage their skills.
Furthermore, schools have encouraged the restriction of mental health. The mental health of students is in high disregard; students are expected to study, write notes, pay attention in class, get good grades, and repeat. The school does not create a space for the well-being of students and their experiences outside school. It is a known fact that school can be overwhelming; a popular case is among law students in Nigeria whose mental health has taken a serious toll on their livelihood. They are put under such enormous pressure from school and their homes that there is hardly any space for them to breathe. Locally, law students are sometimes assumed to run mad because of the amount of knowledge they must attain and retain to become competent lawyers. Anxiety and depression creep into the minds of multiple students and poison their hard work. It is why many students drop out—simply because they cannot handle the pressure. It is with this continuous trend of bad mental health that issues such as “exam fever” are common among students in Nigeria and how they still affect many students today.
The restriction towards the lower class is another hidden truth about schools. To be educated is expensive; fees must be paid, books must be bought, and other extra costs must be settled to ensure a proper learning environment. Unfortunately, there is no luxury for the lower class. The quality of education is ridiculously low, especially in Nigeria. In most public schools, the students are maltreated, and their understanding of a subject is not a priority. There is a constant struggle in the lower class to attain their dreams; some work over zealously to pay their school fees, and others decide to get student loans, which puts them in major debt that they might have to pay off for the rest of their lives.
In conclusion, schools have a rigidity that obstructs creative liberty, drains students, has no way of preparing students for the real world, and removes the lower class from the benefits schools are supposed to provide. It is a major threat to innovation and the pursuit of knowledge, which have changed the lives of men in the past. As much as schools have major importance and still contribute in some way to the environment, there must be some sort of change, a new set of curricula that applies to the world as it is today.

In their notice about the case the residents say the property should be expropriated due to its heritage and the history of the occupants “who are people of colour and primarily descendants of people who were not evicted by the execution of the Group Areas Act.”They say if the land is expropriated reasonable compensation should be paid to the registered owner of the property. They are also calling for the assistance of a “suitably qualified mediator who could expedite the resolution of disputes between the parties” and spare them the costs of protracted litigation.More on thisPensioners among those fighting eviction in Searle Street, District SixWoodstock tenants living on edge amid eviction threatsCoCT defeats Bromwell Street court order but must provide emergency housing as near as possibleThe residents are suing their landlord, Etienne du Toit, who took registration of the property in June 2022, soon after which eviction notices were hand-delivered, giving them a month to vacate, as well as the City and the provincial and national housing ministers.In a collective statement, the Searle Street residents said while they were elated that progress had been made in the national land restitution process, they felt more needed to be done.“Our families have lived in these cottages for the past three generations, since the 1920s. And we sincerely hope the cottages will be included in the second phase of areas in District Six to be declared National Heritage Sites as they form part of the remaining existing buildings of District Six.”Asked what the best outcome he and his fellow residents could hope for from the forthcoming court case, Sean Savage, one of the six applicants in the case, said: “The ideal outcome for me would be to remain in the home and community that I have known and been a part of for the past 54 years.”Previously, the Cape Argus reported that Du Toit purchased the property, which comprises six cottages for a mere R2450000 in September 2014.This issue forms a separate matter which is in court and Du Toit’s attorney said: “As a result of the matter being sub judice, our client’s instructions are not to discuss the matter with the media as he does not want to prejudice his legal rights.”[email protected]Cape Argus",District Six Searle Street tenants heading to court to ask State to expropriate their homes

FTO, while dealing a complaint of overseas Pakistani Dr. Muhammad Naveed Khan, who is working as a medical doctor in Saudi Arabia since 2010, decided that mistreating and harassing a taxpayer who is overseas Pakistani tantamount to maladministration under section 2(3) of FTO Ordinance, 2000.
Briefly, the Additional Commissioner-IR, Zone II, RTO Sargodha issued order dated 09.06.2022 with a demand of 7.5 million rupees as income tax for TY-2016 on account that Dr. Naveed is a resident Pakistani despite of the fact that he was residing in Saudi Arabia and was a non-resident. He provided the FBR department proof of him being employed in Saudi Arabia since 2010 and that he never stayed in Pakistan for a period beyond the limit that could make him a “resident” under the statute. He also provided the FBR department proofs of banking channel remittances received in TY-2016 and onwards.
The department kept sending notices of demand, repeatedly, to the family of Dr. Naveed and, on receipt of the demand notice of 7.5 million rupees, the mother of Dr. Naveed suffered cardiac arrest, eventually leading to her death. Deliberately ignoring the rules, regulations and procedure and wilful negligence on part of the concerned commissioner of FBR department tantamount to maladministration under section 2(3)(i) and 2(3)(ii) of FTO Ordinance. The FBR department also kept denying the overseas Pakistani status of Dr. Naveed and refused to accept any of his document online, without paying a heed towards the proofs provided by him. He was also asked to appear before the concerned officer in person despite the fact that he was residing in Saudi Arabia.
Hon`ble FTO Dr. Asif Mahmood Jah directed the Chief Commissioner-IR and Commissioner-IR, Sargodha to conduct a departmental review of the facts of the complaint and rectify any wrong done to the complainant, for the purpose of correction in notices plus the redressal of maladministration, which was not followed by the FBR department.
The complainant filed a `Review Petition` before the Hon`ble FTO. Keeping in view the grievous, yet, unwarranted circumstance created by FBR department, Hon`ble FTO made the concerned officers of FBR department, namely Shakeel Ahmad Shakeel (CIR-Sargodha), Azmat Hayat Ranjha (CIR-Sargodha) apologize to Dr. Naveed for harsh treatment and maladministration. On this occasion Amjad Farooq (CCIR-Sargodha), despite not being a part of the hierarchy at the time when the maladministration was being committed, also apologized to Dr. Naveed on behalf of the FBR department for all the agony and stress he went through during the scorching hot days.

https://times.mw/redefine-your-business/,"The world is now more complex than before. It will even get more complicated as time goes.
Businesses that are unable to change their models of doing things will not survive. The customer of today has more choices to choose from, more information at his or her finger tips and always wants to maximise value for money.
In such an environment, there are still some businesses that are operating on a model that is not in tandem with the market changes.
They are stuck in the successes of the past. They treat their employees as machines. The executives can hardly read the market changes and learn in order to bring up new strategies.
They are too lost in self-praise and personal achievements while they are presiding on sinking ships.
Progressive companies are changing their language, their level of cooperation and collaboration, their treatment of staff and their attitude towards customers.
Think of Cranium, one of the most successful firms in the world. Executives at Cranium do not just have titles for the sake of having them. They have titles that make sense to their colleagues.
It is reported that the business card of the chief finance officer for the company Jack Lawrence identified him as ‘Professor Profit’.
Even customers are looked upon differently and totally embraced in the philosophy of the company.
Co-inventor of the Board Game Cranium Richard Tait says “Customers aren’t just customers, they are Craniacs – game players who share the passion and values that animate the company that makes the game.”
Tait further stresses how such treatment of customers made a difference. “I get emails from customers that say ‘proud to be a Craniac’, ‘I am a Craniac’. This really is a movement.”
It is imperative that you set a narrative that resonates well with your employees, that gives them a sense of purpose, belonging and reliability.
You have to set a corporate culture that is impregnable. When people meet your employees, do your employees share a positive language about your company? For a majority of organisations, the answer is no.
Learn from Cranium. At Cranium, every employee you meet talks about CHIFF which eventually became the nucleus of the company’s strategic vocabulary.
It stands for Clever, High Quality, Innovative, Friendly and Fun. All that the acronym does is explaining the games’ personality and performance – how they should look, how they should be built and how the product brochure should read.
Some corporate executives think that enhancing a brand identity through marketing is enough to be competitive on the market. That is absolutely wrong. Levitan teaches better on this when he says: “For us, the foundation of a brand is the psychological contract – the contract between a company and its employees and between those employees and their customers.”
Levitan adds: “Great consumer companies are built on genuine passion, plus a day-to-day commitment to execution. Employees won’t feel the passion, and can’t maintain the operating discipline, unless they feel good about what the company sells and the values it stands for.”
When employees resonate with your corporate culture, the outcome is superior customer service delivery.
Commerce Bank stands as an outstanding example in this regard. Commerce Bank proudly challenges: “You call us on the phone and we need to transfer you to another department, the agent does not just hit the button. He or she keeps you on the phone, gets the right person on the line with you, says, Joanne, I have Jim on the line, and here’s what he needs help with, ‘and only then does the agent click off. We call that a ‘warm transfer’.”
Certainly, some organisations that are losing customers just because they are losing touch with employees who eventually can hardly serve a customer to their best.
The more they remain stuck in the old ways of doing things, unable to redefine their business operation model, the more they will join the list of corporate dinosaurs that long ceased existing.
The current business environment is merciless and takes no prisoners. It is unforgiving and will take you off the market if your corporate culture remains archaic and unresponsive to current and future market needs.",Redefine your business

Cummings said agriculture is the backbone of any economy. He promised that he will ensure that farmers are trained, equipped, and given the necessary finances and incentives, aimed at increasing food production and for farmers to reap the benefits of their hard work.
The CPP Standard Bearer gave the assurance when he served as Guest Speaker at the end of a two-day agriculture farmers summit held in Goghen Town, Mana Clan, Bomi County.
The farmers’ summit organized by World Foundation International, an agriculture cooperative agency, brought together 3,000 farmers and representatives from Liberia’s 15 counties, according to Ms. Precious Menkor, Program Coordinator.
She said the Goghen Farmers Summit, held from July 28-29, was the second largest gathering of farmers and representatives to discuss critical challenges and needs including training, finance, and equipment, that will accelerate farming activities and increase food production in Liberia.
The program was attended by a cross-section of citizens including chiefs, elders, youth and women groups, as well as local authorities, who expressed gratitude to the CPP Standard Bearer for his continuous assistance and always accepting their invitation to visit with them in Goghen Town.
The citizens lamented the deplorable road conditions, poor health care delivery service, and their limited self-help initiative to renovate and improve the only elementary school in Goghen Town, Mana Clan, Bomi County.
Cummings later empathized with the plight of the citizens and assured them that upon his ascendancy as President come October 10, Liberians will begin to experience systematic change in their living conditions.

One of the tools I use most frequently in my work is a spreadsheet compiled by the Pew Research Center tracking the composition of the electorate in the 2016-to-2020 federal election cycles. The document is an essential, straightforward Rosetta stone for understanding who voted in each of those years and for whom they voted. It’s just numbers that tell a story if you look at them in the right way. It’s the Matrix of American politics.
Given my enthusiasm for this document, you will understand that I was thrilled to learn last week that Pew was adding data from 2022.
The way Pew compiles its data is by conducting an expansive poll of U.S. adults and then validating their actual participation in each election. This allows Pew to present a more accurate picture of what happened in each contest.

The Washington Post’s Scott Clement walked through the core findings in Pew’s new analysis. In short, the results were driven by partisan turnout rather than persuasion, with Republicans outperforming on that metric. It’s tricky to extrapolate from this, though: Does it mean that Democrats will have a turnout problem in 2024? Or is it a good sign for Democrats that they fared decently in 2022 despite being beaten on turnout?
Let’s set this aside, though, in favor of considering a subset of Pew’s analysis: the changes in turnout and support at the demographic level over the past four cycles.
To do so, I compiled a number of graphs (from Pew’s new Matrix spreadsheet) comparing turnout percentages with vote margins. On each chart, a demographic group’s change is shown as a line moving from a dot (usually the 2016 election) to an arrow (2022). If the line moves down, that indicates that the demographic group makes up less of the electorate than it used to. If it moves up, it became a larger part of the electorate.

Similarly, if a line moves left, the vote margin among voters in that group moved more favorably to Democrats over time. If it moves right, the voters shifted to a more Republican-friendly margin.
Here, for example, are the results by gender. Each line shows four points: 2016 (the dot), 2018 and 2020 (the kinks in the line) and 2022 (the arrow). For nonpresidential years, the margins (below, ranging from a 20-point Democratic to a 20-point Republican advantage) refer to House races.
You can see a few things here. First, women have been a declining part of the electorate since 2016 (the line is moving down) and the margin among female voters has moved more in favor of Republicans (to the right) — at least after that shift to the left in 2018. Men have made up an increasing part of the electorate and have also shifted to the right, again with the 2018 exception.
If we look at the result by age, it’s a different pattern. Voters under 30 made up less of the electorate in 2022 but also voted more heavily Democratic. Voters age 65 and up made up more of the electorate, not surprising given that it was a lower-turnout election than 2020.
The Pew data also show that Asian and Hispanic voters shifted to the right in 2022 after also shifting to the right between 2018 and 2022. (Data for Asian Americans in 2016 isn’t available, so that arrow starts at 2018, indicated with an open circle.) Notice that White Americans make up a disproportionate part of the electorate, far outpacing their density in the population.
They are also the only racial group that votes more heavily Republican.
In each case, there’s an additional divide between men and women. Across racial groups, women consistently vote more heavily Democratic. White women voted more heavily Democratic in 2018 but have not since.
Those shifts among Hispanics, of course, are a central source of heartburn for Democratic candidates and party officials. The shifts to the right in 2022 were not as dramatic as those in 2020, but they were not a reversal of those 2018-to-2020 shifts, either.
Except, that is, among younger Hispanics. Hispanic Americans under the age of 50 moved left between 2020 and 2022, as did White Americans under 50. (In 2020, White Americans under 50 were evenly split in the presidential race.) Those younger White people, though, made up much less of the electorate.
In general, members of each political party voted heavily for their party’s candidates. Independents continued their rightward drift, but independents are still voting more heavily Democratic than they did in 2016.
Among Republicans, there has been an interesting shift. Since 2016, conservative Republicans have moved to the right while moderate Republicans have moved left (with a rightward jog between 2020 and 2022). But moderate Republicans also make up much less of the electorate than conservatives — and a smaller percentage of voters than they used to. The Republican portion of the electorate, in other words, is getting more conservative.
There are two other key divides in the electorate worth exploring.
The first is a partisan split between urban and rural voters. Pew’s data shows that each of those groups makes up a relatively small part of the electorate, with suburban voters making up far more of the voting pool. Those suburban voters shifted right for the first time since 2016 — probably in part a function of Donald Trump not being on the ballot. (Directly, anyway.)
The much-watched subgroup of suburban women didn’t change much from 2020 to 2022, though the margin at which they prefer Democrats has declined. Among suburban men, the margin shifted back into Republican territory in 2022.
One of the biggest political shifts was among rural women, who moved 13 points toward Republicans in their vote margin from 2020 to 2022.
That suburban-women demographic is also often conflated with married women, which is oversimplified. There is a big gap in vote margins between married and unmarried Americans, as shown below. But this — like race and education — overlaps with age.
Education, of course, is the second of the two divides worth looking at more closely. In 2022, voters with college degrees made up a larger part of the electorate than they had in 2020. But, to the Democrats’ detriment, their margins shifted right.
Here again, we see a divide by gender. Women without a college degree have both moved to the right since 2016 and made up much less of the electorate. You’ll recall that the percentage of women in the electorate fell from 2020 to 2022. That drop was entirely among women without degrees.
It was also among younger women. Women 50 and older made up a larger percentage of the electorate than they did in 2020.
If we compare education and race, we see a result that looks a lot like the overlap of race and age. This isn’t surprising; older Americans are much less likely to have a college degree than younger Americans.
Finally, it’s worth noting one remarkable shift in the Pew data: income. In 2016, those making under $50,000 a year made up almost three times as many voters as those making $100,000 or more. Now, the wealthier group makes up more of the electorate. It has also moved sharply to the right since 2020.
Remember that all of this is conflated with turnout shifts. It is not the case necessarily that these groups are turning out more heavily forever or have newly embraced Republican politics. It may be the case that more-Republican voters from those groups turned out more heavily in a Republican-favorable election cycle.
But that’s the beauty of the Pew data! There’s an enormous amount to parse and examine and mull over. You just need to follow the white rabbit.

The Oodua People’s Congress (Reformed), has urged President Bola Tinubu not to allow the military coup that recently removed a democratic government in the neighbouring Niger Republic to distract him from focusing on how to alleviate the sufferings Nigerians are currently experiencing as a result of fuel subsidy removal.
National President of the group, Chief Dare Adesope gave the admonition in Lagos on Tuesday during an empowerment programme for his members in the southwest zone and other Yoruba-speaking communities in the country.
About 40 members of the group were beneficiaries of the cash incentives given to cushion the effect of fuel subsidy removal.
Adesope said the gesture was in commemoration of his 55th birthday.
Adesope said that Nigerians are presently finding it difficult to feed themselves because of skyrocketing food prices and the absence of basic needs since the removal of fuel subsidies.
”How to ensure the situation will be reversed and the poor will also breathe should be the focus of the Federal and other tiers of government, not the issue of the Niger Republic.”
Adesope also urged President Tinubu should also ensure even distribution of palliatives to every segment of Nigeria’s populace and not only government workers.
He added: ”Every Nigerian sees him (Tinubu)as their president, and so his plans must also cover the unemployed, petty traders, and artisans, who are most affected by the economic downturn, and not only government workers and those in organised private sectors.
“I’m not talking about the N8,000 government palliative to the poorest homes because the amount cannot feed a family in the face of the current economic reality, but about how many more Nigerians can be economically empowered so as to substantially reduce the high level of poverty in the country.”
Some of the beneficiaries expressed their gratitude to Adesope and promised to use the money for the purpose for which it was given to them.",OPC to Tinubu: don't allow Niger Republic coup distract your govt

What’s your view on the ECOWAS decision to deploy military to restore democracy in Niger, considering Nigeria’s relationship with that neighbouring country?
The opinion, being sought and offered here, can only flow naturally from my widely known humble interrelated backgrounds as a Nigerian, nay African, borderlands citizen, a fronterizo of a global reputation as an extensively published Comparative Historian of African Borderlands and Regional Integration, with a unique lifelong involvement in cognate policy advocacy and widely documented impacts in Nigeria, ECOWAS and the African Union. From this confessed bias and standpoint, it has appeared that the ECOWAS decision to deploy the military machine of the regional body to undo the military coup d’etat in Niger and restore the democratic regime there, was taken in such a haste, rather at the spur-of-the-moment, that gravely overlooked the so many complications, complexities and intractable challenges in the way of any successful implementation.
Happily, there now seems to be a swing back into emphasis on diplomacy and military intervention as last resort, though earlier public pronouncement, which should never have been made, about the decision to deploy the military, has continued to trail and dominate the public debate and popular disapproval, even condemnation, in Nigeria and, indeed, other mostly Francophone African member states where, because of curtailment of freedom of expression, public opinion against this evidently unpopular decision has been driven underground.
How will you define Nigeria’s foreign policy in this regard, or with regards to prioritising military intervention in supporting hostility against neighbouring countries that we share cultural affinities?
I am not an expert in diplomacy or diplomatic studies; and I therefore have no formal qualification or competence to comment on issues of foreign policy and the like.
However, as a well exposed comparative-perspective historian of African borderlands and regional integration, I am sufficiently aware of the fact that when and where foreign policy practice relates to a territorially adjacent foreign jurisdiction at a given country’s immediate backyard, as in the case of Nigeria and Niger under discussion, there is a compelling need to blend and diversify the approach by balancing the conventional type, or what experts refer to as Track I Diplomacy, based on provisions of rules and protocols in familiar-type bilateral and multilateral agreements on the one hand with, on the other, so-called Track II Diplomacy that privileges recognitions of critical mass of vital though largely informal cross-border interactions and solidarities.
While on the one hand, that of Track I, foreign policy is aimed at conducting relations between sovereign States as external entities to one another, Track II obliges an inward vision between States across common international boundaries or borders in shared neighbourhood wherein prevails the non-conventional but yet important rule of good neighbourlines for mutual benefits.
In the Nigeria-Niger case in discussion, as indeed, between Nigeria and each of the other limitrophe proximate neighbours in ECOWAS and Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), much energy and resources have been expended over the years on exploring the numerous cross-border commonalities of environment, ethnicity and culture to define and establish vital cross-border cooperative instruments and structures to harness the diverse cross-border factors of proximity between the two countries and their interpenetrating peoples and harmonise the two otherwise asymmetrical national economies in a rapidly integrating region and continent.
The point about the ECOWAS initial prioritisation of military engagement with the military rascals in Niger is, therefore, that it, ab initio, overlooked the necessity to look inwards for support by the people and governments of the region, not least the generalities in Nigeria, whose President, Bola Tinubu, doubles as the recently elected Chair of ECOWAS’ highest policy-decision making organ, the Authority of Heads of State and Government.
The decision by ECOWAS authority that tended to prioritise the military approach to the democratic roll-back in Niger clearly placed all its emphasis on Track I at the expense of Track II Diplomacy with which it should have blended and, in fact, surpassed.
The decision was, for example, unable to foresee the widespread reservation, if not total disapproval of military intervention of ECOWAS in Niger, by the people and national legislature in Nigeria, if not in other member states of ECOWAS.
Can you expatiate more on the issue of Track II Diplomacy as it relates to the Nigeria-Niger case in our discussion?
It is trite knowledge that Nigeria and Niger share so many vital cross-border commonalities of the same environment and historic populations, ethnicity and kinships, culture of language and religion, economy of peasant agriculture and trade.
These and many more bonding commonalities have been creatively explored to achieve such African exemplar Cross-Border Cooperation instruments and structures, as, not only the historic Nigeria-Niger Joint Commission on Cooperation with an impressive Secretariat and functional bureaucracy in Niamey; there have also been Local Bilateral Committees that twin limitrophe regional and local authorities that serve to promote the bottom-up approach to African integration, such as subsequently came to be galvanised into such wider regional integration instruments as ECOWAS Cross-Border Cooperation Initiatives (CIP), of 2005 and the African Union Border Programme (AUBP), of 2007, all aimed at driving regional and continental integration into the highly preferred future of integration more of the people State than of constituent African sovereign States at the two complimentary levels.
A Nigeria-led ECOWAS war on Niger not only risks the destruction of the aforementioned vital cross-border proximity building blocks for a stronger ECOWAS of the people; war on Niger, especially led by Nigeria at this time, raises the frightful spectre of an avoidable war of colossal destruction waged by government of exactly same African people in one state on kith and kin in hitherto most peaceful limitrophe proximate neighbouring state, to the fatal detriment, not just of the two states, but also ECOWAS itself, Africa’s oldest postcolonial Regional Economic Community (REC), that both States rank together as among the foundation members.
But Nigeria was known not too long ago to have led ECOWAS Stand-by Force, ECOMOG, to militarily intervene in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Why is the similar decision to militarily intervene in Niger not enjoying popular support by Nigerians?
The times and circumstances are grossly different. Niger to Nigeria is not Liberia or Sierra Leone for reasons already stated. Besides, ECOMOG was a regional initiative led by Nigeria then under one of the most protracted, if not controversial military dictatorships.
We must not be drawn into an inherently indeterminable debate of comparing the evidently incomparable.
What then is the available option or alternative in dealing with the situation in Niger and rolling back the frightful coup waves in Africa, and especially ECOWAS?
A more preferred option and, indeed, the only reasonable approach to the challenge currently posed by the admittedly unacceptable situation of democratic disruption in Niger and the rest of West African Sahel is diplomacy unlimited, as ECOWAS is known to have adopted and continuing to sustain in Guinea, Mali and Burkina Faso. Niger must not be treated differently.
The way to a lasting roll-back of military and what some analysts have also labelled as civilian coups in Africa is good governance, characterised by the eradication of endemic corruption and attendant culture of gross inequality and abject poverty on the side of the masses and provocatively opulent lavish life style of political class, exacerbated by the insensitivity of the political class everywhere in the continent; most notoriously in Nigeria; not military intervention in the States that have gone the way of ongoing aberration of military coups.
If ECOWAS goes to war with Niger, how will it affect the border towns in Nigeria, in terms of commerce, trade and social relationship?
How else could anybody have imagined the consequences other than that of whole sale wanton destruction of all the border towns on either side of the border, just as we are now witnessing in the ongoing Russian war on Ukraine.
The huge commerce and trade across the border would definitely be adversely affected, and the socio-cultural fabrics interconnecting the two traditionally close neighbouring countries would be brutally severed.
How porous is the boundary between Nigeria and Niger and how can it be well demarcated?
The notion of ‘porous boundary’ is too value-laden, coming from a negative statist perspective of border-enforcement to be entertained here. A relatively value-free, plainer and, therefore, more scientific alternative term or concept is permeability. Borders in Africa, as elsewhere in today’s world of ubiquitous nation-state/ state-nation and characteristically arbitrarily defined boundaries are milieux where state territorial sovereignties are notoriously perforated by usual types of trans-border entities, physical and human, that camouflage boundaries, making them more predisposed as bridge than barriers between demarcated state territories on both sides.
To this extent of a reformulation of the analytical concept, Nigeria-Niger boundary is certainly as permeable as any other international boundaries, including the ideologically sealed, as between Communist and open/Capitalist states like North and South Korea. And, as regard the status of the demarcation, the Nigeria-Niger is one of few African boundaries that have been satisfactorily demarcated.
How will you advise the Nigerian government in handling the matter?

The upgradation work was suspended during Covid-19.""Nepal Telecom has been migrating its existing copper-based landline customers to FTTH without charge. New subscribers have to pay the fees,"" Adhikari said.“We have been migrating copper-based landline (PSTN) to FTTH by contacting our customers wherever we have built the network. We are shutting down our copper-based landline service in areas where we have completely upgraded to FTTH,” he said.Customers who have missed the upgrade should inform Nepal Telecom as the old technology will stop working in Chabahil, Gongabu and parts of Patan from September 18, the company said in a notice on Sunday.The Chabahil area includes Bouddha, Baneshwor, Sinamangal, Shantinagar and other neighbourhoods.There are different subscription packages of different prices, and customers can choose the one they want, Nepal Telecom said. The company has also launched offers and schemes on the packages. The existing copper-based landline technology allows customers to use voice and asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) broadband services.These services are available even when there is a power cut, but FTTH does not work when there is no electricity, and customers cannot use their landline connections to make phone calls.Frequent power outages have become a problem in recent times as the decades-old electricity infrastructure cannot handle the increased load.Nepal Telecom said that technology needs to be upgraded with time. Customers can install uninterrupted power supply to ensure that their FTTH routers and phone lines keep working in case of a power cut.""The copper-based telecom technology has become obsolete and the broadband speed of ADSL is slow compared to FTTH. That is why the technology has been upgraded,"" said Adhikari.""Customers can obtain phone, Internet and IPTV services from a single FTTH connection, depending on the type of service they require,"" he said.""When the landline connection is upgraded to FTTH, the subscriber's phone number may change by a few digits or not at all depending on the area,"" the company said. “There are other technology options for migration from copper-based landline connections, but we chose FTTH as customers can obtain different services through a single cable,” said Adhikari.According to experts, the copper wire-based technology suffers from interference from other wires. The advantage of optical fibre is that it has unlimited capacity. It also offers a higher bandwidth compared to ADSL. Nepal Telecom has contracted Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE for upgradation from copper-based landline service to FTTH. Two separate contracts—one for the supply of equipment to upgrade the technology to FTTH, and another to build the network—were signed, the company said.According to the management information system report of the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, Nepal Telecom had 547,737 fixed voice telephone subscribers as of mid-May this year.Out of the 547,737 voice telephone subscribers, 430,741 were subscribers of PSTN, 56 of very small aperture satellite (VSAT) and 116,910 of wireless local loop (WLL).Only 1.88 percent of the total population is using fixed voice telephone service as 116.02 percent of the people are using mobile service, the report shows.Nepal Telecom accounts for 59.80 percent of voice service based on SIM subscriptions and Ncell accounts for 40.19 percent of voice service users.Nepal Telecom has 236,390 ADSL subscribers and 1 million FTTH subscribers.

However, higher humidity levels limit this natural cooling mechanism. As a result, people can suffer heat stress and illness, and the consequences can even be fatal even at much lower ambient temperatures.A heat index of 41 degrees Celsius is considered dangerous to human health.CSE researchers point out that these local trends are consistent with the observations made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a global body of leading climate scientists.The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6 WG-I) report says hot extremes, including heatwaves, have intensified in urban centres that are experiencing air temperatures several degrees warmer than the surrounding areas, especially during the night.The urban heat island effect can add two degrees Celsius to local warming, reducing the adaptive capacity of cities and increasing risks, the IPCC warns.""Climate change is making the city so hot and humid that it is not cooling down adequately even during nights, adding to severe thermal discomfort. As a result, electricity demand -- driven largely by mechanical cooling (especially air-conditioners) -- is surging.""""In 2023, average daily peak electricity demand in the monsoon period was the highest since real-time load monitoring started in Delhi in 2018,"" says Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE.The report said that the ambient average temperature for the last 10 summers is marginally lower than the decadal average for 2001-10, but this does not mean Delhi is getting cooler.Changes in the pattern of rains, especially unseasonal rains in the pre-monsoon period, have led to an increase in relative humidity, which is making the city’s weather muggier and more uncomfortable even though there have been no significant changes in ambient temperatures, it said.During the pre-monsoon season in 2023, the average relative humidity stood at 49.1 per cent, which was about 21 per cent more humid than the 2001-10 average.During the monsoon season (June to September), the average relative humidity was 73.2 per cent, 14 per cent higher than the 2001-10 average, the CSE analysis reveals.Delhi’s power demand is closely linked to outdoor temperature and humidity conditions. The demand is at its minimum when the outdoor heat index is between 17.5-22.5 degrees Celsius (daily mean) during February and October.Every degree increase in the heat index leads to a 140-150 MW increase in power demand in the city, the CSE report says.It highlights that Delhi is consuming more electricity at night due to the changing nature of heat in the city.Night-time power demand has a similar but starker relationship with outdoor temperature and humidity conditions. Night-time demand increases by a staggering 190-200 MW for every degree increase in the outdoor heat index beyond 22.5 degrees Celsius, almost one-third higher than the day rate, the report said.

Addressing a joint press conference along with caretaker Minister for Primary and Secondary Healthcare Dr. Jamal Nasir here on Monday, he said sixty-eight patients have suffered the loss of vision following the administration of Avastin injection in the province. The minister said that experts from Britain and Singaporean have been requested to help investigate the matter. The health department has also sought the cooperation of the pharmaceutical company, Roche, responsible for the development of the injection. He continued that Police DIG Investigation was actively involved in the case.Dr Javed Akram said that initial findings indicate a single source of contamination; however, no bacteria were detected in the injection or any of the equipment used, including syringes and water. There was no problem with Roche’s injection and blocked batches will be released soon. The investigation suggests that infection may have arisen from improper storage practices by the company responsible for transporting the injection.
The provincial minister noted that the day this injection was transported, heavy rainfall occurred in Lahore, possibly affecting the injection sent to Bahawalpur by Daewoo Company. The initial investigation has reportedly detected the chronic problems in repackaging (compounding) the Avastin drug and its supply and the maintenance of the cold chain that led to the outbreak of the disease in Punjab.",Avastin Injection improperly used for ocular treatments: Dr. Javed

State Human Resources, Health, Indian Community Affairs, National Integration Committee chairman A Sivanesan said the statistics on individuals at risk of contracting the disease are very worrying.
He said screening should be done to identify the health status, disease, the risk of disease occurrence in addition to delaying the occurrence of complications of the disease.
âThis year we have targeted 113,000 individuals aged 18 and above in Perak to undergo NHSI screening activities since it was launched by the Ministry of Health in July last year.
âUntil October 26, a total of 98,158 individuals have been screened through the MySejahtera platform and another 20,844 through the PekaB40 platform, making the total number 119,002, exceeding the outlined target,â he said when speaking at the Perak state level World Diabetes Day Celebration 2023 at Universiti Teknologi Petronas (UTP) near here, today. -- MORE
Sivanesan said, most of them are aware and know the factors that cause diabetes, but do not consider it a serious matter and do not seek proper treatment.
âPrediabetes is a stage where a person has a screening reading range that is at risk of getting a chronic non-communicable disease if no early intervention is done.
âThose who are in the prediabetes stage do not give any symptoms to their sufferers and only the screening method is able to know that someone is in the prediabetes stage,â he added.
He said, in Malaysia, about 3.9 million people aged 18 and above or 18.3 per cent of them have diabetes and what is more worryingly is that half of that number are unaware of their disease status.
âA total of 547 million adults aged 20 to 79 years globally have diabetes in 2021 and the International Diabetes Federation expects that number to increase to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million patients by 2045.

A bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul passed the order on November 7 after a news report regarding ASI team’s visit to the site in question was brought to the Court’s notice by senior advocate ADN Rao, assisting the Court as amicus curiae in the Aravalli mining matter case.
Stay tuned with breaking news on HT Channel on Facebook. Join Now
Rao informed the Court that the news report filed in July indicated that the site in question falls in Mangar and Kot villages in Haryana’s Faridabad district. He further informed that a five-member team of ASI will carry out carbon dating of the ancient stone carvings believed to be from the upper paleolithic era. The upper paleolithic age began around 40,000 years ago and lasted till around 10,000 years ago.
Rao urged the Court to pass necessary orders to protect the site and seek response from the Haryana government.
The bench, also comprising justice Sudhanshu Dhulia, said, “This area may require protection” as it issued notice to the Haryana government seeking response. Posting the matter for January 9, the bench said, “The state of Haryana will file a response in this behalf and ensure that if the news report is correct, no damage is caused in the area.”
This is not the first time that this site has attracted the attention of archaeologists and historians. In 2021, cave paintings were discovered from Mangar in the Aravalli range. At that time, the state museum and archaeology department claimed the discovery to be one of the oldest cave arts in the country and sent a fact-finding team to the area.
These caves are situated in the mountain ranges of Aravalli just outside the national capital on the stretch connecting Gurugram and Faridabad. The Mangar Bani, a patch of primary forest in the region, is situated near to this site.
While tools from the Stone Age have been discovered in this region earlier, the discovery of rock art and cave paintings in 2021 was believed to be the first from the Aravalli range. The cave paintings discovered so far comprise images of human figurines, animals, foliage, besides rock art.
The ASI has been active in this region, which spans nearly 5,000 hectares. In 1986, a paleolithic site was discovered at Anangpur in Faridabad which led to further excavations in the region by ASI. As regards the present findings, the ASI team will be carrying out scientific experiments to ascertain the age of rocks. Experts suggest that in such sites, age of rocks can be ascertained by studying pigments which contain organic material that can be dated.","SC protects stone carvings at Aravalli, seeks Haryana’s response"

No wonder we continue to experience the perennial flooding and the collapse of buildings,” the minister said.He stressed that until such a time that the MMDAs were able to recruit qualified professionals to assist the processes of permit applications, they should consider outsourcing that important function to the professional bodies.He, therefore, charged the leadership of professionals in the built environment space to develop an intelligent arrangement to make his call work.The works and housing minister, who is also the Member of Parliament for the Bantama Constituency, stressed that this would not only lead to better-designed and safer buildings, but would also streamline the often-cumbersome permit application processes, as well as checking the quality of buildings to prevent their collapse.""Our cities and towns are rapidly evolving, and it is imperative that we adapt to these changes with precision and professionalism.While MMDAs are at the forefront of development controls, we must recognise that the complexity of this important role demands specialised expertise.Architects, along with other professionals, can bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table,” he added. Mr Asenso-Boakye further emphasised that this collaborative approach would contribute to the sustainable development of urban areas and improve the overall living conditions of citizens. ""We want our cities to be more than just concrete jungles; we want them to be thriving, aesthetically pleasing, and safe environments for all residents,"" he said.He appealed to MMDAs to respond to this call for collaboration with professional bodies.",MMDAs advised to outsource building permit issuance to professional bodies

https://inquirernewspaper.com/eu-and-liberia-50-years-of-partnership-for-peace-and-development/,"This year marks a significant milestone as we celebrate five decades of fruitful relations between Liberia and the European Union (EU). Throughout this period, this relationship has laid the foundation for a dynamic partnership that has continuously adapted to address both parties’ evolving needs and priorities. Over 50 years, the EU has consistently stood by Liberia, providing support for peace, stability, and development, even during challenging periods such as the civil wars, the Ebola outbreak, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Through various instruments and initiatives — from the European Development Fund (EDF) to the current NDICI-Global Europe, Global Gateway, and Team Europe — the EU,its Member States present in the country (Germany, Ireland, France and Sweden) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) have been playing a pivotal role in assisting Liberia on its journey toward a more prosperous, inclusive, and resilient society. Our partnership exemplifies the power of effective collaboration, enabling us to shape our actions and influence the future based on shared goals and values. It rests on three essential pillars: political dialogue, development cooperation, and economic cooperation. These pillars are critical in advancing Liberia’s progress and in addressing its challenges.
The EU and Liberia engage in regular political discussions, fostering an exchange of views on crucial topics such as peace, security, democracy, human rights, sustainable development, regional integration, and multilateral cooperation. These discussions build trust and understanding and help forge a shared vision for the future. Moreover, they enable cooperation on pressing global challenges such as climate change, terrorism, and pandemics. These shared values are clearly exemplified by the principled stand for peace and international law that the EU and Liberia have taken after the unprovoked and unjustified Russian aggression against Ukraine and the illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories by the Russian Federation.
Sustainable development in Liberia has been significantly advanced by the EU-Liberia development cooperation, which has supported vital sectors, including energy, roads, agriculture, health, education, and governance. By prioritizing initiatives that promote renewable energy, food security, gender equality, vocational training, anti-corruption measures, and electoral support, the EU has significantly improved the quality of life and means of subsistence for millions of Liberians. Between 2014 and 2023, the EU’s contribution to Liberia amounted to approximately 432 million US dollars.
Economic cooperation forms a vital foundation for the partnership between the EU and Liberia. Through its efforts in promoting trade, investment, and private-sector development, the EU has significantly driven Liberia’s economic growth. The EU remains Liberia’s key trade and investment partner. By fostering a favourable business environment, improving infrastructure, and advocating for sustainable economic practices, the EU has created opportunities, empowered local entrepreneurs, and contributed to job creation in Liberia.
Our commitment lies in establishing sustainable and equitable trade relations with Liberia and the wider West Africa region. In parallel, Liberia benefits from a most generous EBA scheme (Everything But Arms), which removes tariffs and quotas for all imports of goods (except arms and ammunition), coming into the EU from least developed countries (LDCs).
As we celebrate the progress brought about by our 50 years of partnership, we must also acknowledge that more work needs to be done. The EU remains unwavering in its support for Liberia’s development, promoting good governance, and safeguarding human rights and democracy. We recognize that Liberia faces significant challenges relating to governance and accountability, as well as to poverty, social exclusion, environmental degradation and deforestation. Nevertheless, we firmly believe that addressing these challenges necessitates the collective efforts of all stakeholders, including the government, civil society, the private sector, and development partners. The EU will continue collaborating closely with all stakeholders to overcome these obstacles and build a prosperous future for all.

Simple logic showed that Tshabangu would simply come again and block the candidates. Politics doesn’t work well with emotions. It needs a rational and dispassionate approach.
You don’t just plunge headlong, blinded by emotions and excitability inspiring yourself with end-time messages in a secular matter. That won’t work. Now CCC finds itself where ZANU-PF really wanted it. Cornered, divided and dazzled.
The escape route remains forming a new party now. It was even better done earlier before the disembowelment got this bloody but the oft stated emotions blocked any logic. With each new Tshabangu punch it’s clear the disdain to form a new party is mere obstinance not strategy.
Again CCC is failing to appreciate instances of the law against those of politics. You can never win law cases whilst parroting political mantras before Judges. In some cases accusations of captured courts are randomly thrown when the opposition has simply failed to do its job.
CCC leaders should simply be held to account for some of the blunders and unstrategic moves which have made the party a defenceless sheep. While the party has been under attack its leaders have made the situation even worse through not-so-brilliant decisions and moves.
In a normal country they should even consider resigning to maintain integrity. I challenge them to resign. When the initial recalls began they should have had all MPs and Councilors resign in protest and that was more strategic and powerful before the party became a dead weight.
They could have contested as independents caucusing together as a party. They didn’t take heed. Resultantly many are realizing how most of the politicians are simply there for their stomachs. All talk of protecting gains is convenient balderdash in the larger democracy war.

Wema Bank’s MD/CEO, Moruf Oseni, has identified innovative fiancing, among others, as key to resolving fundamental issues impacting Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and Women in Nigeria.
Oseni spoke during the Bank’s Donor Roundtable, tagged: “Innovative Financing: Gender-lens and climate resilient solution, held in Lagos.
He lamented that MSMEs, despite being the largest employers of labour across the country, suffer from problems of access to capital, development of critical managerial skills, access to markets, logistics challenges, a slowing economy, and heightened inflation which prevents most of them from growing or surviving.
The CEO bemoaned the complication of climate change, saying it spurred significant shifts in human behaviour, while adding further strain to societal dynamics.
According to him, to address these problems, there is a need to create bespoke and innovative financing models that bridge funding disparities.
Oseni stressed the need to ensure that these funding options offer flexibility and ease of access to the unique needs of Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs).
He said: “The world we face is a transformed one. The COVID-19 pandemic shut millions of people inside their homes and completely disrupted the global economy and the supply chain that underpins it. Global growth has been firmly below double digits for the last few years.
“Climate change has also unleashed a flood of migrants from the developing world into more developed countries. Pockets of conflict on the global stage have further exacerbated the growth problems we were already experiencing.
“The burden of this transformed world disproportionately falls on the youth and women in particular who face higher unemployment rates across every strata of society.
“We must ensure that funding options offer flexibility and ease of access to the unique needs of SMEs.”
Co-founder, Africa Sustainable Trade, Dr. Ama Onyerinma, stressed the need to tackle the issues of gender inequality, noting that there is a challenge for women in entrepreneur.

Though the ABC programme was started in 2010, where dogs were caught, sterilised and returned to the same area, it could not be continued due to various reasons. Recently however, the civic body roped in veterinarians and a study, using global position system (GPS) and scientific methods, was conducted to estimate the population of dogs. An NGO was selected and permission was obtained from government bodies to execute the ABC programme with two veterinarians. The NGO is being paid ₹1,650 per dog to catch, sterilise and administer the anti-rabies vaccine at the centre. The NGO will then return the dogs to their respective areas. The facility at Solar has a shelter home with an operation theatre and pre-and-post operative wards.Currently, a vehicle with 12 compartments is used to transport dogs to Solar while 24 dogs are sterilised and vaccinated a day. The dogs are allowed to recuperate for five days at the centre and then dropped back their areas. The process began on January 9, 2024, and about 600 dogs have been sterilised so far. Since it may take many months to sterilise all the dogs, during which their population could increase, the civic body has decided to create an additional surgery room and induct additional vehicles for transportation.A senior health officer told The Hindu that the new room would help to operate on an additional 24 dogs so that on an average 1,200 dogs are sterilised a month. “Currently, the civic body spends ₹10 lakh a month for the programme and it would have to spend another ₹10 lakh to sterilise more dogs,” the official said and added that expediting the programme would help in controlling the dog population.

The gap between the rich and poor are widening as subsidies to the poor were withdrawn,"" he said.Kharge said that the BJP was pursuing anti-women policies.

Atrocities towards the marginalised section are increasing. As many as 51 cases of  crime against women are being registered in the country every hour,"" he said.In order to counter BJP's bids to tap the Christian vote banks, Kharge also highlighted the Manipur tension and criticised the Prime Minister for not visiting Manipur. He asked why Modi could not visit Manipur even when Congress leader Rahul Gandhi could.Accusing the BJP of seeking votes based on caste, creed and religion, Kharge said that the voters should consider the election as an opportunity to ""save the country and its democracy"" by not allowing the BJP to win.Even as the ruling CPM-led Left Democratic Front is Congress' main opponent in Kerala, Kharge refrained from attacking much the Left-front during his public address in Kerala.Most sitting MPs to remain in the frayAhead of Kharge's visit, Congress senior leaders held discussions on selecting candidates for the Lok Sabha polls. There was a general consensus that all the 14 sitting MPs, except Kannur MP and Kerala PCC president K Sudhakaran, should recontest.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is also likely to recontest from Wayanad even as the CPM and CPI had expressed displeasure that it would weaken the joint fight of the opposition parties against the BJP at the national level as BJP is not the principal opponent of the Congress in Kerala. In Kerala, the direct fight is mainly between the Congress-led UDF and CPM-led LDF.Meanwhile, Congress' key coalition partner in Kerala Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) is seeking one more additional seat apart from the two it is now having.

A communication from the office of S K Das, Secretary, ECI, has called for the suspension of the sub-divisional officer, tehsildar and sub-divisional police officer. It has also asked Maharashtra’s chief secretary to seek an explanation from Pune Collector and Superintendent of Police for failing to maintain the security protocols for the strongroom where the EVMs were stored.
Deputy District Election Officer Minal Kalaskar said a notice has been issued to SDO Purandar in connection with the theft.

Meanwhile, the Pune Rural police have arrested two suspects in connection with the theft of the EVM unit and recovered the stolen EVM from them. Police, however, said the motive behind the theft was being ascertained.
The preliminary probe by the Pune Rural police has revealed that the theft took place on the night of February 3 at the strongroom, the locked secure storage facility inside the tehsildar office in Saswad. The facility at the time had several EVM units kept in separate carrying cases. After the theft came to light, the police obtained the footage from the security cameras installed on the premises.
Superintendent of Police (Pune Rural) Pankaj Deshmukh said, “We have arrested two suspects in connection with the theft and have recovered from them the stolen EVM. We are investigating the motive behind the theft.”
On Tuesday, the police had said three suspects could be seen in the security camera footage. An officer said that the search for accomplices of the arrested persons was on.

The police have identified the arrested suspects as Shivaji Ramdas Bandgar (21) alias Bhaiyya and Ajinkya Raju Salunkhe (21), both from Purandar. Police sources said the two are criminals on police record and may have targeted the strongroom thinking it was housing something of value. “Because the EVMs were kept in carrying cases looking like suitcases, they might have picked up one. A thorough probe into their motive is now being conducted,” an officer said.
Officials said the building where the theft took place is old. At the time of the incident, a police guard was deployed at the premises for security.

https://nation.africa/kenya/counties/baringo/-a-daughter-s-search-for-her-father-bears-unexpected-outcome--4546204,"In 2008 when she was in form two, Ms Anne Chacha,34, embarked on a journey to look for her father, a man she hardly knew.
Her decision was motivated by alleged ill-treatment by her stepfather, whom she publicly rejected.
According to the mother of three, due to domestic issues, her mother Lucia Wankuru had left her matrimonial home in Kuria, Migori County, in the early 1980’s and set out to Nairobi to start a new life. She settled in Kibra.
“I have six older siblings. At the time my mother left her matrimonial home, I hadn’t been born yet, so she left with my sister who was the youngest, and left behind the other older siblings in Kuria. She started a new life in Kibra, Nairobi and some years later I was born to another man,” said Ms Chacha who lives in Utawala, Nairobi.
When she grew up, Ms Chacha's mother informed her that her father hailed from Baringo County and that he worked at the Nairobi club at the time.

“I was born and raised in Kibra. I remember one day, when I was in lower primary school my mother told me that my father comes from Baringo County. He sometimes visited us but they later parted ways with my mother after he left Nairobi. The last I saw him was when I was seven.”
“Despite the challenges of raising me singlehandedly, all went well until I joined a secondary school in Kuria. I was in a boarding school but during the half term break, I used to spend time at my step brothers’ home because I could not travel all the way to Nairobi…. that is where my troubles started,” she narrated.
She remembers one time when she was very sick and her stepfather passed by.
“I was in form two at the time and I was on my half-term break. As usual, I spent time at my stepbrother's home to cut down on the costs of travelling to Nairobi where we lived with my mother.
I was sick at the time and had convulsions. On spotting my stepfather passing by, a neighbour called him to come and check on my condition and he retorted that I wasn’t his child. His response hit me hard. I felt rejected and I vowed to trace my biological father,” said Ms Chacha.
In August 2008, schools closed and she went back to Nairobi. She informed her mother that she wanted to go and look for her father in Baringo.
“We had relocated from Kibra and my mother sent me to go and look for my father’s best friend, a Cosmas Cheruiyot, whom they lived together in Kibra in the 1980s, indicating that he knew his name and the village where my father came from. I found him and he gave me the details and that he came from Kabartonjo in Baringo North,” she explained.
“He told me that my father was David Amdany and he instructed me to go to Kabartonjo town and ask for him, claiming that he was a renowned person and I would be directed to his village,”
Through assistance from a friend and a security officer who worked in Marigat, Baringo South, Ms Chacha embarked on a mission to trace her roots.
“I spent a week with the friend who worked in Marigat town but I got tired and the mission to proceed to Kabartonjo where I was directed to aborted,” she said.
A year later, (2009) Ms Chacha's mother passed on and she halted the mission and completed her secondary school education. Her elder sister took on the responsibility of taking care of her.
Last year, she saw a lady on TikTok who had posted something and she claimed to come from her father’s hometown- Kabartonjo.
She commented on the post, indicating that she was looking for her father whom she had scanty information about and she was requesting help to trace him.
She didn’t respond but a man who saw the comment replied to her and they exchanged their contacts and he offered to help her.
“This year, the man called and told me that he had shared the information with a certain teacher from the area who was vocal on social media so that he could post the same on his Facebook page. That was a turning point for me, I must say. It is through the post he made that locals from the region traced my father’s relatives,” noted Ms Chacha.
Katebes Kibet, the teacher, said he was contacted by a friend on February 18 that there was a woman who had shared some information on TikTok, and seemed to have been trying to trace her father without success.
“The friend knew I was vocal on Facebook and requested that I share the information to assist the woman in distress to trace her father. I spoke with Chacha and she gave me the details. Some few hours after I made the post, several people came to my inbox who used to work at the Nairobi club in the 1980s,” said Mr Kibet.
Through locals, they traced Ms Chacha’s father to Kapcheserem in Bartolimo village in Baringo North but they had to follow up and know the exact details.
James Amdany, whose father also worked at the Nairobi club and lived in Kibra called the tutor and informed him that the woman may be his half-sister.

“He told me that they used to visit his father who was staying in Kibra when he was working at the Nairobi club during the December holidays and he remembers a rumour of their father having sired a child out of wedlock, information that was also corroborated by his mother.
I gave him Chacha’s contact so that he could get more information from her. They met in Nairobi the following day,” said Mr Kibet.
On Saturday, the duo went looking for Mr Cheruiyot, who was working with Amdany at the club and confirmed that Ms Chacha was James’ half-sister.
Unfortunately, for Ms Chacha her father had died back in 2019.
“When I saw the post, I contacted the teacher who posted it because the details matched that of my late father who worked at the Nairobi club.
We followed up on the matter and even went to meet my father’s friend who lived with him in Kibra and confirmed that Chacha was my sister. My father even used to pay for her schooling at the time before he went to the village,” said Mr Amdany.
“The old man even took us to where Chacha’s mother was living before she died and we met their neighbours who identified her. We are happy that we have finally met with our sister and we are organising a family reunion at our rural home. Although she traced her roots after the passing of our father, we are happy that she finally met her relatives,” he said.
Ms Chacha told Nation.Africa that she was hopeful that she would find her father alive and the revelation that he died in 2019 broke her heart.
“I was very optimistic that my father was still alive. It was very painful to learn that after looking for him for more than 16 years my father had died five years earlier of illness.
I just wanted to see him even for one more time because I still had a little memory of him,” said Ms Chacha amid sobs.
“All along, I was looking for him at least to have a father figure in my life and also to trace my roots, having faced rejection in life. Though I found out that he is dead, I am happy at least I traced my brother and I now know my people,” she added.",A daughter's long search for her father bears unexpected outcome

https://thenationonlineng.net/inec-has-refused-to-obey-supreme-court-judgment-on-apga/,"‘INEC has refused to obey Supreme Court judgment on APGA’
The National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Edozie Njoku has been in a leadership tussle with factional chairman, Victor Oye. In this interview with reporters in Abuja, Njoku chides the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for refusing to recognise him as leader of the APGA despite a Supreme Court order. ERIC IKHILAE reports
Why has APGA remained perpetually in a leadership crisis?
Let me answer that very simply. Any party in a country with a rule of law, who has gotten to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court has given a judgment and maybe you say the judgment is ambiguous, and it has gone to be enforced by a lower court, and the lower court has said, party move out of the office, you are not the chairman, and INEC don’t recognize him and INEC is still recognizing. INEC is in a better position to answer this question because it refused to obey a Supreme Court judgment that settled the crisis in the party. Why is it interested in prolonging the crisis in the party?
Are you laying the blame on the INEC chairman?
There is a court judgment there from the Supreme Court and the lower court enforcing it, and he’s not obeying it. The question should be, why is he not obeying it?
What is Mahmood’s interest? Is he a member of APGA? He should obey the court order.
When Timipre Silva was removed as the APC governorship candidate in Bayelsa State, he immediately obeyed the order. Is there any order less ambiguous than this order of court? But he obeyed Silva’s order and as soon as Silva won in the Court of Appeal, his name was reinstated. Why don’t you follow that same trend?
But this crisis predates Prof Mahmood’s tenure. The APGA has always had a leadership crisis; there was a time when it had three national chairmen. You were heading one of the factions…
No, I had gone to the UPP. It was Umeh and Okwu. Then, I had left APGA.
Is reconciliation still possible in APGA?
When we won in the Federal High Court, I’m sure you saw it in the media and it was on Arise TV, I said it and I told them that my recommendation to the party was for myself and Oye to step aside to allow us to build the party, by bringing in someone else as the national chairman. But, they all said I was a madman. Till I have now won in the Supreme Court. Yes, we’re very open to reconciliation.
Are you still open to the idea of the two of you stepping aside?
That was then; not any more. I have won the legal battle as the national chairman and I intend to carry on and fight the battle to the end. There is going to be reconciliation. What we need is the recognition to do reconciliation.
There is a perception out there that the APGA has some kind of working agreement with the APC and President Tinubu. What’s your response to that?
If we had a legitimate leadership and it decides that working with the APC will be in the interest of the majority of its people, why not? At the moment, the party has not been built up to the standard in which we in the NWC want to build it; it’s more or less looking like an Igbo party with inverted commas. This is because it has a very big support in the grassroots of the Southeast.
But the question is whether that engagement or whatever they are doing is illegitimate. As far as the Supreme Court is concerned, they don’t have the right to do that. They are using Prof Mahmood to hang on to power. In the true sense of it, they should not be the ones discussing that engagement because the people are not with them. As you can see from the election, they don’t enjoy the support of the people.
What’s your relationship with Governor Soludo?
I don’t have any relationship. I’ve spoken with him for about an hour once and he’s sworn to different people that over his dead body will I be national chairman. But, we’ve never met; I’ve not sat down with him before. Even a very big businessman in Anambra State tried everything to bring us together to negotiate. But, he turned down the offer.
He knows the reason why he doesn’t want to meet me.
Soludo is the only governor currently elected on the APGA platform. What could be the reason why he is against your chairmanship of the party?
He mentioned something about a Catholic bishop going as far as saying that the APGA is an Anambra party. Now, to rephrase your question, to what extent is some religious cabal responsible for Soludo’s obstinate position in the APGA leadership crisis?
You see, I wanted to be very clear on what you were saying. My clearness on that is that there is a very big misconception that even we as Nigerians must grow beyond.
There are 36 states in the country. Until Peter (Obi) became governor, we had nobody. That Alex Oti and Stanley Amuche did not become governors in 2018 on the APGA platform was because of the role that the then-Governor Willie Obiano played.
The party is different from the governor. The governor used the party, no matter what anybody thinks, as a vehicle to get to where he is. So, he should use his position to destroy the party.
One thing people must learn is to stop taking stipends from the governor. Work with him and be straightforward with him; treat him with decency, even if you don’t like him.
But the party must be run like a party. If he wakes up from his sleep and feels that he doesn’t like my way, he doesn’t have anything to do with the price of garri. We have won at the Supreme Court and I’m the national chairman of the party. So, it’s not up to him alone to decide who he works with; he’s not the party.
The APGA is supposed to be a national party because the secretary is from the north. Why is the crisis restricted to the Southeast?
No, the crisis is not restricted to the Southeast.
But the people that went to court…
Look at the names of the people who got this judgment. Otunba Latif, Ogida, and Alh. Rabiu is the one who got this judgment. It’s not me.
Your tenure will be ending in May; I don’t know whether you will be interested in re-contesting. The current atmosphere in the party may lead to a succession crisis…
When we get to the bridge, we’ll cross the bridge. But the most important thing now is that we’re a country of the rule of law; the judgments should be obeyed. If by then he gets all the judgments against me, then we’re out. You understand? And he has all the resources to do that. But judgments should be obeyed.
That’s the point I came to explain here, that judgments should be obeyed. No matter the sentiments behind it, because we’ve been through a lot with different governors to be able to achieve all these judgments. Is it not the work of God?
So, if the judgments have been gotten, and what it is, it’s for the world to come out and say, obey the judgments because if he has won at the Supreme Court, I wouldn’t be sitting down here talking about what I’m saying. If he had won in this one, I wouldn’t come here and be saying what I’m saying. I would have gone back to my bed and slept.
But the fact that we have won makes it incumbent on him, even if he’s the president, to obey the order. I was not happy to see the CBN governor when he was there lamenting about orders not being obeyed.
So, now, he must learn to obey orders because he will not be there forever. That’s the crux of what I’m saying. I’m not just talking about APGA. The party has its problems, which I believe we will sort out internally. But the most important thing is to obey the orders.
What is your assessment of the current state of the nation?
I just got back from England on January 2. As you know, I’m from the Southeast. I just lamented where we find ourselves as we talk about the state of the nation. I’m sure the president of Nigeria is also lamenting about the state of affairs in Nigeria today. In 2012, we used to take our ATM (from Nigeria) to buy things in England. You could go to the ATM and get money; just as recently as in 2012. We used it to use our ATM card to shop in England and you will get the money at even a slightly better rate than the black market.
Three years after that, when Buhari now came, they stopped and started rationing it; the maximum you could take was 200 pounds. Now, it’s non-existent. But that notwithstanding, most Nigerians can’t afford to travel abroad, so that should not be a norm.
Coming back to Nigeria, you see the level of poverty we have. You see the price of petrol. You see the price of food. You see the price of everything. You ask yourself, how does a normal person survive? If you take a taxi from here to where we were, it’s about a 10, 15-minute drive. In England, it will be about 12 pounds. Do you understand? And then that man will use the 12 pounds, some of it, to repair his car.
But here, the guy told me N8,000 and I’m pricing him N7,000. Do you understand? So, our problem is so endemic. If you look at a new hotel within four years, it will be run down. It will be so people in the eye, that it will eventually run down. You employ someone who’s begging you, telling you that his life depends on the job. In three years, you see his outlook in life has changed.
You go to a church, you see young children eating biscuits, and drinking coke inside the church. It was never like that when I was young. You see, leaving a church, you see children running up and down. Go abroad, you see people standing in the line. But, here, you will see a big man jumping the queue to pay before somebody else at the supermarket. You will equally see your driver driving through red lights. You see all kinds of things. Then, you ask yourself, where did Nigeria go wrong? So if you’re asking about the economy, nobody can ever, that’s a question that should not even be asked because we see daily that it’s in a mess.
You cannot blame President Bola Tinubu; you cannot blame anybody because Nigeria has gone to a stage whereby even our moral standards have all been eroded. A country where the Supreme Court can give a judgment and one man sits in his office and says, I slighted him; I will never give it to him. It’s not his father’s own. It is God that gives power. Eventually, he will give me that, and I will get that recognition because it’s God who gives power, not man.
So, what’s the way forward?
The way forward is that I’m running to be the national chairman of the APGA and my focus is on how to rebuild the party to become a forward-moving party. The question of the way forward in Nigeria would be better addressed by the ministers and the president.
But, in your opinion, what is the way forward in Nigeria?

https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/04/05/thousands-begin-raya-exodus-from-labuan-terminals,"LABUAN: The annual Hari Raya exodus here commenced Friday (April 5), witnessing a surge of passengers flocking to Labuan's two terminals, namely the roll on-roll off (roro) ferry terminal and passenger boat terminal.
Preparedness was evident as management companies for the terminals geared up for the anticipated rush, offering both online ticket sales and over-the-counter services.
Labuan's roro ferry operator, Labuan Mainland Link Sdn Bhd (LML) chairman, Datuk Chin Hong Vui assured travellers of smooth sailing experiences, saying that the four ferries were primed for journeys from Labuan to mainland Sabah.
""The ferries are well-maintained and fully crewed...we remain committed to providing better services, especially during festive seasons,” Chin told Bernama Friday.
LML operates four ferries - Goodwill Star, Kimanis 2, and Joy Star, and the flagship ferry, Putrajaya 1, boasting a capacity of 85 vehicles and 500 passengers, while Goodwill Star accommodates 85 vehicles and 420 passengers.
Kimanis 1 and Joy Star each cater to 55 vehicles and 220 passengers.
Highlighting the importance of timely arrival at terminals, Chin urged travellers to ensure prompt immigration clearance to avoid any inconvenience.
Meanwhile, Labuan Point Enterprise, responsible for ferry ticketing for LML, initiated ticket sales two months prior, witnessing sold-out tickets for the Labuan-Menumbok-Labuan route from April 5 to 9.
Its manager, Robert Ling Song Shieng, said additional trips were applied to accommodate the high demand.
Labuan Marine Department Director Alimuddin Amirudin also disclosed the approval of 19 extra trips to two Labuan ferry operators - LML and Juta Bonus Sdn Bhd.
Juta Bonus, operating the Galaxy and Blue Ocean ferries, is increasing its trips to meet the surge in demand from April 5 to 9, with the aim to provide four to five trips daily.
In parallel, passenger speed boat services are also ramping up operations.
Labuan International Ferry Terminal management company, LDA Holdings Sdn Bhd, announced a boost to 40 daily trips from Labuan to Menumbok starting April 5, anticipating a surge on weekends.
Its chief executive officer, Noor Halim Zaini, assured the company's continuous commitment to ensuring safety of travellers, citing last year's successful operation despite exceeding initial trip targets.
LDA Holdings caters to travellers heading to Menumbok, Sipitang, Sabah, Lawas and Limbang, Sarawak and Muara Brunei.
""We are dedicated to facilitating Labuan travellers in celebrating Hari Raya with their families,” Nor Halim said, underscoring the round-the-clock efforts to ensure seamless services.
""With 13 passenger boats currently operational, Labuan International Ferry Terminal is poised to facilitate the influx of 'Hari Raya balik kampung' travellers in the coming days,” he said. - Bernama",Thousands begin Raya exodus from Labuan terminals

https://dailynews.co.tz/special-report-what-cng-users-players-say/,"TANZANIA: MOTORISTS have urged the government to increase the number of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) filling stations in the country, for it to become a mass-market product.
 They also insisted that CNG cars will need a dense network of filling stations to address long queues and congestion. They lamented on increasing re-filling delays resulting from an increase in number of vehicles switching to gas use.
 The motorists also called on the government to deploy measures, which will help to reduce the cost of converting the vehicles from fuel to gas system to enable more people to afford the service.
 Experts say switching to CNG may seem relatively inexpensive and the benefits outweigh the use of fuel. They argue that one kilogramme of gas that sells at 1, 550/- is cheaper compared to fuel (diesel/petrol) that rotates around 3200/-.
 Equally, they noted that gas emits around 15–20 per cent less carbon dioxide (CO2) in comparison to diesel/petrol fuel. Tabling a report on activities undertaken by the Parliamentary Committee on Energy and Mineral in 2023 in the National Assembly recently, Chairman Dr Mathayo David said that the number of vehicles using CNG has increased from 1,139 in 2020/2021 to 3,000 vehicles in 2022/2023.
 He said the situation is due to the fact that CNG is cheaper by 40 per cent compared to fuel especially in Dar es Salaam, Coast and Mtwara regions.
 “The increase in number of vehicles using CNG has caused long queues at the five gas filling stations available in the country thus forcing motorists to spend long time at the stations,” Dr David said.
 A CNG fuelling station consists of a compressor, a gas dryer, storage vessels, dispensers and underground piping. Usually, CNG stations are installed where there is already a natural gas pipe in the ground. There are two main types of CNG refuelling systems: fast-fill and time-fill.
 The Dar es Salaam City, which is a country’s business hub currently, has only three fully operating CNG stations, located at Ubungo, Temeke and Ilala albeit the increase in number of citizens who convert their vehicles from fuel powered to gas. In that regard, motorists interviewed by the ‘Daily News’ recently, requested for addition of more stations to save time and attract more motorists to switch into the system.
 “The government must act now to facilitate this potential growth, especially in the number of natural gas filling stations,” said taxi driver, Mr Sadat Hamissi (35). Mr Hamissi lamented that he has been incurring losses in his business due to the refilling delays as he is forced to stay for long hours in queues.
 “Sometime, I spend almost six hours when there is long queue. Addition of more gas stations will address the problem especially to us, who operate commercial taxi and other citizens as we catch with transition to alternative energy use,” he said.
 Mr Hamissi called upon the government to attract more investors in the energy sector, who will support its effort on building the country’s economy and full commercialisation of the available natural gas.
 Highlighting the benefits of using gases, he said it provides relief to them by covering many kilometres without the need for re-filling. He said it is six months so far since he opted to convert his combustion engine from petrol powered to gas.
 Another taxi driver who denied mentioning his name said it is now the right time for every pump station to have gas station, saying the move will enhance a competitive market in the energy sector.
 He said spending more time for re-filling has been causing psychological torture apart from having minimal production time in a day.
 Equally, Mr Hashim Sadala (37) urged potential investors to tap the emerging new gas market. He said increase in number of gas stations will make the city’s taxi business more vibrant and uplift country’s economic growth.
 Resident of Dar es Salaam, Mr Mzee Mahyenga (71) who had also converted his car to CNG, noted that he used about 3m/- to switch his petrol-powered vehicle to gas but regrets the time he spends to re-fill.
 For her part, Director of the Anric Gas Technology Company Limited, Engineer Mercy Chilumba said that their company has noticed an increase in the number of vehicles, from refilling 20 vehicles per month to 100 cars. “Every day we experience an increase of three new customers,” Eng Chilumba said.
 Eng Chilumba said the rise in number of CNG powered vehicles is due to increase of car engine converting from either petrol or diesel to gas.
 “The big challenge is scarcity of CNG filling stations, the increase in number of gas-powered vehicles should go hand in hand with addition in number of filling stations,” Eng Chilumba said.
 She said the Anric Gas Technology Company Limited also has been planning for expansion to serve more vehicles. Underlining the benefits of CNG, she said the natural gas almost cuts 55 per cent of running cost of a vehicle when it comes to re-filling.
 Explaining the government’s stance toward embracing and fostering CNG, the Energy and Water Utility Regulatory Authority’s (EWURA) Communication and Public Relation Manager, Mr Titus Kaguo said EWURA in collaboration with the Tanzania Petroleum Services (TPS) and other stakeholders have reformed the Petroleum Facility Standard (PFC) to allow all filling stations across the country to encompass CNG.
 “From now any person can have a CNG and petroleum stations all together, provided he or she meets environment impact assessment and land requirements. It is all about compliance,” Mr Kaguo told the ‘Daily News’ in an exclusive interview recently.
 Likewise, he appealed to all investors in the country to catch opportunities emerging in the gas value chain through among others constructing the CNG filling stations.
 Mr Kaguo said the policy and legal reform will address the shortage of CNG filling stations as countrywide there is over 2,500 filling stations which upon establishing the gas refilling facilities could serve all CNG powered vehicles.
 He said as of now the country has 4,500 CNG powered vehicles mainly concentrated in Dar es Salaam but with capacity of refilling 2,500 vehicles per day.
 In that regard, he said the conversion rate is high as on November last year (2023) there were 3,000 CNG vehicles in the country. Mr Kaguo said the country has five operating CNG stations of which, two are owned by the Africa business and industrialist tycoon, Mr Aliko Dangote which refill only the Dangote Group’s trucks.
 They are located in Mtwara and Dar es Salaam. He said the remaining three are all situated in Dar es Salaam including the Anric Gas Technology Limited, PanAfrican Energy Tanzania Limited and Taqa Arabia Limited.","SPECIAL REPORT: What CNG users, players say"

Dear Mrs Macaulay,
I am a foreigner and I have been married to a Jamaican woman for five years. My wife had a small and uncomfortable house when we met. I enlarged this small house and renovated the old part of the house to provide comfort for both of us, and her adult daughter. I often came back to Jamaica and did construction work. I also took care of the area around the house — ie, fences, garden planning, utility, facilities, etc.
Because of her adult daughter, who is doing everything to separate us, provoking constant arguments between my wife and I, our marriage is falling apart and I will probably file for divorce because I can no longer stand being treated like a total zero. Now my wife and her adult daughter keep telling me that this is not my home. They say I have nothing here and I have no say here. A few days before the wedding, we bought a car in instalments, which I also sent money to pay off over five years. The car is registered in my wife’s name and has not yet been paid off, because my wife said that the repayment will take two years longer because it is better this way.
Everything was fine until I finished the house, but now things have changed.
Throughout my time working in Europe, I denied myself everything in order to send as much of my saved money as possible to my wife for the above-mentioned purposes. I did it for all of us, not for myself. I am almost 60 years old and spine problems prevent me from starting my life over again.
Now, during our arguments, my wife tells me that if I want, I can leave. I will be left with nothing, because this is their home. I can leave, the only question is where to go, since I gave them everything.
I’m alone here and have no one to turn to for help.
Before I start any divorce proceedings, please provide some information regarding separation or division of property. Please let me know whether I have the right to apply for division of property or recovery of my full financial contribution.
I am so sorry that your marriage is being undermined by your stepdaughter, and more upsetting and disgusting is that your wife is permitting or colluding with her daughter to instigate arguments.
Your wife’s conduct is shameful because she should have strictly ensured that her daughter did not comment or interfere in her marital affairs, but she never seemed to have curbed her interference.
You were and are not even given any respect by your wife and her adult daughter, nor have they shown any gratitude for the improvements you made to the home and their standard of life. Their unfeeling, dishonest and utter lack of respect for the law and lack of any standards of fairness is astounding, and this makes me very angry, not only because their conduct is predicated to give Jamaican women a bad reputation as users of men for their own financial and property gains, but because it is so disgusting.
The mother and daughter clearly believe that as a foreigner you know nothing of Jamaican family laws, and most particularly about family property division laws or the legal principle of refunds of the whole or part of monies expended by one spouse or person on property belonging to another, or on the family home with the owner’s knowledge and agreement. I am pleased that you mentioned these and are asking me to assist you to understand more about the laws and processes, before you proceed to file a petition for the dissolution of your marriage.
You and the mother are married and pursuant to the Property (Rights of Spouses) Act, you are entitled to one-half share in the family home even if your wife is the registered proprietor of the real property. This is also the case about the motor car, which is personal property. The court faced with an application to make a declaration of the respective interests of each spouse in the relevant real and personal properties registered in your wife’s name, and to make consequential orders for the division, manner of division and manner of settlement of the entitled interests on the said parties, must take into account certain factors provided in the said Act, which the court deems relevant in dealing with the issue, whether it would be unreasonable or unjust for each spouse to be entitled to 50 per cent each. This means that in circumstances such as yours, the court must examine the facts and circumstance, and in applying the factors may decide that one party, for example, you, are entitled to a greater percentage of interest of the current increased value of the family home and regarding the motor vehicle, because of the value of your contribution for the improvements you made for the family home, and regarding the car, for the number of years during which you paid the instalments for the purchase of the vehicle.
The fact that one spouse is the owner of the property (family home and car), does not erase your legal and statutory right to your share of either 50 per cent, or more, in such properties or their value. What you did for the family home for the use and comfort of “the family” increased the value of what had been a small, aged and uncomfortable house, when you and your wife met.
You and your wife being married are pursuant to section 6 of the Act, and are presumptively entitled to 50 per cent each of the interest/value of the family home. The same applies to the car. You do not have to have been married for five years to be so entitled. However, common-law spouses only qualify to have such shares when they, being single, have cohabited together as if they were man and wife for not less than five years.
The 50 per cent shares in the family home must be based on the fact the family home was in the sole ownership of one of the spouses. If this was so when you invested your monies as aforesaid, then the 50/50 presumptive provision would apply, but with the proviso that the court could make a higher award to one of the parties, as stated above. If your wife has taken steps to add her daughter’s name as a joint legal proprietor with her after your infusion of money and works to extend and refurbish and improve the existing old structure, or in the course of you providing those monies, you ought to, in your application, apply for an order for the court to set such a joinder of the daughter on the title aside on the ground that it was done to deprive you of your interest therein.
If, on the other hand, the daughter had been on the title before your marriage and your infusion of the capital sums to improve the premises, and this was not disclosed to you, and your wife and her daughter had you believe that your wife was the sole owner, then you would be entitled to claim the refund of your investment plus your percentage of the increased value of the premises which resulted from your actions.
You must obtain the services of a good family law attorney to act for you. Your application for your interest in the real and personal properties within your marriage can be done, because of your wife’s repeated statements that you can leave the home and that you will leave with nothing because the family home is their home. This is palpably untrue and an attempt to deny you your rightful share of the value of the premises and of the car. By making these statements you wife has raised questions as to the title to or possession of the property and so you can therefore apply to the court to determine these questions and the judge can, on such a claim, make orders for the sale of the property, and for the payment of a sum of money held to be your spousal share of the subject properties.
You can make your application for your shares on the grant of your decree of the dissolution of your marriage or after you and your wife have separated and there is no reasonable likelihood of a reconciliation, or if you can prove that your wife is endangering the property or seriously diminishing the value of the property by mis-management or by other means. To make any of the first two applications, you must file within 12 months of the dissolution or separation or within a longer period granted by the court upon an application.
The Act contains provisions for the date for the valuation of the properties, the factors to be consider by the court in the making of a division of the family home and other properties, and provisions for protecting against actions to dispose of interests in property in order to deprive the other party of their interest or diminish the same, which is stated to be an offence for which the party so acting would be liable on summary conviction before a parish court to pay a fine of up to one million dollars or to imprisonment for up to a maximum term of 12 months, or to both a fine and imprisonment. If plans are afoot to defeat your rights or your claim, you can apply to the court to make an order restraining your wife from so acting and/or to order (if she sells the house or car) that she pays the entire proceeds into the court to be dealt with as the court directs.
I believe that I have dealt with enough of the existing law to enable you to decide to retain the services of a lawyer to assist and act for you with the preparation of your claim and to represent you in court.
I must advise you that if your wife suggests that you enter into a settlement agreement with her rather that have the matter dealt with by the court, that you do not agree and sign and act on such an agreement without asking your lawyer to peruse it and advise you accordingly. You have suffered enough and must do all you can to protect your interests in order to ensure that you obtain your full entitlements.
I hope that I have assisted you and if you need further assistance, just ask for it.
All the very best.

Vietnamese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer VinFast is setting its sights on regional expansion, with the Philippines as its latest target market.
Driven by the immense potential of the Philippine EV market, VinFast leveraged its expansion to become a major player in Southeast Asia’s burgeoning EV industry.
“Many people ask why Vingroup created VinFast. We do it because we feel the need to contribute to society, not just to do business. A large, successful enterprise with certain capabilities has a duty to contribute to its homeland,” said VinFast founder Pham Nhat Vuong.
The company said the Philippines offers a promising market for electric vehicles given its large population and growing demand for sustainable transportation. The country also holds a strategic advantage as the world’s second-largest supplier of nickel, a key component in EV battery cells.
VinFast, established in 2017, is a subsidiary of Vingroup, Vietnam’s largest conglomerate. It holds the distinction of being Vietnam’s first domestic automaker and a pioneer in the country’s electric vehicle revolution.
Founded by a billionaire known for his bold vision and decisive action, VinFast surprised the industry with its rapid launch of gasoline-powered vehicles just a year after its inception.
The company leveraged its parent company’s expertise in construction and real estate to build its manufacturing facilities and establish a nationwide network of charging stations in Vietnam.
VinFast secured partnerships with BMW, Pininfarina and Bosch, further accelerating its technological development.
Experts predict a significant growth in the Philippine EV market over the coming years. The Electric Vehicle Association of the Philippines (EVAP) forecasts a massive increase in EVs, with projections reaching 6.6 million units by 2030.",Vietnamese EV maker eyes expansion in PH

_x000D_
According to Franklin Cudjoe, the founder and president of IMANI Africa, the newly appointed lawyer for the EC, Philip Jimanor, was not present during court proceedings on Tuesday, June 18, 2024, which infuriated Justice Owoahene Acheampong.
_x000D_
Cudjoe, in a post shared on Facebook on June 18, 2024, stated that the judge could not comprehend why the EC’s lawyers keep absenting themselves from proceedings, because its previous lawyer, Sekyi-Boampong, was also always absent.
_x000D_
“At the High Court in Ho on Tuesday, June 18, 2024, His Lordship Justice Owoahene Acheampong expressed his displeasure at the absence of the lawyer for the Electoral Commission, Justin Amenuvor, in court.
_x000D_
“The judge referred to a previous occasion when he had similarly commented on the absence of the previous lawyer for the EC, Mr. Sekyi-Boampong. He could not understand why lawyers for the EC would not be in court and why no representative of such a state institution would be present either,” he wrote.
_x000D_
During proceedings on Tuesday, the court heard an application by the lawyer for the petitioners, Philip Jimanor, for leave to file amended replies to answers filed by both the Electoral Commission and the second respondent in the petition, John Peter Amewu, the Member of Parliament for Hohoe and Minister for Railway Development.
_x000D_
Peter Amewu’s lawyer, Benedict Kofitse, was, however, in court and did not oppose the application.
_x000D_
The judge granted the application and adjourned the case to Thursday, June 20, 2024.
_x000D_
The case, initiated by Prof. Margaret Kweku, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) parliamentary candidate for the 2020 election and four others, challenges the declaration of Amewu as the winner, citing the disenfranchisement of approximately 17,000 voters from the Santrokofi, Akpafu, Lolobi, and Likpe (SALL) traditional areas.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/the-challenges-of-big-data-101717754594891.html,"In a democracy, Big Data is emerging as the invisible hand that shapes political narratives and predicts outcomes with a precision that was once the domain of oracles. This was evident in the recent elections when political parties wielded it to orchestrate their strategies and campaigns. But this column is not about politics, rather it is about how Big Data is deployed, what it does to us, and whether we should be concerned by how it’s used. (Representative Photo)
But first, what exactly is Big Data? Imagine an ocean with countless points of information that contains voter preferences, social media interactions, and demographic details. Political parties cast their nets to analyse, understand and predict voter behaviour. All this morphs into campaign strategies. The ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), for example, is a master at this and stormed into power back in 2014 by leveraging Big Data to craft highly targeted campaigns. The Congress party latched on to it much later. The power of Big Data in elections is not confined to India, in the United States, the 2012 Obama campaign famously used Big Data to revolutionize political campaigning.
Another significant aspect of Big Data’s role in the recent elections was sentiment analysis from social media feeds. Platforms like X, Facebook, and WhatsApp have become critical battlegrounds for shaping public opinion. By analysing the sentiment of millions of social media posts, political parties could gauge the public mood in real-time and adjust strategies dynamically. If a particular policy announcement generated negative reactions, swift corrective measures could be taken to mitigate any potential backlash. This ability to adapt on the fly is reminiscent of a chess grandmaster recalculating strategies several moves ahead after each opponent’s turn.
While this sounds great, the problem with how Big Data is used is that it’s not just political parties but pretty much any entity that can deploy it to manipulate behaviour and violate privacy. The Cambridge Analytica scandal is a cautionary tale, where personal data harvested from Facebook was used to influence the Brexit referendum and the 2016 US Presidential election. This highlighted how data, when mishandled, could undermine democratic processes.
This is why we need data protection laws. The good news is that a law is on its way. Much work has gone into the Digital Data Protection Bill (DPDP). Shwetashree Majumder, Managing Partner at Fidus Law Chambers, thinks it’s only a matter of time before it is implemented. “The DPDP Act was published in the Gazette of India after Presidential Assent on 11th August 2023. However, it is yet to come into force as the rules are yet to be notified and much of the Act is delegated to the rules.”
She adds, “The central government also has to appoint the chairperson and members of The Data Protection Board of India under the Act. The expectation was that this would be done by July 2024, but I suspect that it may get pushed by another month or two.”
However, people such as Venkatesh Hariharan, a Bengaluru-based public policy analyst, don’t sound gung-ho about the Bill. “With the DPDP Act, with AI and with Big Data, the key question is how well will the government protect an individual’s privacy. The individual is called a ‘Data Principal’ in the DPDP Act. If individuals have meaningful agency, choice and control over their data, the term becomes meaningful. However, if individuals do not have agency, then we are mere ‘Data Subjects,” he says.
Very simply put, a principal is someone who owns the data wholly while a subject is a person who does not have complete control over it. When asked to explain where his pessimism comes from, he says the government’s intent and ability to enforce laws are weak. He goes on to describe his pessimism, “Technology will keep evolving. But will the law keep pace as well? For example, on social media, so many women get rape threats, and there is so much hate speech, but zero enforcement.”
But hope, we must. If data is indeed the new oil, then it must be extracted like oil, refined, and used responsibly. Only then can it power the engines of democracy and development.",The challenges of Big Data

https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/2024/06/12/miss-jamaica-universe-finalist-hits-bullying-schools/,"Tara-Chande Giles (Photo: Instagram/Tara-Chande Giles)
When 18 year-old Tara-Chande Giles saw the recent videos of young females being bullied by their more aggressive peers she was crestfallen. But rather than retreat in despair, she is intent on speaking out against bullies.
A finalist in the Miss Jamaica Universe competition, she has decided to use her platform to launch a campaign against bullying and violence in school.
“I have first-hand experience with this situation so I know the impact it can cause on your mental health. It can lead to depression, suicidal thoughts, even suicide. We have an epidemic of anger and violence in our society, so this is a serious matter,” Giles said.
“We need to tackle this situation in schools and plant seeds of early intervention, so it can help to stop the violence in school and gang violence in later years,” Giles said.
The St Hilda’s past student believes that there is no knee-jerk solution to fix the bullying phenomenon.
“Sometimes the schools themselves are overburdened, administrators themselves cannot do enough, especially when faced with parents who are themselves difficult to deal with. The problem needs a multi-agency effort so I am proposing that the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education team up for an anti-bullying campaign, enlisting celebrities and entertainers,” she proposed.
In Jamaica, bullying is a prevalent problem. The latest data from a study conducted in 2015 shows that: six in 10 Jamaican students say they have been bullied at some point in their lives. Almost 30 per cent of students surveyed fear going to school because of bullying.
“We need some basics, like a helpline where students can call if they feel bullied, and we can ask social media influencers to lend their voices to the campaign,” the model-phlebotomist-entrepreneur said.
During the last few weeks, Giles has made stops at Northgate High School, and Ocho Rios Primary School, both in St Ann to talk about the impact of bullying.
“It is really heartbreaking. It makes me feel really bad. Hurt people hurt people. One of the things I have realised is that some of the bullies are being bullied at home. So this is played out on others in the school. Therefore, some of the bullies are victims as well,” the perky 18 year-old, who is the daughter of reggae artiste Semonie ‘Maroon Queen’ Giles, said.
She is looking forward to finals of the Miss Jamaica Universe contest in July. Until then, she believes that it is better to ‘light a candle than curse the darkness’.

On Tuesday morning, Senthamarai, 72, her daughter Kamatchi, 55, and their neighbour Selvarani, 16, fainted in the bathroom. While Senthamarai and Kamatchi died on the way to Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Research Institute, Selvarani died after being admitted to the hospital. Following the tragedy, the government had announced a compensation of ₹30 lakh to the kin of girl child and ₹20 lakh each to the family of the women. Holding the government responsible for the deaths, VCK workers and Left parties hit the streets on Wednesday. As workers of both the parties squatted on the main road, movement of vehicles was severely affected near Reddiyarpalayam. Traffic was diverted through Moolakulam area following the agitation which lasted for about 30 minutes. The protesters demanded a hike in the compensation and a government job for members of the family. They dispersed after police assured to take up their demands with the government. Bodies handed over The bodies of the victims were handed over to the relatives after conducting a post-mortem. A large number of people gathered at the residences of the deceased persons. The Health Department officials visited Pudhu Nagar and enquired with residents to find out whether they were facing any health issues. A camp was also conducted to screen people in the area. The government also declared a holiday for schools in the area for a day, said an official. STP inspectedA team of officials from the Public Works Department inspected the drainage system and Sewage Treatment Plant at Kanagan Eri. The inspection of STP was conducted following complaints from the residents of Pudhu Nagar that the STP was poorly maintained. “The field visit is part of the inquiry ordered by the government. There is no direct link between the functioning of STP and the tragedy that occurred. The bathrooms of the houses where the women and child fainted were directly connected to the manhole without having any interceptor chamber. The inquiry is still on,” the official said.

Rainfall has been below normal for the period June 1 to 15 in Kodagu and Chikkamagalur. As a result of the slackening of the monsoon Kodagu which is the catchment area for Cauvery and Chikkamagalur which is the source for Hemavathy, have slid into rainfall deficit districts. Kodagu received 146.44 mm of rainfall from June 1 till 15 which is 23 per cent below normal and Chikkamagalur received 88 mm of rainfall during the same period and which is also 23 per cent below normal. But Mysuru, Mandya and Chamarajanagar have received above normal rains during the fortnight. While Mysuru received 64.8 mm of rain between June 1 and 15 which is 40 per cent above normal, Mandya has received 72.9 mm or 85 per cent above normal. Chamarajanagar has received 76.5 mm of rain during the same period which is 106 per cent above normal, according to KSNDMC.Though there were concerns about the slackening of monsoon, authorities say these are still early days and the monsoon is expected to gather vigour in the days ahead. According to India Meteorological Department, the monsoon was weak over the State while the KSNDMC noted that the rainfall distribution across the State was “isolated”. This is because only 6 per cent of the rain gauge stations installed at Gram Panchayats have recorded rainfall in excess of 2.5 mm during the 24-hour period ending 8.30 a.m. on Sunday. Rainfall was described as isolated in Kodagu, Hassan, Mysuru, and Ramanagara while Chamarajanagar and Mandya were categorised as Dry by the KSNDMC.The KSNDMC described Dry as when no rain gauge station reports any rain and it is isolated if 25 per cent of the rain guage stations record a rainfall of more than 2.5 mm likewise widespread is defined when more than 76 per cent of the rain gauge stations record a rainfall of more than 2.5 mm. Mysuru received 0.1 mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Sunday against a normal of 2.7 mm while Ramanagar also recorded 0.1 mm of rains against a normal of 1.5 mm. There were no rains in Mandya and Chamarajanagar during the same period.","Monsoon slackens in Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru"

It is simply hot milk poured over sweet paalkova, and served. The drink has caught the fancy of the people of Coimbatore, gaining popularity in the recent times. The hot and sweet beverage is now suggested as a must-try when one visits Coimbatore.Vadivel Kumar, who makes paalkova milk in the R S Puram parlour says that the drink has been around for decades. Their inspiration? Travellers who regularly asked for hot milk and paalkova, and enjoyed having them together at Aavin’s milk booth at the railway station. “We noticed people enjoying this combination often, which made us think: why not create a drink with these two ingredients?” he adds. He remembers that in their initial years, the drink was sweeter than the current version. It was tweaked over the years to suit the taste of consumers.

Paalkova milk is available at all the five Union-owned parlours of Aavin milk in Coimbatore. Booths that do not come under the union make the drink according to demand. Locals and outsiders alike have taken a liking to this drink and are excited to make new additions. “People create their variations. Some customers ask us to add badam powder to the drink,“ says one of the workers.So, why is the beverage made only in the city? The answer lies in Coimbatore’s weather. It influences the consistency and the colour of the sweet and workers say that paalkova made in Coimbatore blends well with hot milk.Available at RS Puram and other Union-owned Aavin milk outlets

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) plans to move the cab pick-up point permanently to the multilevel car park soon. Currently, it has been sending batches of passengers to the parking lot for cab pick-ups on a trial basis. This has not gone down well with passengers, and many of them say it is particularly difficult to walk from the Terminal 4 (T4) of the domestic airport to the parking lot while carrying heavy luggage. Satish Galley, a passenger, said he was disappointed that he and his wife had to take a tiring walk from T4 to the multilevel car park. “The worst part is, on both occasions when we went, the lift was not working. My wife, who was sick, struggled to push the baggage trolley all the way,” he added. Vasanthi Kannan, a senior citizen and an air passenger who returned to the city recently, said she and her husband struggled to push the trolley up the ramp of the walkway and reach the multilevel car park to catch a cab. “When my niece arrived in the airport too, the elevator in the parking lot was not functional,” she added. Vidyasagar Jagadeesan, a frequent flyer, said another inconvenience of going to the multilevel car park was that the walkway was not completely covered by a roof. “Chennai is already experiencing sporadic rain. Since some areas of the walkway is not roofed, passengers can get drenched. I experienced this on Friday night. Ideally, they should implement any system only after taking into consideration all issues and addressing them,” he added. AAI officials said they were slowly moving passengers to take cabs from the multilevel car park. They said a majority of the people arriving at the airport get picked up by their personal vehicles, and these were allowed in front of the terminal. Only the cab pick-up point has been shifted to the multilevel car park, they add. “We have created a huge facility, so it is only natural that we make use of it. The multilevel car park has been built for both parking and cab pick-ups. For now, some of the passengers are being sent to the parking area. Very soon, all passengers will have to take their cabs from there. This is not the case in just Chennai. If you look at other privately-managed airports in India, they are following the same rule. But we will ensure there is roofing over the entire walkway so passengers are able to reach to the pick-up point without any hassle,” an official said.  Also, they are in the process of adding more buggies to transport passengers from the terminals to the parking lot, he added. ",Cab pick-up point’s shifting to multilevel car park irks air passengers

A Saunders’s Tern was spotted at Geeta Nagar. (Yash Kothiala)
Under normal circumstances, getting a glimpse of these avians would require a boat ride 60 to 70km into the sea and an ounce of good luck. But thanks to the stormy weather and heavy rains, the birds were being swept towards land by the strong winds and delivered to Mumbai’s doorstep.
“Our group of 13 was one of the 10-15 groups of birders that went on a bird-watching hop on Sunday,” said Aseem Kothiala, a Santacruz resident who woke up at 5 am that day. “By 7 am, we had reached the Radio Club Jetty [in Colaba], from where we went to Sassoon Docks, Geeta Nagar, and then back, bird watching till 3 pm.”
Kothiala is part of a WhatsApp group of 400 bird enthusiasts, of which 250-300 are from the Mumbai-Thane region. When the news broke, nearly 100 people tried their luck almost immediately, with no intention of missing their chance at the rare sighting.
“While other birder communities might try to hide details of their sightings and keep them exclusive, the Mumbai birder spirit is different,” said Rakesh Dhareshwar, a Goa resident in the group. “People shared live sightings of the birds they’d seen along with the location so others could join them. The energy was so infectious that even I tried my luck, spotting a Great Frigatebird for the first time in the recorded history of Goa.”
According to Dhareshwar, pelagic birds—like Lesser Noddy, Brown Noddy, Lesser Frigatebird, Bridled Tern, Saunders’s Tern, and Masked Booby — are uncommon though not unexpected visitors to the Indian coast.
“There are always a few sightings in the monsoon. But this time, due to the weeks of continuous stormy weather, which means the winds across the ocean are even rougher, it is probable that more of them have reached the shore. In the excitement, there are also more eyes on the birds,” he said.
Pelagic birds are seen sporadically along the western coast of India, from Gujarat to Kerala, said Sunjoy Monga, an ornithologist. “For a few months in a year, they breed on far-off islands spread across. Some species seen in the Indian Ocean include the Noddys, Terns, Squa, Frigatebirds, and Boobys, among others.”
Some extreme bird enthusiasts also flew in from Delhi for the weekend pelagic watch, with more from other parts of the country on their way. “Twitchers, a type of birder, work on growing the list of bird species they have spotted,” said Kothiala, explaining the craze.
At their first spot, the Radio Club Jetty, Kothiala and gang spotted their first Pelagic bird of the day: a Bridled Tern. They then moved along, by 9 am, to Sassoon Docks, where they spotted a Lesser Frigatebird. Onto Geeta Nagar next, they came across a Saunder’s Tern. For the entire group, all these birds were “lifers”, meaning they had spotted them for the first time. Kothalia’s own bird count on spotting the three new species jumped from 1,003 to 1,006.
Others like him flaunted their lifer sightings online, with many posting on the ‘Share your bird lifers from India’ Facebook group. “What more can I ask for,” said one of the comments after coming across a squinty-eyed Lesser Noddy at the Sassoon Docks. One Arctic Skua was also reportedly seen at the Gateway of India in early July.
The flock of bird enthusiasts was also apparent on the eBird list of rare bird sightings in the past seven days: at least 60 Lesser Frigatebirds, 30 Lesser Noddy, 50 Bridled Tern, and 50 Saunder’s Tern sightings were reported in Mumbai, confirmed and unconfirmed. eBird is an online platform for birders to maintain records of their sightings.
As per Kothiala, there are 25-30 Bridled Terns, 4-5 Saunder’s Terns, 2-3 lesser Frigatebirds on Mumbai’s coast, with an additional 4-5 Lesser Noddy birds at Elephanta Caves. “One Brown Noddy was also spotted at Elephanta Caves, but he was dead,” Kothiala added.
As Mumbai does not feature in the bird’s charted flight path—for mating, the birds prefer deserted islands with scarce humans and other bird species—the birds landing upon the shores are stranded.
“Fighting the heavy winds is taxing for the birds, especially the older and younger ones. Many a time, they are found dehydrated and exhausted, and sometimes injured,” said Pawan Sharma from Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare or RAWW, an NGO that rescues birds and other wildlife. “In some cases, the birds just need a safe passage so they can rest till the winds die down and the time is right to fly back.”
Not all are that lucky, though. Sharma said a Masked Booby was found on Gorai beach, the search for which is still on. Two Lesser Noddys found in Navi Mumbai died, one of which HT had reported about on July 16, despite being rescued by the NGO Wildlife Welfare Association (WWA).
However, the birds spotted by Kothiala were in generally good condition, possibly because of the advantages offered by Mumbai, with many boat resting spots nearby.
“The Saunder’s Tern seemed the most tired of them all and was resting on rocks, flying occasionally and then returning, as though it was recuperating. The rest were in great condition,” said Kothiala, who has already made plans to bird-watch again this weekend.","Pelagic birds land up on Mumbai’s shores, catch fancy of birders"

DG PID IramTanweer, the keynote speaker, emphasized the need to close the gap between policymakers and the public.
She acknowledged social media’s role in spreading information but stressed the importance of combating fake news through proactive government measures and responsible media practices. “To address the challenges posed by misinformation, the government must be swift in presenting counter-narratives,” she asserted, while also advocating for increased media literacy and youth engagement.
Sidra Azhar Dar highlighted social media’s effectiveness during crises, citing the 2022 floods as an example where social media amplified the voices of affected individuals. She warned against imposing restrictions on social media and the internet, as such measures could further alienate citizens from the state.
Qasim Farooq provided an analysis of social media trends, explaining their influence on public opinion and their role in driving social and economic changes. Professor MaheDarakshan stressed the importance of integrating youth perspectives into policymaking to ensure that policies are inclusive and impactful.
The session concluded with a consensus among the panelists on the need for ongoing dialogue and events to address media-related challenges and promote strategic reforms.","RFI, PID host session on media’s role in social, economic stability"

The former MP also remarks on the prominent position of the Lingayat leaders in the saffron party. In the clip, the veracity of which DH has been unable to verify independently, Simha is also seen expressing disappointment with incumbent Mysore-Kodagu MP Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, and Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, of having kept him in the dark about the erstwhile Mysuru royal family scion’s plans to contest the Lok Sabha elections. Simha pointed out that the reversal of his fortunes in the BJP was illustrative of the problem faced by Vokkaliga leaders in the party. Notwithstanding his record as an MP, and his popularity, he was not given the party ticket for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Simha said. Attributing the denial to a ploy by a section of leaders, who played the ‘OBC’ card, to ensure Yaduveer was named the BJP candidate, Simha said, “I don’t think this can ever happen in the Lingayat-dominated seats such as Haveri, Belagavi, Shivamogga, where Lingayat leaders contest. It can only happen in a seat where a popular young and emerging Vokkaliga leader was contesting.” However, Simha refrained from naming any leader of the party apart from Yaduveer.",Video of Simha questioning BJP’s treatment of Vokkaligas goes viral

A Brigadier-led team from the Western Command left for Dekwala, a hamlet located just outside of Rupanagar, to visit the centenarian.
Upon arrival, the Brigadier and his accompanying entourage met Charan Singh, who is still fit enough to manoeuvre around a house even if it requires a walking stick. Having joined the Royal British Indian Army as an 18-year-old Lance Naik, he served in World War 2 and was posted in Malay (now Malaysia), Kranji in Singapore of the South-East Asian theatre.
He has vivid recollections of the war, fellow troopers and the enemy. It helps that Singh chose to arm himself with a camera in his youth itself. He was among the rare few who chronicled their time in the war through photographs, many of which he still turns to whenever memory fails him.
Today, Charan Singh, who later served in the Indian Army with postings in Lahore and Yol, leads a simple village life and refuses to be a burden on anyone. On being asked about his health secret, he quips: “Keeping things simple goes a long way.”
The army’s wishes were accompanied by a birthday cake and felicitation messages. “#OurVeteransOurPride #WesternCommand honours L/Nk Charan Singh (Retd),on his #100th Birthday.

Charan Singh enjoys spending time with his grandchildren. Simply sitting around a bonfire, recollecting stories from the olden days, still brings him joy. “These pictures help me remember my youth, the travel, my entire life and pass whatever knowledge I have onto my children and grandchildren,” he says, before urging the youth to first pay attention to their health so they can turn into upstanding members of society.",WW2 veteran from Punjab recalls century of snapshots on 100th birthday

Haryana chief minister (CM) Nayab Singh Saini was apprised that Samadhan Shivirs are being organised at all 88 municipalities daily for two hours in the morning. (PTI)
Reviewing the various projects being executed by the urban local bodies department, the CM said that making Gurugram a smart city tops the state government’s priority list.
“Officers should expedite works related to cleanliness in Gurugram. Civic bodies doing good work in the swachhata campaign will be honoured,” Saini said in the meeting that was attended by district municipal commissioners (DMC) and municipal commissioners (MCs). Urban local bodies minister Vipul Goel was also present in the meeting.
The CM said that any agency mishandling drainage cleaning work should be blacklisted. Saini said road repair and re-carpeting works should be expedited.
“The grievance of every complainant should be resolved on a priority basis in the Samadhan Shivirs,” said Saini.
During the meeting, the CM was apprised that Samadhan Shivirs are being organised at all 88 municipalities daily for two hours in the morning.
Saini directed the officers to clear the pendency related to property IDs at the earliest. He said that a district-wise road map should be prepared to complete the pendency work and removing the discrepancies, if any.
Stray cattle & Svamita yojana
The chief minister urged people not to abandon cattle and directed officials to ensure timely relocation of stray cattle in gaushalas and nandishalas. He added that the state government has a separate budget for gaushalas and nandishalas. “People abandoning their cattle should be identified and punished as per the law,” he said.
Reviewing the Svamita yojana, a central scheme to provide a ‘Record of Rights’ to village household owners, the CM directed the officers concerned to ensure that by November 30, the pendency of the Svamita cards should be zero. He said that the officers should fix a day to distribute Svamita cards in Samadhan Shivirs.",Making Gurugram a smart city priority: Nayab Singh Saini

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/02/spain-apocalyptic-floods-climate-crisis-worse-big-oil-cop29,"Move on. Nothing to see here. Just another ordinary, everyday apocalypse.
If past experience is any guide, the world’s reaction to the floods in Spain last week will be similar to that of motorway drivers at a crash scene: slow down, take in the horror, outwardly express sympathy, inwardly give thanks that fate picked someone else – and foot on the accelerator.
That is the pattern in our climate-disrupted era when extreme-weather catastrophes have become so commonplace that they risk being normalised. Instead of outrage and determination to reduce the dangers, there is an insidious sense of complacency: these things happen. Someone else is responsible. Somebody else will fix it.
Nothing could be further from the truth. The unnatural disaster in Spain – Europe’s deadliest flash floods in at least half a century – is evidence of two undeniable truths: the human-caused climate crisis is just starting to pick up ferocity, and we need to quickly kill the fossil fuel industry before it kills us.
That should be the primary message at the UN Cop29 climate summit that opens in Baku next week because halting the combustion of gas, oil, coal and trees is the only way to stabilise the climate. For this to happen, we must fight the tendency to normalise scenes of disaster.
Cars skittled like bowling pins in urban streets, cars bobbing in rivers of mud, cars turning into death traps. The images from Valencia and other regions of Spain are both shocking and familiar. In Italy last month, vehicles were swept away as roads turned to rivers. Before that, it was the turn of France, and in September, central Europe, where 24 died in floods in Poland, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. There have also been freakish downpours in England.
Of course, there have always been floods, while local factors – atmospheric, geographic, economic and political – contribute to the impact, but it is the global physics of a fossil fuel-destabilised world that is loading the dice towards disaster. The warmer the atmosphere gets, the more moisture it can hold. That means longer droughts and more intense downpours. In Spain, a year’s worth of rain was dumped in less than half a day.
“Events of this type, which used to occur many decades apart, are now becoming more frequent and their destructive capacity is greater,” said Dr Ernesto Rodríguez Camino, a senior state meteorologist and member of the Spanish Meteorological Association.
Nobody can say they were not warned. Thirty-two years have passed since governments agreed to tackle climate concerns at the first Rio de Janeiro Earth summit and nine years since the Paris Agreement to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Yet global temperatures continue to hit record highs and emissions are rising faster than the average for the past decade. In other words, the foot is still on the gas although the pile-ups are getting so close they are almost banal.
Governments continue to focus on economic speed rather than climate safety. They have been slow to reduce the risks and prepare societies, but many, including the UK, have been quick to lock up those who scream warnings and who hold up traffic. The legal system is effectively compelling citizens to accept catastrophe.
What else to call it? In recent years, apocalyptic images appear to have migrated from Hollywood disaster movies: Commuters swept off subway platforms or trapped in carriages as the waters rose up to their necks during the Zhengzhou metro line 5 flooding disaster in China , the glass wall being ripped off the side of a Vietnamese office tower during the super-typhoon Yagi, which also snapped giant wind turbines like twigs in Hainan, China. Each grotesque clip deadens the impact.
We are living in a time of unwelcome climate superlatives: the hottest two years in the world’s recorded history, the deadliest fire in the US, the biggest fire in Europe, the biggest fire in Canada, the worst drought in the Amazon rainforest. The list goes on. This is just the start. As long as people pump gases into the atmosphere, such records will be broken with increasing frequency until “worst ever” becomes our default expectation. But we should not let our baselines shift so easily. These are not isolated cases. They are part of a disturbing pattern that has been predicted by scientists and the UN. The cause is clear and so is the remedy.

The scientists at World Weather Attribution have shown on a case-by-case basis how much more intense and likely storms, droughts, floods and fires have become as a result of human-caused climate disruption. This includes the late summer flooding in the Sudan, Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon that killed more than 2,000 people and displaced millions, the torrents that left at least 244 dead in Nepal from 26-28 September, the floods in the south of Brazil that took more than 169 lives earlier in the year, as well as the devastating hurricanes - particularly Helene and Milton – in the US that killed 360 people and caused more than $100bn of damage. In every case, the poor and elderly are most vulnerable. In Spain too, many of the bodies that filled the mobile morgues are of those of old people unable to escape first floor homes and delivery drivers caught in the torrents that deluged the streets.

That all of this is already happening with just 1.3C of global heating should be an urgent warning to slash emissions, said the authors of these studies.
“At COP29 global leaders really need to agree to not only reduce, but stop burning fossil fuels, with an end date. The longer the world delays replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy, the more severe and frequent extreme weather events will become,” said Friederike Otto, Lead of World Weather Attribution at the Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London.
The UN seems to be running out of vocabulary to describe how serious the danger is. UN secretary-general António Guterres has declared “code red for humanity”. UN executive climate secretary Simon Stiell has warned “we have two years to save the world.” And last week the head of the UN environment programme, Inger Andersen, insisted “It’s climate crunch time for real.”
Yet the agenda is being set by those who want to expand fossil fuel production. Azerbaijan is the third Cop host in a row, after the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, that plans to increase oil and gas production. Next year’s host Brazil also intends to boost output. So do many of the world’s richest nations This year’s talks will address how to finance a “transition away from oil and gas” – the vague goal finally accepted at Cop last year after three decades of talks.
The dissonance between this sluggish response and the apocalyptic scenes in Spain and elsewhere should be a jolt to the global consciousness. After all, the original meaning of apocalypse is revelation – lifting the cover off, laying things bare. But for that to happen, we need to truly take in and respond to the horror of what the world is going through, and stop pretending we can carry on as usual.",Spain’s apocalyptic floods show two undeniable truths: the climate crisis is getting worse and Big Oil is killing us

Manifesto of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena was released at MIG Club, Bandra in the presence of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena President Raj Thackeray in Mumbai, HT Photo
“Many have merely said what they will do in their manifesto. We have released one specifying what we will do and how we will implement it,” MNS chief Raj Thackeray said at a press conference. Though the MNS is not officially part of the Mahayuti, it has a tacit understanding with the alliance on a few seats and Thackeray has already announced that the next chief minister will be from the BJP and he will be part of the new government.
“When the question of joining the new government comes, I will ask the party in power on how they can implement our manifesto,” Thackeray said while releasing the manifesto, which says that there is too much casteism in the state due to politics and there is a need for social bonding.
The manifesto promises good education, childcare, employment, basic needs, good shelter and food. It also addresses solid waste management, open spaces, sewage treatment, environment and bio-diversity, industrial and commercial policy. It harps on Marathi asmita (pride), use of Marathi in all spheres, conservation of forts and promotion of traditional sports.
When asked about promises and freebies offered by Congress, NCP (SP), Shiv Sena (UBT), BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP, Raj Thackeray said promises need to be made taking finances into account.
“ I am not unhappy if women get money. If the state can bear the financial burden (of the Ladki Bahin scheme), then it is a gift and if it can’t, then I can say it’s a bribe,’’ he said.
When asked about Shiv Sena (UBT)’s promise of constructing a Shivaji temple in every tehsil, Raj Thackeray said there was no need for it and what was needed more instead was educational institutions
Meanwhile, Raj Thackeray has decided to cancel his rally at Shivaji Park on Sunday, the death anniversary of Bal Thackeray, as he has not received permission for the same. Shiv Sena (UBT) too had sought permission for a rally at Shivaji Park on Sunday and party workers will gather at the venue to pay homage to the founder.","No freebies, sops in MNS manifesto"

The judge said, a self financing institution, which does not receive any government aid, would not fall under the definition of the term ‘State’  in order to provide equality of opportunity in public employment.He said that a self financing college established with temple funds and whose recurring expenses were met with fees collected from students would not fall under Articles 16(1) and (2) of the Constitution which prohibits discrimination in public employment on grounds religion. It would instead fall under Article 16(5) which permits appointment based on religion in certain denominational institutions, he added.The judge, further, highlighted that Section 10 of the HR and CE Act insists that any officer or servant appointed to carry out the purpose of the Act must be a person profession Hindu religion. He rejected the argument of the writ petitioner’s counsel that a college, though established with temple funds, could be considered only as an educational institution and not a religious institution and therefore Articles 16(1) and (2) would apply.
