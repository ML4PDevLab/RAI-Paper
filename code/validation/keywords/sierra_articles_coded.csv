Zimbabwe,7363,herald.co.zw,2017-01-12T00:05:09Z,"Zimbabwe to see 3,8pc growth: World Bank","Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa
The World Bank has painted a more optimistic picture in respect of Zimbabwe’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth this year, projecting it at 3,8 percent.
This is higher than the 1,7 percent GDP growth projection enunciated in the 2017 National Budget by Finance and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa last month, which however, had not factored in December economic data.
According to the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report titled “Weak Investment in Uncertain Times”, which was released yesterday, the Zimbabwean economy will also grow by 3,4 percent next year, as well as in 2019.
The Bretton-Woods institution’s 2017 forecast for Zimbabwe also exceeds the projected growth estimate for Sub-Saharan Africa, which has been put at 2,9 percent.
Last year, the local economy faced a number of challenges including tight liquidity, drought and low foreign direct investment (FDI), but some of the factors are intricately tied to the state of the broader global economy, especially as low commodity prices (for example) prevailed throughout the course of 2016.
The World Bank estimates that the Zimbabwean economy grew by 0,4 percent in 2016, close to the 0,6 percent growth rate projected by Minister Chinamasa in December.
It has, however, warned that economic growth in the country and generally in the region could be lower than estimated due to prevailing vulnerabilities in the global economy:
“Commodity prices are expected to stabilise, but stay well below their levels of 2011, and fiscal adjustment needs remain large. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. They include heightened policy uncertainty in the United States and Europe, slower improvements in commodity prices, and tighter global financing conditions.
“Domestically (sub-Saharan Africa), policy makers may not enact the reforms needed to rebuild fiscal buffers. Addressing fiscal vulnerabilities, and bolstering per capita growth remain key policy challenges across the region,” said the World Bank.
At the broader level, global growth for 2017 has been projected at 2,7 percent on the back of anticipated gains in emerging and developing economies.
“Growth in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) is expected to pick up in 2017, reflecting receding obstacles to activity in commodity exporters and continued solid domestic demand in commodity importers.
“Weak investment and productivity growth are, however, weighing on medium-term prospects across many EMDEs. Downside risks to global growth include increasing policy uncertainty in major advanced economies and some EMDEs, financial market disruptions, and weakening potential growth,” said the World Bank.
“However, fiscal stimulus in key major economies — in particular, the United States — could lead to stronger-than-expected activity in the near term and thus represent a substantial upside risk to the outlook.” — BH24.",0,,,"{'None': ['Africa', 'Europe'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'USA': ['United States']}",-999,[],[],[],['China']
Zimbabwe,2109,zimbabwesituation.com,2014-03-05T15:21:20Z,"Zimbabwe limits term for public executives, bans perm secs from boards","Government has banned heads of public enterprises from holding office for more than eight years, and bureaucrats from sitting on boards of such companies in a bid to improve corporate governance.
“Mr Speaker, Sir, with regards to the chief executive officers appointment and performance, cabinet has decided that CEOs and other senior management in state enterprises, parastatals and heads of local authorities be put on performance contracts,” finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa told Parliament on Tuesday.
Corporate governance at state-owned companies has come under spotlight in recent months after disclosures of executive compensation at several institutions showing that some earn monthly salaries running into hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Many are riddled with debts, corruption and mismanagement with some executives staying on for more than 20 years.
Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa, who is also the as chairman for the cabinet committee on parastatals, state enterprises and local authorities said the executive had adopted a new corporate governance framework to effectively manage government entities.
“CEOs should enter into four-year employment contracts which may be renewable once. The contracts should clearly spell out the minimum requirements, which if not met, should constitute grounds for termination of service,” he said.
The boards will now be required to evaluate the performance of the chief executive on a quarterly basis and appraise the responsible minister.
Interviews for prospective heads of public companies will now be carried out by the board and a professional human resources company.
Permanent secretaries would now be banned from holding positions on the boards of such companies.
“No permanent secretary should be a member of a public enterprise board, but that ministers should appoint appropriately qualified and experienced persons from their ministries to sit through deliberations of the board and to report to the ministry the gist of the board’s deliberations,” Chinamasa said.
CEOs will also be required to report directly to the permanent secretary on a regular basis including all significant decisions taken by management.
The finance minister said the new measures will also bar executives from serving on more than two boards of public enterprises. The new framework also compels state enterprises and parastatals to hold annual general meetings, which should be attended by representatives from the office of the president and cabinet, treasury, the parent ministry, the auditor and comptroller general and other stakeholder ministries.
He said the cabinet committee on state enterprises and parastatals development will oversee the forensic audit of all parastatals and local authorities.
“Subsequent measures will be taken to deal with the more complex issues of salaries, allowances and procurement practices of public enterprises and local authorities,” Chinamasa said.",0,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'RUS': ['Perm']}",-999,[],[],[],['China']
Zimbabwe,13487,theindependent.co.zw,2022-04-01T06:30:32Z,Doubt lingers over govt’s capacity to sustain Chinese health upgrades,"Miriam Mangwaya
DESPITE the bad-investor tag, some Chinese entities ploughed half a million dollars to upgrade one of the country’s referral hospitals to fight Covid-19 in early 2020, but it is uncertain if the government will be able to sustain the gains.
It started with the death of a 30 year-old local broadcast journalist, Zororo Makamba, who became Zimbabwe’s second confirmed Covid-19 case and passed away on March 23 of the same year, two weeks after his return from New York. His death, which came with course-changing developments, was officially recorded as the first, as Covid-19 hit Zimbabwe.
Death trap
The Makamba family was bitter with the way in which Zororo was treated and believed that his death could have been avoided. In a statement issued immediately after Zororo’s death, the Makamba family directed its anger at Wilkins Infectious Diseases Hospital and the government for being ill-prepared to deal with Covid-19.
Wilkins was a death front because it had no ventilators, oxygen, running water or drugs, charged the family.
Nurses and doctors had no protective clothing, it took too long for the hospital staff to admit Zororo, and the available medical staff was not readily accessible.
When a ventilator was finally brought in to attend to the journalist, no-one had the slightest idea how to use it. The Zimbabwean public health infrastructure was already run down. Worker protests were frequent due to poor working conditions, there was a severe shortage of drugs in all public health centres that were understaffed and patients were being sent back home to die.
Three Chinese investors based in Zimbabwe quickly stepped in to upgrade Wilkins Infectious Diseases Hospital, a municipality-run facility that subsequently became the first and biggest Covid-19 isolation and referral centre.
Enter the dragon
Two mining outfits — Jin An Corporation and China Africa Min Chang Ming Corporation — as having combined resources with the multi-million tile maker, Sunny Yi Feng, and poured in US$500 000 to upgrade the troubled health centre.
But the companies would not reveal how much each of them contributed towards the upgrade of Wilkins, nor the exact sources of the funds. Their project focused mainly on the two expansive ward wings at the hospital’s isolation centre — it was discovered during tours and interviews — to cater for Covid-19 cases only. Due to Chinese investors’ bad-boy reputation, the investment at Wilkins generated mixed reactions. Cynics regarded it with suspicion while the government hailed it as ample evidence of Chinese goodwill. At that time, Sunny Yi Feng was already in a storm as reports of widespread labour rights abuses trickled in. A year after — in 2021 — the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions released a lengthy dossier of rights abuses at the firm. Media coverage of the Wilkins refurbishment project was polarised, too, resulting in ad hoc and sometimes unbalanced and scant reporting on the Chinese intervention.
A throw-back probe done in collaboration with Information for Development Trust, a non-profit organisation supporting investigative journalism in Zimbabwe and southern Africa, showed that the Chinese intervention had changed the game at Wilkins as the country was just waking up to the horrors of Covid-19. Wilkins, formerly the European Infectious Disease Hospital, was inherited by the Harare City Council after independence in 1980 to cater for infectious ailments. The health centre has no defined catchment area, which means it draws patients from all over the capital — with more than 1,5 million people — and areas beyond. Before the renovations by the three Chinese companies, Wilkins was fast turning into a desolate and gaunt complex.
Improved
Hospital staff are quick to hail the renovations that were made from materials mostly imported from China; Chinese workers also provided labour. The head of the nursing staff, Priscilla Luwizhi, described the upgrade as a life saver.
“After the renovations, we were able to offer expanded services for Covid-19 treatment,” Luwizhi said.
Nurses and doctors were threatening to leave for other pastures, she added, because they were exposed to infectious disease due to lack of protective materials, requisite equipment and drugs as well the deterioration of the buildings and acutely poor working conditions.
“We thought we would lose nurses, who did not want to die from the virus, but thanks to the government-Chinese partnership, we retained them.
“The renovations beautified the area and created an environment that pacified the nurses amidst the psychological trauma they were suffering. Seeing how beautiful the place is now, who would not want to work here?” added the chief nurse.
Before the 23-day renovation cycle started, Wilkins had 35 beds in the two ward wings. But demand for beds was increasing and Wilkins was finding it hard to cope as coronavirus cases surged in a short space of time. Twenty-five beds were quickly added, with 10 reserved for the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), interviews with staff and the investors revealed.
The wards have been transformed into state-of-the-art nursing facilities, complete with television sets that the head nurse said relieved patients’ stress.
The ablution facilities that had become run-down and were constantly getting clogged also received a facelift, it was established during the tours made to the hospital.
Some of the ablution facilities before renovation and potable water is now in constant supply. Potable water is now constantly available. To ensure uninterrupted power supply, the Chinese investors also installed a powerful back-up generator.
An industrial tank was set up within the hospital premises to provide piped oxygen to the wards, in addition to the installation of two ventilators. This enabled Wilkins to replace the gas cylinders that the nurses who were interviewed agreed posed serious accident risks. One of the isolation ward wings after renovation. One of the hospital nurses, Fadzai Jamare (30), said the renovations and supply of equipment were a morale booster.
“After the renovations, the environment is now conducive for us to do our work properly and safely,” she said.
“We also received modern equipment necessary for Covid -19 treatment. Of interest is the CCTV which enables us to constantly monitor patients who are in isolation, while we avoiding frequent contact with them. We, however, need piped oxygen in all hospital wards and also for some of the rooms that have not been fully-equipped,” she added.
Covid-19 in-patients like Elvis Dube (not his real name) are happy with the renovation results.
“Service delivery from the nurses is excellent and, in the wards, the general outlook is comfortable.”
Jin An Corporation managing director, David Zhou Jin, said all the money came from the Chinese investors and none from the Zimbabwean government.
“The renovations that we did were close to starting the construction from scratch. No company was forced to donate towards the refurbishments. The renovations also created employment for at least 60 locals,” he said.
“We were afraid more people could lose their lives if we did not help the government of Zimbabwe improve access to health services.”
Foreign relations, humanitarian aid
And the decision to give health support to Wilkins reflects amply on the foreign relations between Beijing and Harare. It also underlies a deliberate plan to boost opportunities for Chinese investors. Cheng Guo Feng, the Sunny Yifeng Investment Corporation managing director, said the hospital upgrade was meant to strengthen the ties between China and Zimbabwe.
“The donations were in support of President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s decision to welcome foreign investors. They were meant to strengthen China-Zimbabwe bilateral relations,” Guo Feng said.
“Besides, the Covid-19 pandemic is affecting everyone, regardless of nationality. Therefore, we saw it prudent to improve the health service locally since we are staying in Zimbabwe where we are investing. Having operated in Zimbabwe for over four years, we have seen that the country is ideal for investment.”
The Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs portfolio was speaking the same language, saying the Sino-Zimbabwe relations had been migrated from “all-weather friends” to “comprehensive strategic partnerships” since President Emmerson Mnangagwa took over from the late Robert Mugabe with military help in 2017.
“Relations between Zimbabwe and China continue to grow from strength to strength each year,” Foreign Affairs minister Fredrick Shava said.
“It is also worth noting that China has remained a strategic partner in the health sector through donation of vaccines,” he added.
There was an ongoing partnership between Zimbabwe’s biggest public health centre — Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in Harare — and China’s Human Provincial Hospital, revealed the minister.
“The Chinese business community through the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe have also donated PPEs and other medical supplies to the government to assist national efforts in combating the Covid-19 pandemic,” Shava said.
For Leo Wang, Sunny Yi Feng public relation manager, Chinese companies ought to ‘give back to the community’ in Zimbabwe.
“Where we can help, we will offer assistance, not only in the health sector but in very other sector where there is need,” Wang said.
Independent health associations like the Community Working Group on Health, warned against overdependence on Chinese aid, though, amid fears that the government may not be able to sustain the improvements made at Wilkins. Hospital staff indicated that there was need to add more equipment, oxygen supplies and general improvement of the hospital.
Promises and claims
But there is no evidence yet that the government and the Harare municipality have moblised funds to continue with needed upgrades at the referral hospital, in spite of the hanging claims of supporting the hospital. The Health ministry secretary, Jasper Chimedza, insisted that government had ploughed in more money for further renovations than what the Chinese investors had done in the first place.
“We have availed money for renovations at Wilkins way more than the Chinese business people injected,” Chimedza said.
But he would not say how much, nor what renovations the money was being used on.
There were no signs of major upgrades after the Chinese donations when visits were made to Wilkins in recent months during this investigation.
Chimedza evaded the question on whether or not the government-sponsored renovations had already commenced.
The Wilkins administrator, Andrew Tapera, also insisted—without giving figures — that the government had provided funds for the installation of piped oxygen in “some wards”.

Zimbabwe,11550,zimbabwesituation.com,2020-04-17T00:05:25Z,Air Zimbabwe Flies Boeing 777 To Maintenance After 3 Months On The Ground,"Air Zimbabwe’s Boeing 777 has finally taken its first flight for the airline. Received in January, the Boeing widebody had sat on the ground in Harare since then. However, yesterday’s flight was not the beginning of a new long haul future for Air Zimbabwe. Instead, the 777 has flown to Addis Ababa for maintenance, possibly in preparation for an impending lease.
Air Zimbabwe’s unused 777
It was back in January when Air Zimbabwe celebrated the arrival of its Boeing 777 at the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport in Harare. Coming from Malaysia Airlines, the 777-200 was not a particularly new or particularly unique aircraft, but for Air Zimbabwe, it held great significance.
ZimLive @zimlive #UPDATE Air Zimbabwe has taken delivery of a Boeing 777-200 bought for US$16.5m from Malaysia Airlines in 2016. The now 15-year-old plane, initially acquired by the ill-fated Zimbabwe Airways, will see the flag carrier revive its London and Beijing routes
This delivery, the first of two aircraft destined for the carrier, was a signal that the government was freshly committed to the future of the state-owned airline. Acting President Constantino Chiwenga even said at the time,
“Receipt of this Boeing 777 aircraft is clear testimony that we are taking concrete steps to capacitate our national airline so that it plays a role in promoting economic growth, creating jobs and facilitating international trade and tourism.”
Concrete steps maybe, but the plane itself may as well have been made out of concrete for all the activity its seen. Since January, it has flown precisely zero times. That was, until yesterday.
Flying off to Addis
Yesterday, Z-RGM, the 15-year-old pride, and joy of Air Zimbabwe took off from Harare at around 11:38 local time. It flew for just under four hours before touching down in Ethiopia at Addis Ababa.
The aircraft was piloted not by a Zimbabwean aviator, but by a German chap by the name of Werner Heumann. He had arrived into Harare on Monday on board an Ethiopian Airlines repatriation flight. That in itself was somewhat controversial, not because he wasn’t a local, but because the locals on the trips, returning from the US and UK mostly, had to enter a 14-day quarantine on arrival. Heumann and a Swiss national on the flight did not.
Regardless of the strange piloting situation, where was the 777 going, and would it be coming back? Air Zimbabwe released a press statement regarding the movement on Twitter.
Air Zimbabwe @FlyAirZimbabwe ***Update on B777-200ER (Z-RGM)***
The airline’s explanation suggests that the 777 is undergoing maintenance. Ethiopian Airlines has a substantial MRO base in Addis, so that’s a plausible explanation. However, the likelihood of it ever returning to Zimbabwean soil is rather remote.
Never to return?
Air Zimbabwe has been mulling leasing this aircraft out for some time. Despite the government making the right noises about the airline back in January, it appears their commitment to a robust national airline remains shaky. In its statement, Air Zimbabwe said,
“The maintenance tasks are key in ensuring that the aircraft remains serviceable in line with the ongoing process of dry leasing the aircraft. Discussions and negotiations are at an advanced stage with potential short-listed lessees, and a final position will be officially communicated once an agreement has been signed.”
It added that it hopes to be able to make an announcement in the coming months regarding details of the lease.
Nine airlines have shown interest in leasing Air #Zimbabwe’s two long-haul Boeing 777-200ERs acquired from #Malaysia in a deal expected to generate up to US$400 000 a month.#Ethiopian Airlines is understood to be leading the pack in lease negotiations.
Previously, a representative of the administrator, Mr. Tonderai Mukubvu of Grant Thornton, had indicated there were several airlines in the running to lease the long-haul plane. He told Bulawayo24,
“Government has not made any decision on the final lessee, but we have nine suitors that have shown interest. We are at advanced stages of discussions with all suitors and they all seem capable to lease the planes from a financial capacity perspective.”
It will be interesting to see whether this Boeing 777 ever goes back to Zimbabwe or straight to a lessor from Addis. Perhaps it could even stay in Addis and begin working for the incumbent Ethiopian Airlines. Either way, with it, slated to make a cool $400,000 a month for Air Zim, it could fix up a healthier future for the floundering airline.",0,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare', 'Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport'], 'MYS': ['Malaysia'], 'ETH': ['Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia', 'Addis Ababa'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'GBR': ['United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland', 'London'], 'CHN': ['Beijing']}",-999,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing']

Comment: NewsDay Editor
There were discussions that need further interrogation like food aid, Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa’s comments about the economy and the return of students’ grants for those in tertiary institutions.
Chinamasa, for all his hard work, now sounds like a parrot, repeating his boss’ unsubstantiated claims about the economy.
We will not belabour the point, as we have addressed this issue elsewhere and we do not share Chinamasa’s optimism for the growth of the economy.
Food aid distribution continues to be a sticking issue, amid claims of partisan allocations.
Social Welfare minister Prisca Mupfumira can try to deflect the issue, but this is one thing that always arises and she needs to address this as a matter of urgency.
Then there is the issue of students’ grants raised by Higher and Tertiary Education minister Jonathan Moyo.
While this is a good idea and will go a long way in alleviating hardships suffered by students, there is need to address the modalities — that is where the money will come from, how much it will be and how it would be paid back considering the high default rate on other such schemes.
There is also need to address this grants’ issue vis-a-vis the cadet scheme that the government introduced a few years ago.
The country cannot hop from one policy to another without knowing how the previous one fared and how different the new one would be to its predecessor.
While there are several things that can be discussed, interrogated and improved on, sadly they are drowned by the sycophantic praise for President Robert Mugabe, which does little to develop the country.
The youth league’s proposal to have February 21 declared a national holiday can as well as be plucked out from the pages of George Orwell’s allegorical novel, Animal Farm.
Surely, the era of obsequiousness is long past and we cannot be talking about life presidency in this day and age.
Africa and the world have moved past the era of life presidents and if Zimbabwe does not want to be left behind then it should drop this self-serving idea.
Mugabe’s peers, who seemed to be proponents of life presidency, are now leaving power and this has been accompanied by the improvements in their economies.
Mugabe does not have to look further than Angola, where its leader, Jose Eduardo dos Santos has decided to step down after decades in power.
Thus, instead of focusing on the discussions at conference, the country has to contend with the bootlicking and questioning how a 94-year-old person will run for presidency in two years’ time.",0,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'AGO': ['Republic of Angola']}",-999,[],[],[],['China']

Painona with Tapiwa Nyandoro
On this day the reading was about a very wise man that lived in a remote province of a Chinese empire. Word of the intelligence, cleverness and above all unmatched wisdom of the wise man had reached the jealous ears of his imperial Highness the Emperor of China. A royal letter from the Emperor was duly dispatched to the Province with a “request” to the elders that their famed son attends to the irritation that had befallen the Royal Court.
The Son of heaven and the wise man
The ladies of the court were in great distress, the emperor wrote. Their swing in the royal gardens had gone kaput! The rope made of sand had broken. Would the wise man so spoken highly off by the Province care to restore the swing to its original state? On reading the letter the elders went into mourning. From the outset they knew that the mission of providing a new rope made of sand was near impossible. And He that had to be obeyed was ruthless if his command went unanswered.
However, the wise man journeyed to the royal court and presented himself to the great man. He duly requested from the Son of Heaven a sample of the broken rope made of sand so he could see what he needed to match. On hearing the condition precedent, the emperor smiled and the wise man was invited to join the court’s advisors.
A month or so ago, President Robert Mugabe was in China. Ever the good teacher, he took the opportunity to address Zimbabwean students studying in that super power. He called for, as he is now fond of doing, creating and growing 100% owned indigenous companies.
He pointed out that Zimbabwe has the human capital to obviously emulate, in sustaining robust economic growth, the likes of China and the eastern tigers, Japan, no doubt included. According to press reports, on his birthday bash at Bindura’s Chipadze stadium on Saturday the second of March 2013 he repeated the call.
He noted that Zimbabwe was richly endowed with vast mineral resources that should be used to develop the whole country. He could have added: “and a people with a great work ethic”, and he would have been right on the mark. He added, however, that it was government’s wish to have total control of the exploitation of natural resources via 100% owned indigenous companies.
He dismissed the excuse of not having machinery as the reason for not starting wholly Zimbabwean owned resource companies. “I have told Ministers Mpofu and Kasukuwere,” he is quoted as having said, “that for us to have total control over our resources we should have our own companies. That is real empowerment, but some are resisting that.”
Wise words from the President, but who are those resisting this noble approach? And why should they be fearful of a greenfield approach as called for by His Excellency the Head of State and Government and Commander in Chief of Zimbabwe Defence Forces?
Square pegs in round holes
More like the Chinese Emperor, not however out of jealousy, but driven by a constructive intent, the President, as befitting his age, may have been speaking in code? He fully knows Zimbabwe has 100% indigenously owned resource companies. In mining we have Shabani Mashaba Mines, Ziscosteel, ZMDC and the MMAZ to name a few.
In agriculture we have ARDA, GMB and CSC; in forestry Allied Timbers, in energy there is Zesa and Noczim, whilst in transport we have yester year’s giants such as the NRZ, Air Zimbabwe and Zupco. The list goes own.
With the exception of a few, most of these companies, indigenously owned, albeit collectively and indigenously managed, have been a drain, and not a blessing, to the fiscus. A few of the companies are actually monopolies, but that has not stopped them from falling from grace. Their counterparts in other countries, South Africa included, are doing very well. Once upon a time here too, they did very well.
What has gone wrong? Could it be that starting with the nation’s first Executive Committee, the Cabinet, we have square pegs in round holes? Could it be the reason they may be the ones who are resisting the President’s call? Fear of a greenfield assignment?
It is easy to raid the Zimplats and Unki balance sheets and Share registers, but much harder to grow the ZMDC, Ziscosteel and SMM ones, let alone the Air Zimbabwe one, without the vision and organizational skill of foreigners? The populist streaks of the 51%/49% model are very easy to discern.
Regrettably they make the 100% approach the President aspires for, even more difficult to implement. Yet State capitalism and foreign direct investment, cannot only coexist together, but are in fact synergistic if well managed.
The self styled champions of the 51/49 indigenisation model have failed to echo the call from the President for a 100% model. Instead there has been deafening silence and you hear of “this and that deal”, none of which is wholly owned, and usually none of which is wholly transparent.
Unless they are stopped — and the President’s call for our own companies is a starting point — they will destroy the economy. And the modus operandi being followed may lead to some of those intimately involved in these “deals” bidding for Arsenal Football Club alongside Russian Oligarchs and Arab Sheiks.
The resource case may have struck. The querulous tone of those defending the indefensible in the Zimplats saga may be the first sign. I pray and hope not.

Zimbabwe,8282,newsday.co.zw,2017-08-11T00:00:00Z,Say it loud and clear: ‘Mugabe is not superhuman!’,"Reformist Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who was not ideologically hidebound, famously said: “It doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white, so long as it catches mice.”
echoes: CONWAY TUTANI
Deng was most perspicacious, meaning he had that ability to notice and understand things that are difficult or not so obvious especially when people become conditioned to thinking in a politically correct way — that is, conforming to language and practices that do not offend the political sensibilities of those at the very top who invariably call the shots.
One of the old guard of the Chinese Communist Party, Deng became the party’s secretary-general in 1954, but was purged by Chinese leader, Mao Zedong in 1966 for his strong objections to the excesses of the regime, including the political idolisation of Mao. However, after Mao’s death in 1976, Deng took over as the de facto Chinese leader until his death in 1997, after plucking China from the dark depths of unlimited personalised rule, and prevailing against Mao’s widow Jiang Qing’s grab for power, ending her dynastic pretensions once and for all. Jiang’s fall from grace — no pun intended — was spectacular as she hurtled from the pinnacle of power into prison.
Indeed, China is not a paragon of constitutional democracy, far from it. But Deng left the political legacy where there is leadership change every 10 years. Now, who are worse off between us Zimbabweans — who go through the meaningless ritual of voting when the result is pre-determined to legitimise one-person rule for life that we have been burdened with for all of 37 years and still counting; and the Chinese, who — at the very least — get new leaders every decade? The Chinese don’t pay lip service to democracy. What you see is what you get, not the illusion or mirage of democracy we have here. Deng untiringly articulated the politically incorrect bare truth and facts about the situation despite the personal risk involved. It really takes a brave and principled insider to lay bare the officially-propagated political falsities.
No one is suggesting that Christopher Mutsvangwa is as big or as great as Deng or won’t be, but the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans’ Association (ZNVLWVA) chairperson has amply proved that he is not a yes-man. And — like it doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice — we should not disregard legitimate national issues of grave concern just because they have been raised by Mutsvangwa, as this won’t make them any less critical or less urgent. People eventually resist when they are being made to say and do not just wrong, but bad, things. Deng started out with Mao on the famed epic Long March in 1934, but came to realise decades later that something had gone drastically wrong and pointed it out. Mutsvangwa this week said President Robert Mugabe’s bid to establish a dynasty would be resisted. Said Mutsvangwa: “President Mugabe is gravitating towards dictatorial tendencies, including allowing his wife to make illegal pronouncements on issues in the courts of law.” Yes, we don’t need Jiang-like dangerous dynastic pretensions. They are not part of the Look East Policy package. And, why should First Lady Grace Mugabe unilaterally exonerate Higher Education minister Jonathan Moyo of corruption instead of saying he is innocent until proven guilty? What is her locus standi? Who is she really in such matters?
Mutsvangwa’s “freedom of speech” could be because he is now free from the golden cage that Zanu PF Cabinet ministers are in after Mugabe fired him from the War Veterans portfolio. Now, he is ZNLWVA chairperson not at the pleasure of Mugabe, unlike in Cabinet, but at the pleasure of the war vets themselves.
As for the over-enthusiastic Zanu PF youth league leaders like Kudzanayi Chipanga, who, like attack dogs, are at the beck and call of the First Family, labelling us all as “donkeys” before the First Lady, the perspicacious Deng knew the type very well and saw the damage and danger they could wreak, saying: “Young leading cadres have risen up by helicopter. They should really rise step by step.” Where did Chipanga erupt from? He was parachuted from the top, as one can see from his total accountability to the First Lady, not to the Zanu PF youth league members he supposedly leads. Such irresponsible elements will eventually be stopped when their benefactors and sponsors are gone in the same way it happened in China to those hiding behind Jiang. It’s not a threat, but a promise because history tends to repeat itself.
Continued Mutsvangwa: “When executive authority is being abused, as is happening, a constitutional republic like Zimbabwe can use impeachment, elections or even votes of no-confidence against the monarchists …” Indeed, Mugabe is not beyond impeachment. He would have been recalled from office long ago if there were enough brave men and women in Zanu PF like what befell former South African President Thabo Mbeki in 2008.
So this headline this week in a Zanu-controlled newspaper reading “Cabinet endorses $1 billion RG Mugabe University” did not reveal anything new or significant, making it much ado about nothing. Would Cabinet ministers reject the funding when they are so sheepish? If it may be asked, did Mugabe, to avoid conflict of interest as an interested party, leave the room for the ministers to decide themselves? Was there something like a secret ballot like one which saw South African President Jacob Zuma survive a no-confidence vote this week?
Declared Mutsvangwa: “We will make sure there are free and fair elections [in 2018]. The [opposition] MDC joined us in the constitution-making process. They may have their agenda, but we do not consider them as enemies anymore.”
Yes, it’s ultimately about giving each other political space — not the farce (mahumbwe) looming next year.
I have had criticism, some of it abusive, from some circles that I disproportionately commentate on what Mutsvangwa says just because he is my friend. Lloyd Mutasa, the Dynamos Football Club coach, went ahead to buy his son, Wisdom, for the team. It was not about the son in the player, but about going for the player in his son. I can clearly distinguish the politician in my friend and detach the two from each other as and when. Yes, Mutsvangwa is my friend, but it’s a fact that he issues statements, hard-hitting ones for that matter, regularly — some say too regularly — and this keeps him in the limelight. How often do we read such statements as made by Mutsvangwa this week: “We will not allow them [G40] to use a marriage certificate to effect a putsch [coup]”? You cannot be more lucid than that. It’s clearly expressed and easily understood. Surely, this is stuff that makes news anywhere anytime. I wish I could say the same about Simba Makoni, but when did he last issue a headline-making statement on his own? People can criticise Mutsvangwa’s motives, but his articulation of what is going on cannot be faulted. You quickly get an insight into and understanding of issues.
Continued Mutsvangwa: “Mugabe has no magical powers. He is not superhuman. There is nothing magical about becoming President of Zimbabwe. It all comes from the people. We know he is not superhuman because we made him.”
Indeed, Mugabe is a fallible, faulty human being like you and me and the sooner not only he, but all of us, accept that, the better. By being still the war veterans’ leader against Mugabe’s wishes, Mutsvangwa has indeed shown that Mugabe’s one-centre-of-power mantra, which has strangulated Zanu PF and, by extension, the nation, can be prevailed against.
The lesson to all those who are being treated with malice and purged by Mugabe is that their day will come if they stay true to themselves — like Deng did.

Zimbabwe,2432,chronicle.co.zw,2014-06-07T05:08:56Z,2016 target for Gwayi-Shangani Dam,"The ChroniclePamela Shumba Senior Reporter —
THE government has availed $10 million towards the construction of the Gwayi-Shangani Dam in Matabeleland North as it targets to complete the project by July 2016. A high-powered ministerial delegation toured the project site yesterday, as the government reaffirmed its commitment to finish the project.Ambassador Simon Khaya Moyo, the Senior Minister of State in the President’s Office, Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa, Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Minister Professor Jonathan Moyo, Water, Environment and Climate Minister Saviour Kasukuwere and Matabeleland North Minister of State for Provincial Affairs Cain Mathema emphasised government’s commitment towards the completion of the $121 million dam.The dam is the third largest in the country after Tokwe-Murkosi and Mutirikwi, and is a key component of the Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project which envisages a 245KM pipeline from the Zambezi River to parched Bulawayo.“I’m committing myself to mobilising $10 million so that the construction of the dam continues,” Minister Chinamasa told a news conference after the tour.“The $10 million is expected to take us up to December. We’ve economic challenges of course but I’m confident that the situation will improve and we’ll manage to meet the 2016 target.”He said it was regrettable that delays were costing the government a lot of money, adding that in future, the government would only undertake new projects after old ones had been completed.The minister revealed that delays in completing Tokwe Murkosi Dam has seen the project cost rising from $70 million to $250 million.
Once complete, he said the dam would see the development of massive irrigation schemes that will benefit communities.Minister Kasukuwere said the Gwayi-Shangani Dam would definitely be completed by July 2016.
“We’re going to be doers and we’ll not be associated with failures of the past as far as the construction of this dam is concerned. In July 2016, the dam will definitely be 80 percent complete and we’ll be embarking on the next phase, which is the construction of a pipeline from Gwayi-Shangani Dam to a reservoir in Bulawayo’s Cowdray Park suburb while the third and final phase would be the construction of a 245KM pipeline from the Zambezi River to the Gwayi-Shangani Dam,” said Cde Kasukuwere.He concurred with Cde Chinamasa that the country’s dams should be fully utilised.
“We’ve  invested more than $2 billion in water bodies but most of them are lying idle. All the country’s dams are using only 25 percent of their potential,” he said.“There’s need for us to start expanding and make sure that we bring back the money spent on dams through irrigation schemes.”Knowledge Mudzengerere, the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (Zinwa) chief engineer said financial constraints were seriously impacting progress as the contractor is owed more than $13 million.The ministerial delegation also visited China Africa Sunlight Energy in Lupane, which is expected to begin its mining operations next month.",0,,,"{'ZWE': ['Matabeleland North Province', 'Bulawayo', 'A Zambezi River Lodge']}",-999,[],[],[],['China']
Zimbabwe,7092,theindependent.co.zw,2016-11-25T06:55:40Z,Banks dread bond notes,"LOCAL banks, which on the surface appear to be supporting the introduction of US$200 million worth of the new promissory currency in bond notes into the market, fear a nightmare over accounting standard chaos and operational headaches, the Zimbabwe Independent has been told.
By Bernard Mpofu
This comes as bankers yesterday met Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa over a series of issues affecting the sector, including the bond notes introduction in a few days’ time.
Zimbabwe is reeling from a severe liquidity crunch which has worsened markedly since the announcement of bond notes in May. Government’s bond notes intervention has triggered market fears and panic, as well as hostile resistance.
While banks in the public seem to support the measure, behind the scenes they are sceptical as they dread this might wreak havoc within the financial system and even worsen the crisis.
Bond notes, according to Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor John Mangudya, are backed by a US$200 million African Export and Import Bank (Afreximbank) facility and are largely an export incentive.
A huge publicity campaign is currently underway to soften market resistance ahead of the start of the injection of US$75 million worth of bond notes — through a “drip-feeding” strategy — in the next couple of days.
Documents gleaned by the Independent and details from banking executives show banks are scared of multifaceted problems ranging from legal, operational to accounting standard glitches which might cause bottlenecks and turmoil.
Bank executives say there is an urgent need for interventions by fiscal and monetary authorities to avert the looming crisis triggered by bond notes.
“There are too many unknowns and uncertainties that come with the introduction of bond notes in a few days’ time,” a senior bank executive said yesterday. “There are numerous grey areas and unexplained system-related and operational issues. It doesn’t look good; it might cause confusion.”
A confidential document seen by the Independent circulating in the banking sector proposes critical interventions and urges caution on the issue.
“It would be advisable for banks to maintain separate entries in customers’ accounts for bond notes and foreign currency. A customer who deposits bond notes cannot insist on payment in foreign currency. A customer who deposits foreign currency can however do so even though he cannot immediately sue the bank for as long as the regulations are extant,” the document says. “If the bond notes are subsequently hit by inflation as widely feared, the necessity of having this distinction will become even more important in terms of defining the bank’s liability to its customers.
Upon expiry of the bond notes, those customers who would have deposited foreign currency would be entitled to demand their funds in foreign currency.”
Another senior bank executive said: “There is something we call accounting standard in banking. It is a principle that guides and standardises accounting practices so that financial statements are rational and meaningful across the system and business at large. Bond notes, which are not an orthodox currency, bring a new and serious challenge vis-à-vis that.
“The other issue is that discouraging banks from having bond notes internal accounts may make it practically impossible for banks to keep an audit trail on the notes being deposited, especially for exporters, when one deposits bond notes but needs the bank to approach RBZ to provide the same amount for purposes of cross-border transactions.”
It is understood a proposal by local banks to create mirror accounts in their back offices to monitor the stock of bond notes was rejected by the central bank. Mangudya could not be reached for comment at the time of going to press.
Banking officials are also raising concerns over the lack of transparency on the US$200 million Afreximbank facility after President Robert Mugabe invoked the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures) Act to gazette Statutory Instrument 133 giving legal effect to the introduction of bond notes.
The measure is now subject to a court challenge. Bond notes themselves have also been challenged in the courts before they are out, leaving the promissory currency entangled in further controversy.
“We note that there is no reference at all in the regulations to the US$200 million facility from Afreximbank which, according to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, will be used to finance the export incentives. Without this limitation, there is nothing to stop the central bank from introducing bond notes whose value exceeds the US$200 million,” another document says. “It is inevitable that if the bond notes flood the market, a parallel market for foreign currency will find its way back. This will certainly be boosted by the fact that the regulations peg the bond note as being at par with the United States dollar. The return of the black market will have the attendant effects of fueling inflation in the country.”
The central bank says government will appoint an independent committee to monitor the introduction of bond notes into the system and ensure that they are printed within the parameters of the Afreximbank facility.
One banker said: “In previous policy statements, the central bank has indicated that the bond notes will run parallel with the basket of foreign currencies currently in place. It is alarming that the regulations now provide that a tender of payment in bond notes is valid to discharge foreign currency liabilities. The law should allow people to freely choose the currency that they wish to trade in. This will become significant when the bond notes result in parallel market dealings and fuel inflation. Trade will become impossible as the exchange rate is fixed in the regulations.
“What happens in a scenario where a client wants to do external transactions and comes in with bond notes? Will the bank be obliged to exchange these for US dollars? What happens in a scenario where the client comes in requesting for US dollars in the bank instead of bond notes? In as much as there is scope for constitutional challenge of this statutory instrument, the statutory instrument is currently law and the banks should apply it in their operations, until the success of any legal contests.”
Another senior bank executive warned that experiences that banks had in getting indemnity from the central bank following the flood of litigation in the aftermath of the China Shougang ruling signals the attitude the central bank will take.
“It (RBZ) will not assist the banks. For preparedness, we need to ensure that the bond notes are created as a currency in the system so that they are captured accordingly,” the banker said.
In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of China Shougang International which had sued Standard Chartered Bank for not reimbursing it deposits worth nearly US$49 000 which were raided by the RBZ during its quasi-fiscal operations at the height of the economic meltdown and hyperinflation which ended after the introduction of the multi-currency regime in 2009.
Asked to comment on the issue, Bankers’ Association of Zimbabwe president Charity Jinya said banks would stand guided by the RBZ rules on bond notes.
“Banks will roll out bond notes in line with the operational guidelines that will be issued by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe,” Jinya said. “Once these parameters are communicated, banks will stand ready to comply with the regulatory requirements. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is on record that the bond notes will be supported by the US$200 million Afreximbank facility and, as banks, we are guided by that statement.”",0,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'USA': ['United States']}",-999,[],[],[],['China']
Zimbabwe,10155,newsday.co.zw,2019-01-21T00:00:00Z,Pasi seeks removal from remand,"FORMER Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) commissioner-general Gershem Pasi, who is facing criminal abuse of office charges, has filed a notice before Harare magistrate Rumbidzai Chitumbura, seeking removal from remand.
BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE
Represented by Farai Mushoriwa, Pasi (59), who is on $2 000 bail, has given the State until February 26 to furnish him with a trial date, failing which he would apply for refusal of further remand.
This was after the State indicated that further extra-territorial investigations in Hong Kong were required before taking the matter to trial.
Allegations are that in January 2014, Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet, Misheck Sibanda, led a high-powered delegation, which included Pasi, to China to affirm Inspur Company’s capability to implement e-government projects, including e-taxation at Zimra.
A memorandum of understanding was signed between government and Inspur for e-taxation, targeted to be completed by December 2014.
It is alleged upon return, Pasi set up a Zimra committee to design the systems and also draw specifications of the product to be supplied.
Zimra’s ICT department, headed by Tyiyapo Valempini, together with Inspur engineers, designed the systems.
It is the State’s case that sometime in June 2014, after Zimra and Inspur had agreed on the specification, Pasi did not seek a quotation from Inspur, but took the systems design to Righlux Services (Pvt) Ltd, a Zimbabwean registered company distributing Inspur products.
This was despite the fact that the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC) had authorised direct engagement.
On July 1, 2014, Righlux Services issued a $32 649 939 quotation, purporting it was from Inspur.
It is alleged on August 6, 2014, Pasi, using the Righlux Services quotation, sought authority to engage the State Procurement Board (SPB) for the supply, delivery and installation of the information management system from the OPC.
On September 2, 2014, the SPB acceded to Pasi’s request for direct engagement with Inspur.
Pasi allegedly signed a $32 649 939 contract with Righlux Services, which was couched to reflect that Zimra had signed a contract with Inspur.
Righlux Services allegedly went on to sign another contract with Inspur for the supply of the products to Zimra at a cost of $11 819 000, which Inspur supplied directly to Zimra.
Righlux Services only acted as an intermediary as all the work was done by Inspur engineers from Inspur Zimbabwe.
As a result of Pasi’s actions, Zimra was allegedly prejudiced of $11 944 780 and a potential $8 886 159,32.
Pasi allegedly caused the transfer of $23 763 780 outside the country to beneficiaries who are yet to be identified.

The ruling party resolved to have elections for the Central Committee members before going for the Extraordinary Congress.
The party’s Secretary for Legal Affairs, Cde Patrick Chinamasa, has since communicated to provinces through a circular on the need to hold such elections this week. The Congress’ agenda is to confirm President Mugabe as the party’s Presidential candidate for 2018. It will also seek to elevate a Women’s League member into the Presidium. Manicaland Province’s secretary for administration Cde Kenneth Saruchera confirmed that provincial elections would be held tomorrow.

“We have planned to hold the elections on Wednesday. We start receiving CVs tomorrow (Tuesday) and possibly go into voting on Wednesday,” he said. Cde Saruchera said that they were yet to receive a response from the national executive from the report they filed over resolutions made during their provincial executive committee meeting. They resolved to have some members who were linked to expelled former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, chucked out of the party.

BY TATIRA ZWINOIRA
The visit comes as Zimbabwe is under scrutiny as relations between the two countries seem to be cooling down after the African country recently revoked licences of diamond mining firms operating in Chiadzwa, among them two Chinese companies, Jinan and Ainjin.
ZNCC chief executive officer, Christopher Mugaga told NewsDay yesterday that the delegation will only represent the interests of the private sector and not government.
“We will be going with SMEs to create business-to-business linkages, new business opportunities and build new markets,” he said.
ZNCC is looking to tap into China’s small to medium enterprise market that contributes 60% of that country’s gross domestic product, according to a 2014 World Trade Organisation report.
The China-Africa SMEs Convention is being organised by the Shanghai City government.
One prominent Chinese businessman said they were approaching trade and investment deals with Zimbabwe in “a cautious way”.
According to an agreement between Zimbabwe and China, on business dealings between the two countries that went into force on March 1, 1998, any dispute was to be settled by consultation through diplomatic channels.

Zimbabwe,10756,zimbabwesituation.com,2019-08-03T00:00:57Z,New parliament building takes shape,"By Tinashe Kairiza
CONSTRUCTION of Zimbabwe’s massive new parliament in Mt Hampden near the capital is ahead of schedule, despite the deepening economic crisis militating against the multi-million dollar project, the Zimbabwe Independent can report.
The imposing six-storey parliament building, perched on Mt Hampden, north of Harare, is being financed through a US$100 million grant from the Chinese government with Shanghai Construction Group doing the construction.
It is the largest project in Southern Africa financed by China Aid — a Chinese government-owned global development aid agency — and the biggest to benefit a single African country.
Beijing also bankrolled the US$200 million African Union (AU) Parliament building in Ethiopia, but the building, commissioned in 2012, benefits the entire continent.
Shanghai Construction Group project manager for the Zimbabwe parliament building Cai Li Bo, told the Independent during a tour of the project site that the project was ahead of schedule despite economic bottlenecks affecting operations.
However, he said fuel shortages gripping the country were disrupting the project, with the firm now consuming an estimated 10 000 litres of fuel every month from a monthly requirement of 20 000 litres. The Central Mechanical Department (CMED), which has been supplying fuel for the project, is also struggling to meet the company’s requirement. In addition, the company is failing to access money for the project’s daily needs, including petty cash to purchase basic provisions such as vegetables.
Cai said owing to currency reforms recently introduced by government in June resulting in the re-introduction of the Zimbabwean dollar, and the subsequent scrapping of the multicurrency regime, the company can no longer withdraw US dollars.
The money is converted to local currency using the prevailing bank rate.
“But still, we can’t get the local currency from the bank. It makes things difficult because we need cash for our daily operations,” Cai said.
An attempt to withdraw ZW$10 000, Cai said, has not materialised, three weeks after a request was lodged at the firm’s bank.
Cai said the project has also been affected by power cuts, but the problem was resolved after President Emmerson Mnangagwa visited the construction site in June.
“During our discussions with government representatives, they promised to supply power for this project. For now, we are not experiencing any power interruptions except for routine faults,” Cai said.
Despite the setbacks, Cai said 60% of the work had been done adding the building would be complete by March 2021, in line with the deadline.
“Our aim is to complete the project before the agreed timeframe, and we are working hard to achieve that. We work everyday, including weekends and we have no holidays,” Cai said.
“We work in shifts to make sure that work progresses well. We also pay overtime and have monthly rewards for hard workers and this has given our workers a reason to work hard. We are building a six-storey building and we are on the third floor. We aim to finish the inner and outside structures of the building, so that next year we concentrate on the decorations or finishings.”
He said the massive structure will have two conference centres each with a capacity to accommodate 350 people. It will also have a banquet hall which can accommodate 1 000 people, offices for parliamentary officers and several boardrooms for parliamentary committee sessions.
“We are using 4 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of cement for the project,” Cai said.
He projected that the new parliament building, which is the first project in the envisaged new city, will attract significant investment to Mt Hampden. Anjin, another Chinese company, is already constructing a hotel in the area.
Cai said the project bears testimony to good bilateral relations between China and Zimbabwe, now elevated to strategic levels.
“The project shows that we have good relations. There are no strings attached to the project. China is not demanding anything from Zimbabwe in return for the project. Once we finish, we will hand it over to the government of Zimbabwe and that’s where our role ends,” he said.
The new parliament building’s architectural design borrows heavily from the iconic Great Zimbabwe Monuments — one of the country’s leading tourist resorts and Unesco World Heritage Site — from which the country derives its name.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ETH': ['Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia'], 'USA': ['Hampden']}",-999,"['Shanghai', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Shanghai']","['Beijing', 'Shanghai']","['Shanghai', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Zimbabwe,5020,herald.co.zw,2015-11-28T00:00:09Z,Govt to give clarity on empowerment laws,"Tinashe Makichi Business Reporter
Government will bring clarity to the country’s Indigenisation and Empowerment policy before the end of this year, Finance and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa has said.
Speaking at a breakfast meeting organised by The Herald Business and Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries yesterday, Minister Chinamasa said consultations towards strengthening and clarifying empowerment policies in sectors of the economy outside the resource sector have been completed.
“People should know that policy formulation and building consensus on policy formulation is not won in one big battle, but you have to engage in skirmishes, sometimes protracted. People come from different directions both ideological and economic, therefore reconciling those positions is not easy sometimes.
I think we are getting to a point where we should have resolved issues surrounding the Indigenisation policy before Christmas.”
He said Government remained focused on the issue of indigenisation considering the amount of progress made so far.
Minister Chinamasa said regardless of political differences and ideological divergences people should not fight in a manner that scares away investors.
He said: “Capital is a coward which tends to run away whenever there is a misunderstanding or fights.
“It is important that even if we have differences politically, we should not quarrel to a point that scares away investors. Whenever there is a quarrel, investors start thinking that maybe there is political instability in the country.
“We should quarrel at the level of ideas and move away from throwing stones at each other. Once we start throwing stones at each other, capital will automatically fly away,” said the Minister.
Minister Chinamasa said Government will soon gazette the frameworks and procedures for implementing the indigenisation policy in a manner that promotes both investment and eliminates discretionary application of the law.
He said the measures being implemented will contribute towards the ease of doing business and will render the services sector conducive for foreign direct investment
“We have now laid a firm policy framework for the economy to grow and what remains is implementation considering that some of the policies are at various stages of implementation.
“Foreign direct investment remains key to economic growth and I have always stressed that we must not look at FDI in isolation to local investors,” said Minister Chinamasa.
He added that people should stop treating investors with regards to the colour of their skin and nationality.
Minister Chinamasa said all investors are important and should be given equal opportunities for investment.
He, however, said Government would stick to the 51-49 percent rule in the resources sector.
“The position of indigenisation in the resources sector has been clarified on several occasions by President Robert Mugabe.
To reflect that, contribution of designated entities towards our 51 percent shareholding will be effected through the resource being exploited, and at no monetary cost to the Government or the designated entities,” said the Minister.",0,,,{},-999,[],[],[],['China']
Zimbabwe,5810,herald.co.zw,2016-03-10T00:01:58Z,Axed Airzim managers challenge Finance Act,"Minister of Finance and Economic Development Patrick Chinamasa
Daniel Nemukuyu Senior Court Reporter
The constitutionality of Section 23 of the Finance Act, which protects the property of Air Zimbabwe Holdings (Private) Limited from attachment, has been challenged at the Constitutional Court.
Four former Air Zimbabwe Holdings managers, who are battling to recover their retrenchment packages, argued that the recent amendments to the law were effected to make sure they do not get their retrenchment packages in violation of their constitutional rights.
The amendements, the quartet argued, scuttled their plans to attach and auction the parastatal’s property.
The four are Stephen Nhuta, Kingstone Mbape, Charles Muchenje and Charles Mhonderwa.
When the law was passed, the quartet had been offered retrenchment packages by the airline but $160 000 was still outstanding.
A writ of execution had been issued by the courts to enable the four to attach and auction the company’s property.
The courts had ruled that at the time in question, the airline’s assets were capable of being attached in execution as it was not a successor company to Air Zimbabwe Corporation.
But the recent amendments to the Finance Act now give Air Zimbabwe immunity from attachment.
In a constitutional application filed this week by labour lawyer Mr Caleb Mucheche, on behalf of the quartet, it was argued that the law infringed on the rights of Air Zimbabwe workers.
“I and other applicants have noted that the Finance Act, 2015, particularly Section 23 thereof, infringes upon our fundamental right to equality and the protection of the law, right to private property and labour rights by improperly insulating and shielding the attachment of Air Zimbabwe Holdings (Private) Limited using the State Liabilities Act.
“I respectfully contend that Section 23 of the Finance Act which gives Air Zimbabwe Holding (Private ) Limited’s assets immunity from attachment using the State Liabilities Act is unconstitutional and not reasonably justifiable in a democratic society like Zimbabwe,” the four argued.
The managers argued that Air Zimbabwe Holdings being a private company, should not be protected under the State Liabilities Act.
“The judgment debtor, Air Zimbabwe Holdings (Private) Limited’s assets should be attached to settle the judgment debt it owes us arising from our unpaid retrenchment packages after serving as employees.
“Furthermore, the wording of Section 23 of the Finance Act appears to have a retrospective effect and thus further making it unconstitutional,” they argued.
Nhuta, Mbape, Muchenje and Mhonderwa had served the airline for periods stretching from 30 years to 32 years when they were served with retrenchment letters.
Minister of Finance and Economic Development Patrick Chinamasa, Minister of Justice Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Emmerson Mnangagwa and Attorney-General Advocate Prince Machaya, who were listed as respondents, are yet to respond.
The quartet was retrenched in August 2009 with the company citing viability challenges, but the contested amendments to the law were effected six years later.
The case is yet to be set down for hearing at the Constitutional Court.",0,,,{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe']},-999,[],[],[],['China']

Zimbabwe,6923,chronicle.co.zw,2016-10-08T00:02:56Z,Prophet denies murder charges,"The ChronicleMashudu Netsianda, Senior Court Reporter
ONE of the two Bulawayo prophets who allegedly strangled a police officer in a bushy area near Khami Dam and robbed him of a car, $200, a laptop and two smart phones, has claimed the cop gave him the property as a token of appreciation for cleansing his two haunted houses. Patrick Matikiti (26) of Sauerstown and Assurance Moyo (23) of Lobengula West allegedly took Mr Nhlalo Ndlovu to the bush to “cleanse him of evil spirits” where they allegedly killed and robbed him of a Toshiba laptop, a G-Tel and Huawei cellphones and his car, a Toyota Noah, which they later sold in Harare in December 2014.The duo’s murder trial continued before Bulawayo High Court judge Justice Francis Bere on Thursday.Matikiti took to the witness stand and told the court that he knew nothing about the alleged murder.“I know nothing about the charge. I was surprised when police arrested me and accused me of killing the now deceased who was my client.,” said Matikiti.“In fact, the last time I saw him (Ndlovu) was on the day he gave me his car, cellphones and laptop as appreciation for fixing his two houses in Bulawayo and Victoria Falls. The houses were being haunted by his late wife and I managed to cleanse them of the evil spirits,” he said.Matikiti also accused police of forcing him together with Moyo to the scene of the alleged crime amid threats to shoot them if they resisted.“Police officers took us to a bushy area near Khami Dam and forced us to point out a spot where they alleged that we killed the deceased and robbed him of his car, money and other valuables,” he said.Matikiti said Ndlovu confided in him that he was secretly going to South Africa to look for his child.“Ndlovu was a man of many girlfriends and was very secretive in everything that he did.“He didn’t even tell his family and relatives that he was going to South Africa when he disappeared and I had to keep it a secret,” he said.Ms Hloniphani Buhwa, who was Mr Ndlovu’s girlfriend, told the court that when she contacted Matikiti about her boyfriend’s whereabouts, he claimed that he was taken by a mermaid.She said he also claimed that the spirits revealed to him that Mr Ndlovu was alive.Prosecuting, Ms Nokuthaba Ngwenya said on December 10, 2014, shortly after 6.30PM, Mr Ndlovu approached Matikiti and Moyo seeking to be cleansed of evil spirits.Mr Ndlovu had just arrived from Lupane where he was studying midwifery at St Luke’s Hospital when he sought help from the two alleged prophets.The court heard that Matikiti and Moyo, who already had information that Mr Ndlovu was carrying cash and some valuables in his car, hatched a plan to rob him of his belongings.Upon arrival at Khami Dam at about 9PM, the two men disembarked before they led Mr Ndlovu to a nearby bush where they purportedly intended to conduct a cleansing ceremony to drive away the evil spirits.They allegedly manhandled the cop and choked him using a piece of cloth from their garments.After robbing him, they left his body in the bush.The two drove to Harare where they sold the car. The duo’s arrest was based on a strong suspicion following a report by relatives that Mr Ndlovu was last seen when he visited Matikiti’s home for consultation.Mr Ndlovu’s bone, tooth and toothbrush were taken to the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) Applied Genetic Testing Centre for DNA profiling and the samples matched the police officer’s identity after another paternity test was conducted on the cop’s son and sister.When police searched Matikiti’s house they found Mr Ndlovu’s police ID.The two men then led police to the scene of the crime for indications where the other stolen goods were recovered. The accused persons’ witnesses will testify on Monday. — @mashnets",0,,,"{'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa', 'Harare'], 'ZWE': ['Bulawayo', 'Victoria Falls', 'Khami Dam'], 'CHN': ['Hami']}",-999,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei']
Zimbabwe,5977,herald.co.zw,2016-04-12T00:05:13Z,$100m facility for ARDA,"Golden Sibanda : Senior Business Reporter
The African Export and Import Bank (Afreximbank) is set to avail a $100 million facility to Government for the recapitalisation of the Agricultural Rural Development Authority, Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa has said. The initiative is part of a number of measures Government is pursuing to enhance production on farms owned by ARDA and those acquired under the land resettlement programme’s A2 model.Most of ARDA’s 21 farms are lying idle
with Chisumbanje the only exception yet Zimbabwe faces serious threats of food shortages, especially in the wake of the drought this season.
Minister Chinamasa is on record saying, despite successful conclusion of land redistribution, production on A2 farms was still “scandalously” low and Government is seeking ways to shore it up.
Minister Chinamasa ran through an extensive list of the many multi-million dollar lines of credit the pan African bank has extended to Zimbabwe, now in excess of $4 billion cumulatively.
“With the support of the Afreximbank, we are going to conclude a $100 million facility, which will be spearheaded by ARDA; first to rehabilitate and resuscitate production on the ARDA farms and (secondly) to rehabilitate and resuscitate production on A2 (resettlement) farms.” Minister Chinamasa said.
Agriculture, which requires an average of
$2 billion annually is strategic to Zimbabwe’s economy as it accounts for around 16 percent of the country’s ($10 billion) gross domestic product.
Lack of access to affordable funding, equipment and adequate farming inputs have often been cited for grossly poor production for an economy touted as being agro-based.
The Finance Minister made the remarks recently at a reception for Afreximbank president Dr Benedict Oramah, who pledged more assistance to Zimbabwe.
Afreximbank has extended financing facilities to Zimbabwe since starting operations around 1996 and runs loan lines of credit of over $500 million annually.
Minister Chinamasa said the ARDA facility will complement another initiative with similar thrust or objectives: “Brazil’s More Food for Africa Programme” and would boost production on farms.
Zimbabwe has already received $38 million under the $98 million facility that the South American economic giant has pledged, and this entails tractors, fertiliser, spreaders and irrigation kits targeted at supporting farmers, especially small scale.
“As far as we are concerned, we are going to pour more resources into irrigation rehabilitation and expansion. All this is possible because we have this support from Afreximank,” he added.
The minister also pointed out that Government had provided financial resources for the delineation of farms acquired under the fast track land reform programme to quell bounder disputes.
Further, he said funding had been made available to the Ministry of Lands and Land Resettlement for evaluation of farms acquired under the land reform programme for purposes of compensating former white commercial farmers for improvement, with only 1 500 farms having been evaluated out of 6 000.",0,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'BRA': ['Federative Republic of Brazil']}",-999,[],[],[],['China']
Zimbabwe,11345,chronicle.co.zw,2020-03-17T00:05:32Z,Covid 19: Byo family quarantined,"The ChronicleNqobile Tshili/ Andile Tshuma, Chronicle ReportersA Bulawayo woman who travelled to South Africa for medical attention has been placed under self-quarantine together with her family after a patient treated by her South African doctor tested positive for Covid-19.In Harare, two other people, one who travelled from China and another from the United Kingdom are now in isolation at Wilkins Hospital in Harare. Results for the three cases are expected to be released today. Cabinet is also today expected to decide on Bulawayo’s hosting of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair and Independence Day celebrations as more manpower is being deployed to Beitbridge Border Post for screening of Covid-19 following an increase in South Africa’s positive cases.South Africa, which has closed 35 of its ports of entry, yesterday said it would not close the border with Zimbabwe due to its economic importance as positive cases reached 64.In an interview yesterday, Health and Child Care Minister, Dr Obadiah Moyo said in Bulawayo, the woman who had sought medical attention in South Africa was under isolation with her family at home. “Her doctor attended to another patient who tested positive for corona at the same facility while she was also there in Johannesburg South Africa. It is not the doctor who tested positive. The woman returned in the country on Tuesday 9 March. She is in self-quarantine, the rapid response team visited her home and put her in quarantine at home while waiting for results. No one from that house can go out and environmental health officials pay visit daily to her home to assess if they are in compliance with self-quarantine orders,” said the Minister. “In light of this development we remain at the same situation unless the results  state otherwise. For all the cases we are waiting for results. They are other two, one who came from Shanghai (China) and the other one from United Kingdom. They are both admitted at Wilkins Hospital. We don’t want people to panic,  once we have the results, we will make them public. The results for the three cases will be released tomorrow (today).”Dr Moyo said a tourist who left the country on March 10 via South Africa also tested positive upon his return to his home country,the United Kingdom.He said Government has since started contact tracing of all those who interfaced with the tourist in Victoria Falls. Dr Moyo said more people will be deployed to Beitbridge to strengthen capacity in the event of high volumes of traffic pushed by the closure of other borders which people previously used to access south Africa.On Sunday, the Minister told The Chronicle that Cabinet will today decide on Bulawayo’s hosting of Independence celebrations and other related issues.Bulawayo Mayor Councilor Solomon Mguni in an interview said council’s report from the Health Services Department on its position on hosting of major events in the face of the threat of Covid-19 will be released later this week.He said for now council will await Cabinet’s decision. “I have said it would be safer to suspend all big gatherings for at least two months while observing global trends and paving a way forward. It poses a big risk to bring the world to converge here when there is such a problematic virus. “However, we eagerly await cabinet to decide and hope that the decision will be the best in the public interest,” said the Mayor. Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education Mrs Tumisang Thabela said schools that were telling parents and guardians to keep children at home if they exhibited flu like symptoms were doing the right thing. “We are still waiting for an update from the Ministry of Health and Child Care therefore any major decision that we can take as a ministry will be guided by the health ministry. Schools that are telling parents to withdraw pupils who exhibit flu like symptoms are doing the right thing as they are protecting the sick child, the rest of the class, the school and the teacher. “For now, one can never be so sure when it comes to flue. It is therefore necessary that the best safest measures are taken, as we await guidance,” she said. Zimbabwe Council of Churches secretary general Dr Kenneth Mtata in a statement yesterday urged members and Zimbabweans in general to avoid the “contact practice.”He said the virus was spreading fast and Africa will not be spared.“It is now clear that the Covid 19 has been declared a pandemic and is spreading fast around the world. Faith communities are especially vulnerable because religion is a contact practice through holy communion, baptisms, laying of hands, handshakes, embraces, kisses of love. Faith communities will need to desist from these contact rituals to avoid contaminating each other and getting infected. We also need to dispel myths like black people are immune from the virus and that Africa will be spared. If possible, avoid being part of any crowd or gathering,” he said. Some Zimbabweans in South Africa are in panic mode as the virus spreads in the neighbouring country.Locals are also worrying about relatives scattered across Europe, Asia, America and some parts of Africa where the virus is ravaging.Zimbabwe Community in South Africa Chairman Mr Ngqabutho Mabhena urged Zimbabweans not to panic but to remain calm and follow all advice on staying safe from the Covid-19. “Zimbabweans in South Africa are updated by the announcements made by the South African government. Some gatherings for the Zimbabwe community which had been scheduled for this month have since been cancelled,” he said.“We also want to concur with the department of health and to remind all Zimbabweans here to follow all guidance on hygiene and staying safe so as to protect ourselves and our families. We further urge the people to desist from any large gatherings as per the government directive.” ",0,,,"{'None': ['Africa', 'Europe', 'Asia'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Shanghai'], 'GBR': ['United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Bulawayo', 'Harare', 'Victoria Falls'], 'USA': ['United States']}",diplomatic_sanction,['Shanghai'],['Shanghai'],['Shanghai'],"['Shanghai', 'China']"

Zimbabwe,9524,herald.co.zw,2018-06-13T00:01:45Z,Zim relaxes visa terms for Chinese tourists,"Fidelis Munyoro Senior Reporter
All Chinese nationals visiting the country will now be required to obtain visas at ports of entry with effect from next month after Government reviewed the country’s visa regime to boost the tourism industry. Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Minister Obert Mpofu said a firmer and all-inclusive arrangement was adopted following President Mnangagwa’s visit to China in April this year.
He made the announcement during the handover of furniture and equipment to the Department of Immigration and the Zimbabwe Republic Police in Harare last week.
“I am happy to announce that the two governments have agreed that as from the 1st of July 2018 Chinese nationals, whether travelling as a group or individually intending to visit the country, will obtain visas at ports of entry,” said Minister Mpofu.
The Zimbabwe migration management system comprises a three-tier visa model classified into categories A, B and C.
Category A refers to countries whose nationals are exempt from visa requirements while those in category B obtain visas at the port of entry, that is on arrival, while category C nationals are required to apply for visas prior to travel.
Minister Mpofu said Chinese nationals seeking permits to enable them pursue other activities in the country must observe the international practice, which demands that they obtain such documents prior to travelling to Zimbabwe.
“I am referring to permits such as temporary employment, students’ and spousal permits,” he said.
“I have pointed this out to dissuade any such applicants who might want to take advantage of access to the country and only submit applications for permits while already in the country. This would be against the spirit of the bilateral arrangement and would not be accepted.”
At least 37 countries including China, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Algeria, Turkey and Cuba had been moved from category C to category B.
Although China was now in category B, there were conditions attached to that elevation.
Some of the conditions were that only Chinese tourists travelling as a group cleared by tour operators and travel agencies in their country, qualified for category B.
Speaking at the same occasion, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Huang Ping said the decision to further relax the visa regime for Chinese tourists was made by the Cabinet and announced by President Mnangagwa in his talks with his counterpart President Xi Jinping.
“This is one of the significant outcomes of H.E.’s (President Mnangagwa) State visit to China early this year,” said Mr Huang.
“This policy, upon implementation, will certainly attract more Chinese tourists and investors to Zimbabwe, injecting new impetus to its development.
“As more Chinese come, there will be a growing demand for better service and management of them in terms of the visa, working and residence permits and other security-related issues arising therefrom.”
The Chinese Embassy donated 5 000 litres of petrol and 20 Huawei mobile phones to the Zimbabwe Republic Police.
The Department of Immigration received a conference table with eight chairs, a set of white leather sofas, and a set of black leather sofas, 50 desks, 50 office chairs, 2 large desks and 10 desktop computers while the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service received 500 blankets and 10 mobile phones.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the Ministry of Defence, Security and War Veterans each received a donation of 10 desktop computers and 10 ZTE mobile phones.
Mr Huang said the donations would go a long way to ensure the Government departments are better equipped to execute their mandates.

Zimbabwe,6224,zimbabwesituation.com,2016-05-17T07:59:00Z,Kick out all Chinese nationals: Biti’s PDP,"ZIMBABWE must, immediately, kick out all Chinese nationals, the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) said Monday.
The opposition party accused Beijing of blatantly pillaging the economically crippled country.
Little of the mega-deals promised by Beijing have materialised but the Chinese have externalised billions of dollars from Zimbabwe, leaving behind a collapsed economy with millions of locals unemployed.
“The PDP calls on all Zimbabweans and other international stakeholders to come together and call for the Chinese to exit our country immediately,” said Willias Madzimure, PDP Secretary for International Relations.
“They (Chinese nationals) have contributed nothing of value except to aid a corrupt and repressive political system while looting away our national resources.”
President Robert Mugabe, a former darling of the West knighted by the British Crown, pivoted towards China after western capitals shut their doors on him; displeased with his violent rule and electoral chicanery – so they charged.
But more than a decade after adopting the so-called Look East policy, Beijing has profited from the arrangement while Harare boasts of “unemployment of 90% … (while) 4.5 million citizens are in need of food aid”.
The most blatant looting, said Madzimure in a statement Monday, related to the diamond discovery at Marange in the eastern Manicaland province.
“By its own admission, the failed Zanu PF regime confirmed … that the Chinese were looting diamond money,” he said.
“Mugabe, in a bizarre admission, informed the suffering masses that under his watch Zimbabwe lost a whopping US$15 billion worth of diamond revenue.”
The pillaging was conducted with the connivance of dodgy Chinese businessmen who have since been jailed by Beijing.
“The government worked with a coterie of shadowy Chinese companies such as Anjin, Jinan among others which were fronted by criminals such as the now jailed Sam Pa,” said Madzimure.
He added: “The Chinese have literary invaded the national economy and are milking all the profits back to Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong.
“One of the striking features of the Chinese operations is that they do not pay their taxes and smuggle goods into the country by undervaluing their goods and not declaring most of their imports.
“They also bribe ZIMRA officials at the borders and offer handouts to ZANU PF politicians as ways to evade paying taxes and thus prejudice the nation billions in revenue.
“More dangerously, the Chinese have some of the most deplorable labour relations. They over-work their employees, under pay them and often assault them at work places.”
While looting the crippled nation, Beijing has also actively worked to ensure the “failed” Zanu PF regime remains in power.
“In return for having been given unfettered access to the national economy by the desperate Mugabe regime, the Chinese have offered political protection at international level,” Madzimure said.
He continued: “Thus the Chinese are at the centre of Zimbabwe’s challenges.
“By, on one hand, aiding and abetting the criminal Mugabe regime and, on the other, salting away billions of dollars from the country, the Chinese are killing the country twice.
“They are sustaining and perpetuating oppression of the worst kind while ensuring that the present and future generations of the country are permanently economically disempowered and disinherited forever.
“This is the worst kind of imperialism and as Zimbabweans we must rise and resist it.”
Zimbabwe, the PDP official added, has little to show for Mugabe’s much-vaunted ‘Look East’ policy.
“Any investment must be mutually beneficial to both parties but in our case it is the Chinese criminals and their local puppets that are eating the national cake.
“All which is there to show for ordinary citizens is deep seated poverty, squalor, hunger and a scared environment, a permanent mark of the historical looting of our minerals by Chinese thieves.”",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare', 'Manicaland Province', 'Marange Clinic'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'Jinan', 'Shanghai']}",diplomatic_sanction,"['Chinese', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Chinese']","['Chinese', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Zimbabwe,11509,newsday.co.zw,2020-04-13T00:00:00Z,African ambassadors in China complain to government over 'discrimination',"JOHANNESBURG-African ambassadors in China have written to the country’s foreign minister over what they call discrimination against Africans as the country seeks to prevent a resurgence of the coronavirus.
Reuters
Several African countries have separately also demanded that China address their concerns that Africans, in particular in the southern city of Guangzhou, are being mistreated and harassed.
Having brought under control the original outbreak centred on the city of Wuhan, China is now concerned about imported cases and is stepping up scrutiny of foreigners coming into the country and tightening border controls. It has denied any discrimination.
In recent days Africans in Guangzhou have reported being ejected from their apartments by their landlords, being tested for coronavirus several times without being given results and being shunned and discriminated against in public. Such complaints have been made in local media, and on social media.
The ambassadors’ note said such “stigmatisation and discrimination” created the false impression that the virus was being spread by Africans.
“The Group of African Ambassadors in Beijing immediately demands the cessation of forceful testing, quarantine and other inhuman treatments meted out to Africans,” it said.
The note was sent to China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, copying the chair of the African Union, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and all African foreign ministers.
The Chinese foreign ministry’s International Press Centre did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the note, sent outside of business hours.
The Chinese embassy in South Africa also did not respond.
Foreign affairs official Liu Baochun told a news conference on Sunday that Guangzhou is enforcing anti-virus measures on anyone who enters the city from across the national border, regardless of nationality, race or gender.
The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe on Saturday dismissed the accusation that Africans were being deliberately targeted.
“It is harmful to sensationalize isolated incidents,” it said in a tweeted statement. “China treats all individuals in the country, Chinese and foreign alike, as equals.”
DISAPPOINTMENT
The ambassadors’ note highlighted a number of reported incidents, including that Africans were being ejected from hotels in the middle of the night, the seizure of passports, and threats of visa revocation, arrest or deportation.
On Saturday, Ghana’s foreign minister of affairs Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey said she had summoned the Chinese ambassador to express her disappointment and demand action.
Kenya’s foreign ministry has also “officially expressed concern”, adding the government is working with Chinese authorities to address the matter.
On Friday, Nigerian legislator Akinola Alabi tweeted a video of a meeting between the leader of Nigeria’s lower house of parliament, Femi Gbajabiamila, and Chinese Ambassador Zhou Pingjian. In it, Gbajabiamila demanded an explanation from the diplomat after showing Zhou a video of a Nigerian complaining about mistreatment in China.
The ambassador said in response to the questions from the house leader that he took the complaints “very seriously” and promised to convey them to the authorities back home.

A HIGH Court judge has ordered the magistrates’ court in Hwange to temporarily stop prosecution of seven Chinese nationals who are being charged with possessing ivory and money laundering pending a review of their application for discharge.
Bulawayo High Court judge Justice Martin Makonese granted interim relief to the accused through a provisional order over the weekend.
“Interim relief is granted on the provisional order that proceedings be and are hereby stayed pending the return date of this provisional order,” said Justice Makonese.
The regional magistrate presiding over the trial court in Hwange Mr Collet Ncube and the State are cited as 1st and 2nd respondents.
The judge said the respondents can file notice of opposition with opposing affidavits within 10 days before the review hearing can be set down.
The order halts the trial of Zeng Dengui (35), Peicon Jang (35), Liu Cheng (23), Yu Xian (25), Yong Zhu (25), Chen Zhiangfu (30) and Qui Jinchang (29) pending determination of their application for review of an earlier application for discharge which was dismissed by the magistrate.
Their lawyers, Mr Martin Chakasara instructed by Mr Givemore Mvhiringi of Mvhiringi and Associates applied for review of dismissal of the earlier application and also for stay of prosecution last week pending determination of the application.
The defence argued that the State led by Mrs Marth Cheda and Ms Memory Munsaka failed to bring compelling evidence incriminating the accused at the close of the State’s case.
The seven Chinese nationals were supposed to be put on their defence last week.
The court deferred the matter to today following the two applications.
Defence team is expected to serve the provisional order to the trial court with no further prosecution pending determination on the review process.
Prosecutors allege that the accused were found in possession of several pieces of rhino horns weighing 20,98kg and valued at $938 700 at house number 858 Aerodrome suburb in Victoria Falls where they were renting.
Dengui, Jang, Cheng, Xian, Zhu, Zhiangfu and Jinchang have been in custody since their arrest on December 23 and have pleaded not guilty to money laundering and possession of ivory.
Police allegedly received a tip-off and raided the house after obtaining a search warrant from court. They recovered several pieces of rhino horns weighing 20,98kg in a bedroom used by one of the accused.
A digital scale was also recovered. The house belongs to a taxidermist who operates a wildlife trophy shop. — @ncubeleon",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Victoria Falls'], 'PRK': ['Democratic People’s Republic of Korea']}",diplomatic_sanction,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese']

What is the latest?The death toll from the new virus, which is officially called 2019-nCov, now stands at 259.
All the deaths occurred within China and the majority were in Hubei province, where the virus originated.
Almost 12,000 cases have been confirmed and a small proportion of those – around 100 – have been identified outside China. The UK, US, Russia and Germany have all confirmed cases in recent days.
Meanwhile authorities in Hubei extended the Lunar New Year holiday until 13 February and announced marriage registrations would be suspended to discourage public gatherings.
China started celebrating the holiday on 24 January, and Chinese officials had already extended the break in an attempt to postpone travel by large numbers of people as they return to work.
Hospital workers in Hong Kong have voted to go on strike from Monday unless the territory’s border with mainland China is completely closed. The Hong Kong government has refused to do so citing WHO recommendations.
The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has overtaken that of the similar Sars epidemic, which spread to more than two dozen countries in 2003.
But the mortality rate of the new virus is much lower than that of Sars, which has led officials to believe it is not as deadly.
Estimates by the University of Hong Kong suggest the total number of cases could be far higher than official figures suggest. More than 75,000 people may have been infected in the city of Wuhan, which is at the epicentre of the outbreak, experts say.
How are countries outside China responding?A string of travel restrictions have been announced in recent days.
The US, which declared a rare public health emergency, banned entry from all foreign nationals who had visited China in the past two weeks.
US citizens and residents returning from Hubei province, where the outbreak started, will be quarantined for 14 days. Those returning from other parts of China will be allowed to monitor their own condition for a similar period.
Another confirmed case in the US on Friday – in California – brought the number there to seven. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said 191 people were under observation.
Australia, which announced a similar ban, said any of its own citizens arriving from China would be quarantined for two weeks.
Media captionInside the US laboratory developing a coronavirus vaccineThere have also been a number of evacuations from China as foreign governments work to bring their citizens back.
More than 300 Indians arrived in Delhi on Saturday after they were evacuated from Wuhan, while about 100 Germans arrived in Frankfurt later the same day.
Thailand is also set to evacuate its nationals from the city in the coming days.
Russia will evacuate several hundred of its citizens from Hubei province on Monday and Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
Countries evacuating citizens are expected to quarantine them for two weeks to monitor them for symptoms and avoid contagion.

The coronavirus outbreak is all but grinding this economic juggernaut to a halt.
Tianjin, an industrial port city of 15 million people, is the latest metropolis to announce that all non-essential business should stop. Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing are lifeless when compared to their normal selves.
There is a feeling that the entire country is being placed in isolation, with international airlines halting mainland China connections and other countries declaring that Chinese passport holders will be denied entry for the time being.
Yet, in some respects, these governments are following China’s lead after it locked down the entire province of Hubei, where the virus emergency started.
Diary of a life in locked-down WuhanCoronavirus: What it does to the bodyWuhan: The London-sized city where the virus beganMost people seem to welcome the decisive action from the government, given the circumstances. But officials in Wuhan are being slammed for their slow response in the early stages. Some even worked to prevent the news getting out.
And as if to illustrate how quickly this virus can spread, a doctor who was one of a group of whistleblowers who tried to sound the alarm in December says he now has the virus himself.
Li Wenliang was initially hauled over the coals by local police for “spreading rumours” and “disrupting social order” after he posted a message on his alumni chat group that said his hospital had isolated patients who had contracted Sars.
It turned out to be the new virus, but China’s Supreme Court has criticised Wuhan police for reprimanding him and the other whistleblowers. yahoo

Zimbabwe,9139,zimbabwesituation.com,2018-03-02T13:59:56Z,Chinamasa barred from Germany,"A DIPLOMATIC rift between European superpowers Britain and Germany over Zimbabwe emerged this week when the British government hosted Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa while the Germans barred him from visiting. This came as Berlin adopts a cautious approach towards the Zimbabwean government, ushered in through a military intervention last year, in line with the European Union stance.
By Wongai Zhangazha
Chinamasa was in Britain this week for high-level diplomatic talks aimed at mending ties between Harare and London. British Secretary for Foreign Affairs Boris Johnson on Tuesday tweeted that he was excited to meet Chinamasa.
Government sources told the Zimbabwe Independent that Chinamasa also intended to visit European economic powerhouse Germany but was turned down, resulting in him limiting his visit to the more receptive London.
Britain and other countries in the European Union (EU) differ on their approach to President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government. The British are more accommodative and want to support the new administration as much as possible but the EU block has taken a cautious approach.
Britain has been aggressive in its support of the new administration. It has been impressed by statements made by Mnangagwa so far on economic and political reforms.
However, the EU wants government to match rhetoric with action, particularly on the implementation of critical political and economic reforms before committing significant funding to the broke government.
The EU says the bloc would consider scaling up financial assistance to Zimbabwe if Mnangagwa’s government delivers on its pledge to hold free, fair and credible elections, as well as implement reforms that would set the country’s fragile economy on a firm growth trajectory.
Despite the differences in approach, both Britain and the EU’s 28 member states have demanded a commitment to credible, peaceful, free and fair elections that are monitored by international observers.
Sources in government say although the Germans have decided to be supportive of the Mnangagwa administration, they do not want to fully endorse the regime until it fairly wins polls and ushers in tangible reforms, hence the snub.
Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel in December sent Mnangagwa a congratulatory message after his inauguration.
Merkel said: “Germany will support you as a partner in your endeavours to start a new chapter in the history of Zimbabwe — one characterised by democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.”
Government sources say the Germans want to see a tangible implementation of a number of economic, political and social reforms, given that their nationals’ investments, including farms and wildlife conservancies, protected under the Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with Zimbabwe have over the years been grabbed.
Germany ambassador to Zimbabwe Thorsten Hutter confirmed Chinamasa failed to visit Berlin this week. He attributed the failure to transitions taking place in his country, although he admitted there were also bilateral bottlenecks to be taken care of.
“We do hope that the minister of Finance (Chinamasa) whom I had seen last Friday will indeed come to Germany soon and of course he is welcome in Germany. What I had explained is that we have a caretaker government at the moment. Tomorrow (today) the internal poll within the Social Democratic party will end and if the Social Democratic Party membership as a whole votes in favour of the grand coalition between the Socio Democrats and the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union then within the next two or three weeks a new government will be formed,” said Hutter.
“But at the moment we only have a caretaker government so we thought that the timing was not right. Indeed there are some bilateral issues that we thought should be resolved before the visit. I hope that is something that we will be able to sort out in the coming days.”
Germany has the largest national economy in Europe, the fourth-largest by nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the world after United States in America, China and Japan, and fifth by GDP (purchasing power parity). It surpasses Britain which is in the process of pulling out of the EU through its controversial Brexit process.
Other super powers like the US have also been cautious with Zimbabwe. The US recently extended its targeted sanctions with the possibility of a review after the general elections expected later this year.

Zimbabwe,9577,zimbabwesituation.com,2018-06-13T08:15:20Z,Zim relaxes visa terms for Chinese tourists,"Cde Mpofu
Fidelis Munyoro Senior Reporter
All Chinese nationals visiting the country will now be required to obtain visas at ports of entry with effect from next month after Government reviewed the country’s visa regime to boost the tourism industry. Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Minister Obert Mpofu said a firmer and all-inclusive arrangement was adopted following President Mnangagwa’s visit to China in April this year.
He made the announcement during the handover of furniture and equipment to the Department of Immigration and the Zimbabwe Republic Police in Harare last week.
“I am happy to announce that the two governments have agreed that as from the 1st of July 2018 Chinese nationals, whether travelling as a group or individually intending to visit the country, will obtain visas at ports of entry,” said Minister Mpofu.
The Zimbabwe migration management system comprises a three-tier visa model classified into categories A, B and C.
Category A refers to countries whose nationals are exempt from visa requirements while those in category B obtain visas at the port of entry, that is on arrival, while category C nationals are required to apply for visas prior to travel.
Minister Mpofu said Chinese nationals seeking permits to enable them pursue other activities in the country must observe the international practice, which demands that they obtain such documents prior to travelling to Zimbabwe.
“I am referring to permits such as temporary employment, students’ and spousal permits,” he said.
“I have pointed this out to dissuade any such applicants who might want to take advantage of access to the country and only submit applications for permits while already in the country. This would be against the spirit of the bilateral arrangement and would not be accepted.”
At least 37 countries including China, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Algeria, Turkey and Cuba had been moved from category C to category B.
Although China was now in category B, there were conditions attached to that elevation.
Some of the conditions were that only Chinese tourists travelling as a group cleared by tour operators and travel agencies in their country, qualified for category B.
Speaking at the same occasion, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Huang Ping said the decision to further relax the visa regime for Chinese tourists was made by the Cabinet and announced by President Mnangagwa in his talks with his counterpart President Xi Jinping.
“This is one of the significant outcomes of H.E.’s (President Mnangagwa) State visit to China early this year,” said Mr Huang.
“This policy, upon implementation, will certainly attract more Chinese tourists and investors to Zimbabwe, injecting new impetus to its development.
“As more Chinese come, there will be a growing demand for better service and management of them in terms of the visa, working and residence permits and other security-related issues arising therefrom.”
The Chinese Embassy donated 5 000 litres of petrol and 20 Huawei mobile phones to the Zimbabwe Republic Police.
The Department of Immigration received a conference table with eight chairs, a set of white leather sofas, and a set of black leather sofas, 50 desks, 50 office chairs, 2 large desks and 10 desktop computers while the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service received 500 blankets and 10 mobile phones.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the Ministry of Defence, Security and War Veterans each received a donation of 10 desktop computers and 10 ZTE mobile phones.
Mr Huang said the donations would go a long way to ensure the Government departments are better equipped to execute their mandates.
“These donations also represent the sincerity of the Chinese community to make more contributions to the Zimbabwe society,” he said.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'GNQ': ['Republic of Equatorial Guinea'], 'IRN': ['Islamic Republic of Iran'], 'DZA': ['People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria'], 'TUR': ['Republic of Turkey'], 'CUB': ['Republic of Cuba']}",diplomatic_sanction,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

BY TATIRA ZWINOIRA
China was placed under Category B of countries, whose nationals apply for visas upon entry into Zimbabwe.
Speaking at a Press conference in Harare yesterday, immigration department principal director Clemence Masango said there were, however, conditions Chinese nationals have to meet before being granted visas.
“The eligibility for Chinese nationals is that only Chinese tourists travelling as a group (two or more people) cleared by tour operators and travel agencies in China can qualify. Chinese business persons and other citizens of China as approved by their government will continue to apply for visas online,” Masango said.
“Zimbabwe is removing all visa controls in respect of Sadc countries in line with and fulfilment of the spirit and objectives of the Sadc protocol on the facilitation of the movement of persons.”
Thirty-seven countries, including China, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Algeria, Turkey and Cuba, were moved from Category C to Category B under the new measures announced yesterday.
A measly 6 000 Chinese tourists visited Zimbabwe last year, the worst in the region, as Botswana had an estimated
43 000, Zambia 55 000 and South Africa 158 000, to name a few.
The visa regime consists of three categories A, B and C.
Under category A, foreign nationals are exempt from visa requirements, B states that visas must be obtained upon entry and C requires nationals to apply for visas prior to travel.

Brian Nichols, an African American, is an “Uncle Tom” used by the United States government to “propagate values which they themselves don’t practise on their own people,” Zanu-PF’s acting spokesman Patrick Chinamasa railed at a news conference in Harare.
Chinamasa said Nichols, who has spoken out against human rights abuses and corruption, was one of a “coterie of gangsters and mercenaries who are disguised as diplomats.”

“I want to warn and remind them that it’s high time they get to know that Zimbabwe is a sovereign state,” Chinamasa said, adding that Nichols should be “totally ashamed of himself.”
“He continues to engage in acts of undermining this republic and if he does so, if he continues engaging in acts of mobilising and funding disturbances, coordinating violence and training insurgents, our leadership will not hesitate to give him marching orders,” Chinamasa thundered.
He added: “Diplomats should not behave like thugs, and Brian Nichols is a thug. We remind Nichols that he’s not a super diplomat to this country… He pretends to be our prefect. We have nothing to learn from the United States or those countries that imposed sanctions. They are no respecters of human rights.”
Chinamasa claimed Nichols’ predecessor, Christopher Dell, had attempted to push Zanu-PF out of power and failed.
“Nichols should learn from his predecessor… He tried it and he realised the shoes were too big for him. Don’t dare Zimbabwe, we are waiting for you.”
The United States embassy has led criticism of official corruption as well as the abductions and torture of President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s opponents.
The embassy denies meddling, and says it is merely holding Mnangagwa’s regime to the democratic values set out in Zimbabwe’s constitution.

Zimbabwe,11475,chronicle.co.zw,2020-04-12T22:06:31Z,"African nationals ‘mistreated, evicted’ in China over coronavirus","The ChronicleAfrican students and expatriates in China are reportedly being evicted from their homes and mistreated over fears they could spread the novel coronavirus.African ambassadors in China have written to the country’s foreign minister over what they call discrimination against Africans as the country seeks to prevent a resurgence of the coronavirus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last December.Several African countries have separately also demanded that China address their concerns that Africans, in particular in the southern city of Guangzhou, are being mistreated and harassed.In recent days Africans in Guangzhou have reported being evicted from their apartments by their landlords, being tested for coronavirus several times without being given results, and being shunned and discriminated against in public. Such complaints have been made in local media and on social media.Having brought under control the original outbreak centred on the city of Wuhan, Beijing is now concerned about imported cases and is stepping up scrutiny of foreigners coming into the country and tightening border controls. It has denied any discrimination.Al Jazeera’s Sarah Clarke, reporting from Hong Kong, said there seemed to be a concern in China that the African community in Guangzhou could be behind a second wave of infections.“There is an escalating scrutiny of foreign nationals, but they are targeting the Africans and the African American community. Since last Thursday we saw 114 new cases reported in Guangzhou of coronavirus infections and 16 of those were Africans.”“We’ve seen a number of reports from social media from members of the African community in Guangzhou making complaints of mistreatment, arrests, eviction and being denied access to restaurants and hotels, and some students are even claiming to be living on the streets and being denied food,” she said.The African ambassadors’ letter sent to China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, highlighted a number of reported incidents, including that Africans were being ejected from hotels in the middle of the night, the seizure of passports, and threats of visa revocation, arrest or deportation.The note said such “stigmatisation and discrimination” created the false impression that the virus was being spread by Africans.“The Group of African Ambassadors in Beijing immediately demands the cessation of forceful testing, quarantine and other inhuman treatments meted out to Africans,” it said.Foreign affairs official Liu Baochun told a news conference on Sunday that Guangzhou is enforcing anti-virus measures on anyone who enters the city from across the national border, regardless of nationality, race or gender.The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe on Saturday dismissed the accusation that Africans were being deliberately targeted.“It is harmful to sensationalise isolated incidents,” it said in a tweeted statement. “China treats all individuals in the country, Chinese and foreign alike, as equals.”Al Jazeera’s Ahmed Idris, reporting from the Nigerian capital Abuja, said there is both “anger and disbelief” among the African officials.On Saturday, Ghana’s foreign affairs minister Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey said she had summoned the Chinese ambassador to express her disappointment and  demand action.Kenya’s foreign ministry has also “officially expressed concern”, adding the government is working with Chinese authorities to address the matter.On Friday, Nigerian legislator Akinola Alabi tweeted a video of a meeting between the leader of Nigeria’s lower house of parliament, Femi Gbajabiamila, and Chinese Ambassador Zhou Pingjian. In it, Gbajabiamila demanded an explanation from the diplomat after showing Zhou a video of a Nigerian complaining about mistreatment in China.Al Jazeera’s Idris said, privately, there is also a concern that the incidents could have repercussions for the Chinese community living in Africa. “There is also a fear among African governments of backlash against Chinese workers working on the African continent because of what is happening in Guangzhou and other parts of China as well,” Idris said.-Al Jazeera.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Wuhan', 'Guangzhou', 'Beijing'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'GHA': ['Republic of Ghana'], 'NGA': ['Federal Republic of Nigeria', 'Abuja'], 'HKG': ['Hong Kong']}",diplomatic_sanction,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Wang Yi', 'Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Wang Yi']","['Wang Yi', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

TWO Chinese investors who were prohibited from entering the country following their deportation last year, have taken the immigration department to court challenging its decision to declare them prohibited immigrants.
Zheng Jie (58) who is the director of Jie and Beat Enterprises and his business partner Xia XiaoJun (48) were arrested early this year after they re-entered the country using new passports.
They recently appeared before Bulawayo regional magistrate Mr. Collet Ncube facing charges of contravening sections 11(1) and (5) of the Immigration Act.
Xia and Zheng were arrested on August 15 last year after illegally entering the country through Plumtree Border Post. They were convicted and deported back to China. They were declared prohibited immigrants.
According to court papers, instead of appealing against the prohibition notice, Xia and Zheng acquired new passports and returned to the country on December 30 last year through Plumtree Border Post.
They were arrested at the immigration offices while trying to extend their stay in the country.
Xia and Zheng through their lawyers, Mathonsi Ncube Law Chambers, filed an application at the Bulawayo High Court citing the immigration department in Bulawayo as a respondent.
They are seeking an order interdicting the immigration department from deporting them pending the determination of review proceedings.
In his founding affidavit, Zheng said he has registered a company in Zimbabwe and is pursuing vibrant business interests in the country.
“On 29 November 2022 after paying US$5 000, I was accordingly awarded an investment licence which is due to expire on 28 November 2023. It was not my first licence, but a renewal of the Zimbabwe Investment Authority licence no. 004421 issued on 21 November 2018,” he said.
“I am applying for a review of the decision of the respondent which irregularly declared me a prohibited immigrant thus violating my rights and more so, affecting all my applications for further permits.”
Zheng said their woes started last year in August when he, together with Xia, legally left Botswana and presented themselves to immigration officers at Plumtree Border Post.
“It was almost 10pm as the border was about to close for the day. We received no joy as the immigration officers in Plumtree were deliberating on our passports,” he said.
Zheng said they were denied entry, arrested and declared prohibited immigrants.
“We were arrested on 10 January 2023 on charges that we were on 3 May 2023 acquitted of. Instead of being allowed to continue with our application process, the immigration department gave us three days to leave the country stating that we were prohibited immigrants,” he said.
Zheng said they have a right to reside in Zimbabwe by virtue of having been granted an investment permit.
“We have been pursuing our enterprise. Further, my wife, children and I are now domiciled in Zimbabwe as we were granted investor’s residence permit on the same applications that I made,” he said.
“I stand to suffer irreparable harm with regard to the determination of the review proceedings that are pending before this honourable court. Further, I stand to suffer great prejudice as my family is based in Zimbabwe and my deportation will disintegrate us, and it will also have a psychological effect on my wife and children.”
Zheng wants an order barring the immigration department from deporting them for the second time.
“I believe I have proven all the requirements to be satisfied in this application for an order sought to be granted.”

The EU says the bloc would consider scaling up financial assistance to Zimbabwe if Mnangagwa’s government delivers on its pledge to hold free, fair and credible elections, as well as implement reforms that would set the country’s fragile economy on a firm growth trajectory.
Despite the differences in approach, both Britain and the EU’s 28 member states have demanded a commitment to credible, peaceful, free and fair elections that are monitored by international observers.
Sources in government say although the Germans have decided to be supportive of the Mnangagwa administration, they do not want to fully endorse the regime until it fairly wins polls and ushers in tangible reforms, hence the snub.
Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel in December sent Mnangagwa a congratulatory message after his inauguration.
Merkel said: “Germany will support you as a partner in your endeavours to start a new chapter in the history of Zimbabwe — one characterised by democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.”
Government sources say the Germans want to see a tangible implementation of a number of economic, political and social reforms, given that their nationals’ investments, including farms and wildlife conservancies, protected under the Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement with Zimbabwe have over the years been grabbed.
Germany ambassador to Zimbabwe Thorsten Hutter confirmed Chinamasa failed to visit Berlin this week. He attributed the failure to transitions taking place in his country, although he admitted there were also bilateral bottlenecks to be taken care of.
“We do hope that the minister of Finance (Chinamasa) whom I had seen last Friday will indeed come to Germany soon and of course he is welcome in Germany. What I had explained is that we have a caretaker government at the moment. Tomorrow (today) the internal poll within the Social Democratic party will end and if the Social Democratic Party membership as a whole votes in favour of the grand coalition between the Socio Democrats and the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union then within the next two or three weeks a new government will be formed,” said Hutter.
“But at the moment we only have a caretaker government so we thought that the timing was not right. Indeed there are some bilateral issues that we thought should be resolved before the visit. I hope that is something that we will be able to sort out in the coming days.”
Germany has the largest national economy in Europe, the fourth-largest by nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the world after United States in America, China and Japan, and fifth by GDP (purchasing power parity). It surpasses Britain which is in the process of pulling out of the EU through its controversial Brexit process.
Other super powers like the US have also been cautious with Zimbabwe. The US recently extended its targeted sanctions with the possibility of a review after the general elections expected later this year.

Xie Zheng is yet to appear in court facing charges of staying in the country illegally and that of trying to shoot at the immigration officers.
Principal Immigration Officer Mrs Patricia Mafodya yesterday said Xie recently had his urgent chamber application dismissed at the High Court when he was challenging his arrest and detention.
“He then lodged an appeal at the Magistrates’ Court against his deeming as a prohibited immigrant, but withdrew at the hearing,” she said.
Xie had his Star pistol, which had five rounds of ammunition, recently taken away for further investigations and to ascertain if it was licenced.
He came to Zimbabwe sometime last month and was issued with a holiday visa, but continued staying in the country after it expired.
Immigration officers went to his flat to check on his status and asked Xie to produce his permit, but he threatened to shoot them.
Meanwhile, a Nigerian national Cletus Chukwuka Anueyiangu, who recently had his case dismissed at the Supreme Court after he challenged both his arrest and conviction, has been deported.
Anueyiangu and his wife were deported last Thursday.
Anueyiangu was recently arrested in the city after being found without the required documents to stay in the country.
He entered into the country sometime in 2004 on a holiday before he went back to his country.
He attempted to enter the country on 7 May, 2005, but was equivocally denied entry.
It is believed that Anueyiangu then sneaked into the country, but was arrested and deported on June 15, 2005.
He sneaked into the country again using fake names and another Nigerian passport.
In 2006, Anueyiangu and two other Nigerians applied for and were issued with a Zimbabwe Investment Licence and they formed a company called Ideal Clothing Manufacturing based at the Gulf Complex.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'USA': ['Gulf']}",diplomatic_sanction,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese']

BY TATIRA ZWINOIRA
China was placed under Category B of countries, whose nationals apply for visas upon entry into Zimbabwe.
Speaking at a Press conference in Harare yesterday, immigration department principal director Clemence Masango said there were, however, conditions Chinese nationals have to meet before being granted visas.
“The eligibility for Chinese nationals is that only Chinese tourists travelling as a group (two or more people) cleared by tour operators and travel agencies in China can qualify. Chinese business persons and other citizens of China as approved by their government will continue to apply for visas online,” Masango said.
“Zimbabwe is removing all visa controls in respect of Sadc countries in line with and fulfilment of the spirit and objectives of the Sadc protocol on the facilitation of the movement of persons.”
Thirty-seven countries, including China, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Algeria, Turkey and Cuba, were moved from Category C to Category B under the new measures announced yesterday.
A measly 6 000 Chinese tourists visited Zimbabwe last year, the worst in the region, as Botswana had an estimated
43 000, Zambia 55 000 and South Africa 158 000, to name a few.
The visa regime consists of three categories A, B and C.
Under category A, foreign nationals are exempt from visa requirements, B states that visas must be obtained upon entry and C requires nationals to apply for visas prior to travel.
Chinese Federation of Zimbabwe deputy president Steve Zhao said the new visa regime was a positive step.

Zimbabwe,4123,zimbabwesituation.com,2015-05-07T10:55:25Z,Aid framework under review - Chinamasa,"FINANCE minister Patrick Chinamasa has said the government will review the aid co-ordination architecture to ensure that aid flows effectively in the country.
Speaking at a stakeholders meeting on review of Aid Co-ordination Architecture in Harare yesterday, Chinamasa said there was need to ensure transparency in the way aid was channelled and used.
“The government recognises the shortfalls and constraints in the existing institutional framework for aid co-ordination and is committed to reviewing the aid co-ordination architecture,” he said.
“This effort is to make us move in a transparent manner in terms of the way that aid assistance is channelled and the purposes to which that aid is being used.”
Chinamasa said development assistance played a crucial role in attaining socioeconomic development as enshrined in ZimAsset.
“A well-co-ordinated and effectively managed external assistance framework is of vital importance in complementing government efforts to realise Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socioeconomic Transformation objectives,” he said.
“We desire that all grant flows are channelled towards supporting the achievement of our national priorities, as articulated in our National Development Plan.”
Chinamasa said the government could not guarantee that there would be no abuse.
“But at least under this undertaking, if there is abuse we will not hesitate to take the steps necessary to bring those responsible to book,” he said.
“On our part, when the development assistance is received by us, we have an obligation to say thank you because it fills a financing gap. But as I have said before, I cannot say thank you if I don’t know where the assistance has gone, whether it has arrived, if we need it or if it is playing a transformative role in the economy.”
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) resident co-ordinator Bishow Parajuli said the absence of a well-functioning development co-operation mechanism not only prevented the realisation of enabling factors for development, but also constrained the government’s ability to ensure alignment of donor resources to national priorities.
“A structured government-led dialogue among stakeholders, including the government, donors, civil society and the private sector, could greatly promote transparency, build trust among the stakeholders and reduce the potential for misunderstandings over strategies, policies and actions,” Parajuli said.
He acknowledged that Zimbabwe was experiencing challenges that included a liquidity crisis, decline in the manufacturing sector as well as a very tight fiscal space.
“The tight fiscal space has serious negative spillover effects on public service delivery and its consequences on people’s health, education support and promotion of agriculture, employment and overall poverty,” Parajuli said.",0,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'USA': ['United States']}",economic_aid_assistance,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']
Zimbabwe,10819,newsday.co.zw,2019-09-02T00:00:00Z,‘No strings attached to Chinese aid’,"CHINESE ambassador to Zimbabwe, Guo Shaochun, says his country respects the rights of African countries, including Zimbabwe and their quest for development and vowed his country will never attach political strings to assistance advanced to Africa.
BY WINSTONE ANTONIO
Shaochun made the remarks in his address at this year’s edition of the Dreamstar Talent Search national finals at the Harare International Conference Centre on Saturday.
“The China-Africa relationship is deeply rooted in our common quest for liberation, justice and independence. We have never attached any political conditions for assistance to Africa. This is our basic principle,” he said.
“We, as the Chinese Embassy, highly-appreciate the cordial relations and co-operation that exist between China and Zimbabwe. This relationship dates back to the days of the liberation struggle when China fully supported the national independence of Zimbabwe. Since then, we have come a long way.”
Shaochun said like many African countries, China has had the bitter experience of having its economy controlled by foreign powers and being subjected to unjust treatment, exploitation and oppression.
“Over the past 70 years, China has grown into the second largest economy in the world, contributing over 30% annually to the global economic growth. China is not growing alone as it is fostering good relations and co-operation with African countries under the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation and the Belt and Road Initiative for the mutual benefit of China and African countries, including Zimbabwe,” he said.
He said China was now the largest trading country in goods and largest holder of foreign exchange reserves in the world, with 740 million people having been lifted out of poverty in China.
“In the coming 15 years, China plans to import 24 trillion United States dollars in goods, open up a two-trillion-dollar market to foreign investors and invest US$750 billion overseas, while Chinese tourists will make more than two billion overseas visits,” he said.

The Chinese government will donate rice worth $24,6 million to support Government in distributing food to areas which have been severely hit by the El Nino-induced drought this cropping season.
Speaking during the second consultative meeting to update on the country’s status on food, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Cde Huang Ping said China will do its best to assist Zimbabwe during this drought season.
“The Chinese government and people attach great importance to the recent severe drought and famine in Zimbabwe and sympathise with the suffering of the affected people.
“In this regard, the Chinese government decided to provide rice as emergency food aid worthy of 160 million yuan (approximately $24.6 million) in grant to Zimbabwe, implementing President Xi Jinping’s commitment at the FOCAC Johannesburg summit that in the next three years, the Chinese side would provide one billion yuan in emergency food aid to African countries,” he said.
Zimbabwe currently requires 700 000 tonnes of maize while Government has placed orders for grain totalling 469 000 tonnes from different countries.
“Currently, China is working closely with relevant departments of the Zimbabwean side to ensure food aid arrives in the disaster areas as soon as possible, and to help alleviate the famine in the country.
“I believe, with the help of the international community, the Zimbabwean government and people will overcome the difficulties,” he said.
In recent years, the Chinese government has provided five batches of emergency humanitarian food aid to Zimbabwe, including 7 500 tonnes of maize in 2002 and 2006 in two batches, 4 000 tonnes of soyabeans in 2007, emergency food assistance worth 90 million yuan in 2011 and rice worth 50 million yuan in 2014.

THE Chinese government has pledged to provide food aid to Zimbabwe among other regional countries that are facing an El Nino induced drought.
Due to El Nino weather conditions, the country received insignificant rains this year, a development that will result in most communities not harvesting anything.
As a result of the looming drought, President Mnangagwa earlier this month declared the farming season a State of Disaster and the Government requires US$2 billion for food aid to vulnerable households.
The Government has called upon local and international partners to chip in to support those who would be food insecure.
Zimbabwe is not the only country that is staring at a serious drought with Zambia and Malawi also declaring a state of disaster.
China is among the first countries to respond to the State of Disaster call and has pledged to provide food aid to Zimbabwe among other regional countries.
“China has been closely following the recent severe droughts and food shortages in southern Africa. We are collecting and preparing emergency food assistance to over 20 African countries such as Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia,” Chinese government foreign ministry spokesperson, Ms Mao Ning, said in a statement.
“We will seek to provide more food aid to the best of our capabilities in the future in light of the developments on the ground and the needs of relevant countries.”
She said this is part of the China-Africa relations, which also observe the importance of agriculture and food security.

China yesterday donated 1 050 tonnes of rice and 1 050 tonnes of flour to the Government of Zimbabwe which will go towards the welfare of the vulnerable communities as the two nations continue to enjoy cordial relations.
The donation, which was received by Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Paul Mavima will primarily benefit the elderly, the chronically ill, people with disabilities, child headed families, victims of disasters, registered institutions housing vulnerable children and other vulnerable groups.
It was all smiles when some of the registered charitable organizations, including Hupenyu Hutsva Children’s Home, Chinyaradzo Children’s Home, and Society of Destitute Aged, received one ton each of rice and flour as part of their share.
Speaking after receiving the consignment at Grain Marketing Board Aspindale, Minister Mavima said the Chinese gesture would go a long way in complementing Government efforts of alleviating hunger in line with vision 2030. “As evidenced by this gathering, we strive to have an inclusive society where all basic services and needs are accessible to all, from our children to the elderly and the previous marginalised community groups like persons with disabilities, women and girls.
“As the Government of Zimbabwe awaits the release of the results of the 2023 Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee, which guides the implementation of the Food Deficit Mitigation Strategy, this donation will go a long way in complementing Government efforts of alleviating hunger as it responds to distress calls for food assistance across the country in the spirit of making sure no one goes hungry in our great nation,” he said.
Prof Mavima said they would continue to mobilise for the poor and vulnerable citizens.
Additionally, he thanked the Chinese government for its ongoing assistance.
The Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe, his Excellency Zhou Ding pledged to continue supporting the Government creating a self-sufficient and food surplus economy.
“Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed that China will continue to work with all countries in a spirit of solidarity and shared future to advance the Global Development Initiative, and scale up cooperation on food security and poverty reduction,” he said.
Further Mr Ding said the donation once again demonstrated the two countries’ common aspirations in pursuing food security.
“Under the strategic guidance of President Xi Jinping and President Mnangagwa, friendly cooperation between China and Zimbabwe has been making new progress and yielding new fruits.
“The national anthem of Zimbabwe has a line that says, ‘May rain abound, and fertile fields; May we be fed, our labour blessed. Similarly, we in China have a proverb which goes, food is a paramount necessity for the people. This reflects that our peoples share common views on food security.”

Zimbabwe,4476,newsday.co.zw,2015-08-08T00:00:00Z,Part of Chinese loan to Harare goes missing,"HARARE mayor Bernard Manyenyeni has alleged $3 million is missing from the $144 million Chinese loan extended for the refurbishment of Morton Jaffray waterworks, saying investigations should be carried out to determine how the money disappeared.
BY MOSES MATENGA
This came as the Chinese company refurbishing the plant complained to Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere that out of the $144 million, they had only been given $72 million, slowing progress of the project.
Speaking during Kasukuwere’s familiarisation tour of Morton Jaffray yesterday, Manyenyeni said contractors were given $69 million, hence the need to account for the remaining $3 million.
He argued that the amount pumped into the project and work on the ground were not tallying.
“Three million dollars is a big gap and we will sit and see where the difference is. We will also see what can be done to have the remainder released,” Manyenyeni said.
“They are saying $69 million is for preliminary work, but it’s too much to be dubbed preliminary work.”
A project official representing Chinese contractors Cao Yang said he had received $72 million and was waiting for the remainder to fast track the project.
“I have received only $72 million, that is 50%, and the procedure is that council is supposed to push the Ministry of Finance to have the funds released, but since 2013, l have not received anything,” he said.
“The project is 42% complete. In October, all the major equipment will be shipped and by end of year, all things will be in place.”
Manyenyeni, however, argued that the attribution of $69 million to “preliminary work” was not justifiable and proposed a meeting with the Chinese to discuss the matter.
Kasukuwere said a lot of work had been done given that a lot of suburbs now had water regularly.
“Quite a lot of progress has been made. Some suburbs that had not received water for some time are receiving water now,” Kasukuwere said.
The $144 million deal has been a subject of controversy with reports of inflating of prices and abuse of funds by council management led by suspended town clerk Tendai Mahachi.
The managers bought themselves luxury cars worth millions of dollars.

The Red Cross Society of China also donated $50 000, while the Chinese Community in Zimbabwe and the embassy contributed a further $10 000.
Speaking at the handover ceremony of the donations, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Huang Ping said his country was Zimbabwe’s all-weather friend and was ready to render support in times of need.
“Our friendship dates back to the time of the liberation struggle and in all those years we have developed the relationship into an all-weather friendship,” he said.
“I think the most important thing is to render help in times of need. Good friends render help in times of need.
“Last year, when Zimbabwe suffered drought, my Government reacted by sending 20 000 tonnes of rice and 10 000 tonnes of fertiliser to empower Zimbabwe’s agriculture to develop.”
Namibia Ambassador to Zimbabwe Ms Balbina Daes Pienaar said Zimbabweans and Namibians were brothers.
“As a sister nation, Namibia has heard the plea of Zimbabwe for humanitarian assistance in empathy,” she said.
“We felt it equally and duty bound to take action because actions speak louder than words.
“Namibia has not only made a pledge, but arrived to deliver a consignment of 1,2 million canned horse mackerel fish. The consignment was transported all the way from our port City Walvis Bay to the Sunshine City of Harare in 14 trucks that travelled over 2 000 kilometres via the Trans Kalahari Highway through Plumtree Border Post.”
Acting Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Minister Sydney Sekeramayi expressed gratitude to China and Namibia for heeding Zimbabwe’s plea for assistance.
“Indeed, many lives were lost and damage has been widespread,” he said. “It is assistance which is going to be put to good use by the people who were heavily affected by the floods and (Chinese) ambassador, I want to assure you that the money that you have donated will be put to good use,” he said.
“We are so grateful to the Namibians for exploiting their natural resource to the benefit of the people of Zimbabwe.
“During these times, food and medicines are in short supply. The magnanimous gesture is an embodiment of the good neighbourliness and a reflection of our unique African tradition of Ubuntu.”

The embassy said that its figure also did not include other forms of financial support, such as the cost of providing expert help and donations made by the mission itself to local groups.
It urged the Zimbabwean government to “make a comprehensive assessment of the bilateral support figures and accurately reflect the actual situation when formulating the budget statement”.
The embassy said it understood “bilateral development support” to include funding for cooperative projects, cash and the value of donated goods.
Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting responded by saying it was holding talks with Chinese officials.
“The government has noted the query raised by the Chinese embassy regarding aid figures … [and] consultations are under way to establish a common accounting position,” it said.
According to Ncube’s presentation, the United States and Britain were the biggest donors in the nine-month period – each providing US$50 million, followed by the European Union (US$41 million), Japan (US$14.2 million), Switzerland (US$6.4 million) and India (US$500,000).
Most of the funding from Western nations came via charities, it said.
Both the US and EU have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe over allegations of government corruption but Beijing has repeatedly backed Harare’s call to have the sanctions lifted.
And while the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have been reluctant to provide financial aid to Zimbabwe, figures from the China Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington show that China extended more than US$2.2 billion worth of loans to Zimbabwe between 2000 and 2017.

The discrepancy in the latest figures is likely to raise questions in Harare, especially from opposition politicians who have accused the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front of misreporting its debts and accepting foreign loans without parliament’s approval.

The funds will be directed towards the country’s post-disaster recovery, targeting among others health and education facilities that were damaged by the tropical storm.
Cyclone Idai caused catastrophic damage in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi.
The Zimbabwean government reported at least 299 deaths following the occurrence of the cyclone.
It is estimated that 250,000 people were affected by the floods in nine districts in the southeastern regions of Zimbabwe, with Chimanimani and Chipinge being the most affected.
The recovery program, which will be implemented over a 12-month period, is funded by the Chinese government under the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund (SSCAF) which aims to support developing countries’ implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Speaking at the official launch of the project on Post Disaster Recovery Assistance After Cyclone Idai on Friday, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Guo Shaochun said through the SSCAF that China remains committed to assisting the victims of Cyclone Idai in Zimbabwe.

CHINA will soon avail more assistance to Zimbabwe in agriculture, energy, health and science and technology sectors, the country’s Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Guo Shaochun, said yesterday.
Addressing Zimbabwean diplomats during a tour of the new Parliament building in Mt Hampden built using a US$98 million grant from the Chinese Government under China-aid, Ambassador Guo said more assistance would be announced soon.
“Your Excellencies, we are going to witness more programmes in our co-operation in the coming days. More China-aid Covid-19 vaccines will be delivered very soon. We are going to receive another batch of Chinese agricultural experts to Zimbabwe and continue to build agricultural demonstration villages.
“Another 300 boreholes, Phase II of High-Performance Computing Centre, anti-narcotics laboratory and other China-aid projects will be commissioned. Bilateral co-operation in agriculture, clean energy and high technology will be discussed,” he said.
China has provided support to Zimbabwe in several areas that include Kariba South Hydro-electric Power Station extension, the expansion of Hwange Thermal Power Station by two new units, and Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport expansion.
Ambassador Guo reaffirmed his country’s support to Zimbabwe.
“Your Excellencies, standing at a new historical starting point, China will always follow the principles of peace, development, co-operation and win-win results to deepen pragmatic co-operation with Zimbabwe,” he said.
“China will firmly support Zimbabwe in pursuing an independent development path which is suitable to its national conditions so as to realise its 2030 Vision at an early date. China stands ready to work with Zimbabwe to further promote our bilateral co-operation and tap into the potential of common prosperity.”
Ambassador Guo expressed satisfaction at the progress Zimbabwe has achieved in implementing National Development Strategy 1 to realise Vision 2030 of becoming an upper middle-income economy.
The New Parliament building, the largest China-aid project in southern Africa, will transform for the better the physical conditions in which the will of the Zimbabwean people is exercised.
In a speech read on his behalf, Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs and International Trade Ambassador James Manzou thanked China for its continued support of Zimbabwe.

Zimbabwe,5842,newsday.co.zw,2016-03-11T00:00:00Z,Zim mending relations with IMF: Chinamasa,"ZIMBABWE has set a good record through the completion of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) supervised economic reform plan which is a preparatory work for better programmes.
BY VICTORIA MTOMBA
Zimbabwe has been under the IMF Staff Monitored Programme since 2014. A final review of the SMP recently showed that the country had met the benchmarks set.
Speaking at the IMF breakfast meeting yesterday the Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa said the country has been working on reforms to improve itself. He said the relationship between government and the IMF had not been good because of the arrears and the debt issue.
“We now have a good record. We are not there yet, we are only there to discuss a new financial programme,” he said. Chinamasa said when a customer to a bank fails to service the debt, the bank would want to know if one has the capacity to repay for the new loan.
He said everyone needed to reform, but it is not a one-day wonder, but a process.
“We have to enter into skirmishes and they are at policy level and you will have to fight battles and in implementation changing people’s habits is not easy,” he said.
Chinamasa said the government is now working on a draft country financing programme although it has not yet been taken to Cabinet.
“We are working on a Draft Country Financing Programme and it has not yet been taken to Cabinet. It will turn the economic fortunes of our country,” he said.
The programme will focus on agriculture and mining as the main sectors of the economy.
The head of IMF delegation Domenico Fanizza said the country cannot wait any longer as it had the best human capital than the rest of the world and it is difficult to understand how in the past 15 years it has not been performing well.
Fanizza said the country has completed preparatory work and now the ball is now in Zimbabwe’s court.
“Zimbabwe has capacity to get to the finishing line,” he said.
The IMF team came to Zimbabwe for two weeks for Article IV and the review of the SMP.
Speaking on the sidelines of the IMF breakfast meeting yesterday, Central Bank governor John Mangudya, said the International Finance Corporation team is in the country to assess how they can assist the country.

Zimbabwe,9904,zimbabwesituation.com,2018-09-28T14:49:15Z,Harare banks on Beijing bailout,"PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administration sees China as the brightest hopes in its quest for a critical US$2 billion bailout package to ease the country’s crippling liquidity crunch and cash crisis. Official sources say Harare will once again resuscitate negotiations after hitting a brick wall during meetings held on the sidelines of the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation (Focac) summit in Beijing at the beginning of the month.
Owen Gagare
A Chinese embassy official confirmed that embassy officials would meet Finance minister Mthuli Ncube “after 7 October” to discuss future loans and the bottlenecks which have prevented Beijing from advancing more loans.
The meeting will lay the groundwork for more discussions.
Finance ministry and Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe officials have for some time been negotiating for a loan from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the Export-Import Bank of China, but a breakthrough has been slow in coming because the Chinese remain worried about Harare’s ability to repay loans.
The major bottleneck during Mnangagwa’s visit was the failure by Zimbabwean officials to demonstrate capacity and willingness to settle arrears from previous loans.
Zimbabwe has arrears of about US$300 million from previous Chinese loans.
The Chinese are, however, optimistic that Ncube will be able to come up with bankable plans as well as devise a payment strategy to unlock new lines of credit from the Asian giant.
“The Finance minister is in New York. When he comes back, we will meet with him and we can have a discussion on these issues. We hope that we will achieve some progress on the issue of the loans and we have to do it step-by-step. We won’t force the Zimbabwean government to pay it now, but we will have a detailed and frank discussion about it,” said a Chinese embassy official.
“We hope that the Zimbabwean government will pay back the loans. This will clear all the obstacles for more future funding. Thereafter, we hope they will come up with bankable projects that will enable Zimbabwe to get more loans and be able to repay. Now we have US$60 billion for Africa and we hope the Zimbabwean government clears arrears so that the country can also benefit from that facility.
“We are looking forward to a good discussion with the Finance minister. The Finance minister is a very good professional with good connections and he knows how the economy works. We hope he could help reverse the trend.”
The official said China wanted to help Zimbabwe as demonstrated by the availing of funds for the Kariba South Extension project, Hwange thermal power station project, Robert Mugabe International Airport and the Victoria Falls International Airport despite Harare’s failure to repay previous loans.
The funds were unlocked during Mnangagwa’s visit in April.
The initial agreement for the Hwange Power Station deal was signed in August 2014 when former president Robert Mugabe visited the world’s second largest economy.
However, insurance firm Sinosure refused to guarantee loans from Chinese banks to Zimbabwean companies, including a loan meant for the expansion of the power station because of the government’s failure to repay arrears.
The impasse has persisted because Zimbabwe still owes US$160 million to China Exim Bank and Sinosure.
Special agreements were, however, made on the Hwange thermal project and the Robert Mugabe International Airport, and the Victoria Falls International Airport in line with the elevation of relations from all-weather friends to strategic partners.
China also extended a US$500 million loan for the Kariba South Extension programme.
“We cannot forget the fact that in April when President Mnangagwa visited China we made special arrangements and although they have not paid back the loans, we still made special arrangements for them to get loans for those special projects. But those are special favours; you cannot expect every time to have special arrangements. We have to follow the rules of the markets,” said the official.
“What should be done is that if you secure loans, you put them to good use such as invest in infrastructure and you develop the economy. If you borrow loans and you squander the money on consumption, and you have no projects and the economy does not develop, that is terrible. Good investments will mean that you are able to repay the loans.”
Zimbabwe is desperate for funds and has for some time also been engaging British multinational bank Standard Chartered Plc and other institutions to help raise US$1,8 billion to clear arrears to multi-lateral institutions under the Lima Plan, to enable the country to secure US$2 billion in fresh funding.
This followed the presentation of an arrears clearance plan to its creditors in Lima, Peru, in 2015, which was anchored on several financial sector and structural reforms, that have largely not been implemented.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'PER': ['Republic of Peru'], 'USA': ['New York', 'Lima']}",economic_aid_assistance,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Zimbabwe,6949,newsday.co.zw,2016-10-06T00:00:00Z,Chinamasa owes govt $19 000 in loan arrears,"FINANCE minister Patrick Chinamasa reportedly owes the government $19 000, which was advanced to him as a loan during his tenure as Justice minister, Parliament has been told.
BY VENERANDA LANGA
A report by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Public Accounts, which was presented to the National Assembly on Tuesday, said since 2010, staff in the Justice ministry had accrued outstanding travel and subsistence advances of $507 829.
The report, presented by committee chairperson, Paurina Mpariwa, said the ministry had been failing to recover the advances in violation of Treasury Instruction 1505.
“The ministry only managed to recover $22 489 in 2014 and the secretary, Virginia Mabhiza, acknowledged the observation and confirmed that no recoveries were instituted from 2010 until when she joined the ministry in 2013,” the report read.
“A schedule submitted to the committee showed that some deductions commenced in April 2016 for 76 officials out of a total of 441, with varying outstanding advances, and when the ministry appeared before the committee, the accounting officer gave an impression that deductions were effected on every owing officer, yet further written submissions showed that it was only a handful.”
The report added: “She (Mabhiza) also highlighted that deductions were increased from $50 to between $100 and $500 depending on the level of the official. Evidence presented showed that only one individual, with an outstanding amount of $2 360 had his or her deduction pegged at $100. The rest were contributing less than $100. Surprisingly, a sample of those owing huge amounts showed that deductions were not yet effected.”
The list of other Justice miistry officials with outstanding amounts also revealed that one S Zambada owed $18 339, W Nyambuya ($18 033), M Zakeyo ($16 225), V Nguruve ($13 746), T Chigumadzi ($13 415), H Gadzai ($12 204) and S Suntile ($10 371).
Eighteen other officials owed amounts ranging between $5 000 and $9 000.
“The committee noted with concern, that there was laxity in recovering the outstanding advances by the ministry. At the current rate of recovery, it will take the ministry forever to recover the outstanding advances.
“It, therefore, recommends the ministry to effect realistic deductions ranging from $100 to $500 for every individual owing, taking into account the outstanding amount and the grade,” the report reads.
Parliament also ordered disciplinary action to be taken against the ministry’s former finance director, whose name was not mentioned, for instructing the Salary Services Bureau to cease deductions of the outstanding allowances from the debtors’ salaries.

Zimbabwe,2110,zimbabwesituation.com,2014-03-05T15:03:06Z,China donates US$500k for flood victims | The Herald,"China has donated half a million dollars cash towards the Tokwe-Mukosi disaster as bilateral relations between the Asian country and Zimbabwe continue to grow.
The announcement was made by visiting member of the Foreign Policy Advisory Group (Ministry of Foreign Affiars) Mr Ji Peiding after meeting Vice President Joice Mujuru at her Munhumutapa offices in Harare yesterday. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Ji called for the strengthening of economic ties between Zimbabwe and China.
“Recently Zimbabwe had floods somewhere and our ambassador here Mr Lin Lin today conveyed the donation from the Chinese of US$500 000 in cash to the disaster,” he said.
“We are looking towards strengthening the economic relations between the countries and to invest in this beautiful country.”
Government is relocating the affected families from Tokwe-Mukosi to Chingwizi holding camp.
Mr Ji said he had “an interesting” discussion with VP Mujuru.
He said it was pleasing to note that there was political stability in Zimbabwe and the country was now concentrating on economic development.
“I had great honour to have an interesting discussion with the Vice President. I told the deputy president that it is a home-coming visit.
“I worked in Zimbabwe for five years during the 1980s at the embassy. I am very happy to see that Zimbabwe now enjoys political stability and is ready for the next economic takeoff.”
Mr Ji said China would continue supporting Zimbabwe.
“We also discussed about bilateral relations between the two countries and China is promising to assist further because we are good brothers and sisters.”
In response, VP Mujuru said the people in Chingwizi needed aid especially food and clothing.
“Take our message to the President His Excellency Xi Jinping that we are very grateful to the gesture.

Zimbabwe,5146,zimbabwesituation.com,2015-11-25T09:40:55Z,China set to pledge more aid to Africa ahead of Xi's trip,"China is set to announce new aid to African nations when President Xi Jinping visits Zimbabwe and South Africa next month, a senior Chinese official said on Wednesday.
Reuters
The trip is likely to boost China’s relations with Africa, which supplies oil and raw materials such as copper and uranium to the world’s second-largest economy.
China is Africa’s largest trading partner and the trade volume between them amounted to $220 billion in 2014, according to China state news agency Xinhua.
Zhang Ming, one of China’s vice foreign minister, said President Xi will provide further details in his keynote speech on Dec 4.
“As for whether China will continue to provide support and aid, there will be no doubt about it,” Zhang said, declining to provide further details on the aid amount and its purpose.
Xi is scheduled to meet Zimbabwe’s 91-year-old President Robert Mugabe on December 1-2, Zhang said. He will also meet South Africa’s President Jacob Zuma on December 2-3 and co-chair a two-day summit between China and African countries in Johannesburg after the meeting.
The summit in December will be the second such high-level forum following one held in Beijing in 2006, Zhang said.
“This African trip by President Xi Jinping will be the most important, comprehensive and valuable visit in recent years,” Zhang said.
Xi visited Africa in 2013 shortly after he took office as president. Mugabe reciprocated with a visit to China in 2014 in an attempt to seek loans and investments to lift Zimbabwe’s struggling economy.
Beijing’s focus on growing trade and aid in Africa leaves it open to charges by the West of turning a blind eye to conflicts and rights abuses in the continent.
Trade with resource-rich Africa has exploded in the last decade as China feeds its industrial machine amid African demand for cheap Chinese products.
The EU has rejected what they call China’s “cheque book” approach to doing business with Africa, saying it would continue to demand good governance and the transparent use of funds from its trading partners.
Chinese firms in Africa also face criticism for using imported labour to build government-financed projects like roads and hospitals, while pumping out raw resources and processing them in China, leaving little for local economies.
China’s friendship with Africa dates back to the 1950s, when Beijing backed liberation movements in the continent fighting to throw off Western colonial rule.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa', 'Johannesburg']}",economic_aid_assistance,"['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Xi Jinping', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Zimbabwe,2517,zimbabwesituation.com,2014-06-19T11:29:56Z,China commits to funding Zim-Asset,"China has reiterated its commitment to assist financially within the purview of the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation. In a meeting with Vice President Joice Mujuru in Harare yesterday, China’s Vice President Dr Li Yuanchao said Beijing wanted to see Zimbabwe prosper.
Dr Li met VP Mujuru during a stopover at the Harare International Airport en-route to Zambia for a four-day State visit.
At the airport he met VP Mujuru, Foreign Affairs Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi, Minister of State for Harare Province Miriam Chikukwa and Minister of State in the VP’s Office Sylvester Nguni.
An initial funding commitment for Zim-Asset was made by China’s Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Lin Lin last month when he said discussions for a financial package were underway.
“We are very proud to see your achievements and we will do our best for you to realise this feat,” said Dr Li.
“Our two countries enjoy very good relations, especially in terms of economic co-operation.”
Dr Li, who is also a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, informed VP Mujuru that Beijing was preparing for President Mugabe’s visit to China later this year.
He described Zimbabwe as one of China’s best friends, adding that the CPC and Zanu-PF had a long-standing relationship dating back to the days of the liberation struggle.
Dr Li, who is leading a 21-member delegation including senior Chinese government CPC officials, said Zimbabwe was making strides on the economic front and Beijing was ready to assist in the area of training.
VP Mujuru said Zimbabwe was ready to work with China in implementing Zim-Asset.
“There is a lot that we feel China can also try to look at and work with us so that this blueprint becomes a reality because it is a programme that the generality of this country is looking forward to,” she said.
“For years since independence, we have been failing to deliver fully . . . yes we got the land, but the land has not given the full results which the Head of State and our party and his people are waiting to see.”
VP Mujuru said Zimbabwe appreciated China’s support during and after the liberation struggle.

Zimbabwe,4000,zimbabwesituation.com,2015-04-20T05:50:04Z,Chinese firm externalises US$500m,"CHINESE diamond mining firm, Jinan Mining, is under investigations for allegedly externalising close to half a billion dollars, which it later brought back into the country as investment capital, the Financial Gazette reports.
Jinan is one of the eight companies operating in Chiadzwa, a ward in Mutare District, which is home to controversial Marange diamonds. The fraud, now under investigation by the police, involves BancABC, which is said to have facilitated the transaction and failed to inform the central bank about the movement of the cash outside the country.
BancABC is the commercial banking unit of ABC Holdings, dually listed on the Botswana and Zimbabwe stock exchanges until February this year. ABC Holdings was recently bought by former Barclays Plc chief executive officer, Bob Diamond, through his Atlas Mara investment vehicle which he jointly controls with African billionaire Ashish Thakkar.
Well-placed sources said Jinan externalised US$546 million through the bank, then routed it back as investment. Jinan is said to have donated US$100 million to the Zimbabwe National Defence College but transferred about US$446 million to Botswana without exchange control approval from the central bank.
A source familiar with the transaction revealed that this money was proceeds from diamonds mined in Chiadzwa. It is understood that BancABC undermined the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), which is battling to curb illicit financial transactions, by facilitating this transaction.
In fact, the RBZ has not liberalised capital accounts, meaning that BancABC’s failure to advise the central bank about the illegal transaction may have been in violation of standing regulations.
This was also not in line with best practice in mitigating incidences of externalisation.
Although no comment could be obtained from the RBZ governor, John Mangudya, or his deputies, Kupukile Mlambo and Charity Dhliwayo, the Financial Gazette has it on good authority that the central bank is seized with the matter.
The RBZ has reported the fraudulent transaction by the Chinese company to the police, who are said to be investigating the issue.
BancABC Zimbabwe managing director, Joe Sibanda, declined to comment when contacted, citing client confidentiality.
“Jinan is a customer with the bank so I can’t discuss the issue with a third party without their (Jinan) authority,” said Sibanda.
Jinan’s deputy managing director, Tapiwa Goronga confirmed the police investigations but declined to give details.
“I can’t comment on issues under police and RBZ investigations. All I can say is that let the law take its course,” said Goronga.
Police spokesperson, Charity Charamba, whom the Financial Gazette has sought comment from for the past three weeks, only said on Tuesday: “I need time to check with our departments and will come back to you.”
She had not done so by the time of going to print.
Presenting his 2015 monetary policy statement early this year, Mangudya expressed grave concern over illicit financial transactions.
“The RBZ is seriously concerned by the abuse of individual or personal accounts to externalise business earnings under the pretext of free funds, thereby circumventing or evading taxes,” he said.
“This practice of promoting illicit financial flows is counter-productive and should be stopped. The RBZ has no intention to put impediments on the conduct of free funds accounts but we cannot also remain naive at the wanton abuse of the liberalised facility by a few nationalities.”
“Accordingly, the RBZ would like to remind the banking public to adhere to good principles in conducting transactions in their free funds accounts and for banks to continuously exercise and conduct customer due diligence or to adhere to the know your customer principles at all times.”
Jinan’s case highlights long-held fears that diamond mining companies in Chiadzwa have been looting resources, depriving the country of meaningful revenue in the form of taxes and dividends in the case of firms jointly held by government.
Indeed, there has been no transparency in the handling of diamond proceeds by miners operating in Chiadzwa diamonds fields.
Most of the country’s diamond revenues have reportedly been unaccounted for, and leakages are said to be rampant, with individuals benefiting at the expense of the nation.
The Minister of Mines and Mining Development, Walter Chidhakwa, has equally been perturbed by the development, and is mulling consolidation of all diamond mining companies in Marange to promote transparency.
But critics argue that firms in the alluvial diamonds-rich area were allowed to operate with impunity, with politicians deliberately allowing the looting of diamonds because they personally benefitted from the vice.
Former finance minister, Tendai Biti, called for transparency in the operations of diamond mining firms in Chiadzwa, but was rebuffed by his colleagues in the then-coalition government who said lack of transparency was a deliberate strategy to conceal Zimbabwe’s operations which were meant to bust illegal sanctions imposed on the country by the West.
But incumbent Finance Minister, Patrick Chinamasa, himself a ZANU-PF politburo member, has begun squirming from the deprivation of resources to Treasury by the diamond mining firms and has called for transparency.
There are several companies mining diamonds in Chiadzwa, including Mbada Diamonds, Marange Resources, Anjin Investments (which is jointly owned by the Chinese military and their Zimbabwean counterparts), Diamond Mining Company, Jinan, Rera, Kusena and Gye Nyame.
Recently, these diamond mining companies said they have hit a hard rock and that alluvial deposits had been depleted.
But several reports suggest that they have accelerated looting at the fields ahead of the planned amalgamation of operations.

Zimbabwe,3097,zimbabwesituation.com,2014-09-17T14:01:02Z,"Our friends are here, Bob tells 'evil' West","“OUR greatest friends are here”, President Robert told the West Tuesday as he met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov who was in Zimbabwe to commission a US$3 billion platinum mining project – the largest single foreign investment in the country.
Mugabe met Lavrov at his Zvimba rural home and the Russian diplomat, clearly aware of his host’s abiding vanities, massaged Mugabe’s ego by calling him “a legend, a historical figure”.
Indeed, it has been a good couple of weeks for Mugabe. The visit by a top Russian minister came after the Zimbabwean leader returned from China where he was assured of funding for massive infrastructure development projects he hopes will help fire the country’s struggling economy.
Speaking at a press briefing with Lavrov Tuesday, Mugabe said: “This act (platinum deal) we say to our people, our greatest friends here they are. Yesterday, I was in Beijing, again there to get our greatest friends to work with us today.
“These are the two main pillars of support of our revolution yesterday and they remain the two pillars of our support in international law and so we say to them Great thanks for standing with us in perpetuity …”
The Zanu PF leader has been actively courting China and, now Russia, both key supporters of the country’s liberation struggle after falling out with former admirers and financial backers in the West.
Zimbabwe was in 2002 slapped with devastating sanctions by the West allegedly over concerns about electoral fraud and human rights abuses, allegations denied by Mugabe who insists the measures were aimed at forcing him out of power because of his controversial land reforms.
The sanctions helped trigger a decade-long economic crisis and came close to forcing Mugabe out of power in 2008 when he lost the first round of the presidential ballot.
The Zanu PF leader then claimed the second round but by means most foul according to the opposition only to be forced into a power-sharing arrangement by regional leaders.
On Tuesday Mugabe again condemned the strictures after his meeting with Lavrov whose country has also been targeted with sanctions by western countries over its alleged involvement in strife-torn neighbouring Ukraine.
Said Mugabe: “Take back to President Putin that we feel with him that those imposing sanctions on him have done so on us …
“That these are the evil men of our world those who go and act in defiance of international law, sanctions never approved by the UN and those falling on the Russian Federation today have not been approved by the UN and those which yesterday were imposed on us and remain on us were never approved by the UN.
“They are the works of evil men of our world who are defiant of international law and morality of international law. We stand together we will fall together.”
The economic support from China and Russia will come as a huge boost for Mugabe and his Zanu PF party.
Former RBZ chief, and adviser to the veteran leader, Gideon Gono, indicated ahead of last year’s elections that economic recovery would need a decisive victor in the crucial vote.
Mugabe and Zanu PF delivered a landslide triumph but the economic bounce Gono suggested would follow has not transpired. Instead, companies have been closing down by the hundreds, throwing thousands onto the already huge jobless pile.
And the opposition has been quick to remind Zimbabweans that Mugabe promised them two million new jobs while campaigning last year. They also point out that the Zanu PF government’s ZimAsset economic blueprint remains stalled because no one will provide the US$27 billion needed to finance it.
But Mugabe expects the situation to improve with friendly countries such as China and Russia playing a key role.
Speaking after his return from China, Mugabe said he had secured funding for massive projects that would help create thousands of jobs.
“These projects will be coming … (they) can employ our young people from school boys and girls. You will be seeing them; but of course things don’t just become shining overnight,” he said.
The veteran leader also claimed that Western countries were following the deals between China and Harare with keen interest and looking to re-engage with Harare.
“I can assure you that Britain, Europe and America are already starting to get worried that they have been replaced by China.” he said.

ZIMBABWE is courting China Power Investment Corporation (CPIC) to invest in the $2,2 billion Sengwa Thermal Power Station in Gokwe, Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa has said. “We have held meetings with CPI who are in the power industry. “We want to interest them to take up investment of Sengwa Thermal Power Station in Gokwe. This is an exploratory meeting with them.“We made a presentation which they will study and consider whether to invest in the thermal power station phase 1 which will produce 1,200MW,” said Minister              Chinamasa.The Minister spoke after meeting officials from CPIC who expressed willingness to invest in the thermal power station.
“We are willing to work together with the government of Zimbabwe and the companies to make our contribution to the power development in this country. Zimbabwe and China are very friendly countries.“Through efforts from both sides we hope we can bring economic co-operation between the two countries going forward,” said CPIC president Mr Lu Qizhou.CPIC, which has power projects in Tanzania, Kenya and Mozambique, is conducting investigations on the thermal project and other small hydro electricity projects.“We are here to do some investigation in the power market in Zimbabwe. We are doing a research on a small hydro project in Zimbabwe.
“We will get some more information on the thermal power project,” said Lu.Minister Chinamasa said it is important for the country to be attractive to investors in order to harness international capital.
The Sengwa Thermal Power Station is owned by RioZim and Rio Tinto PLC and Minister Chinamasa said there will be “a lot of negotiations with the companies for a framework that makes this happen.”“The two companies are however in the loop, it’s now just an issue of looking for resources to get it done,” he said.

Farirai Machivenyika Senior Reporter
President Mnangagwa has invited Chinese construction firm, Shanghai Construction Group, to establish offices in Zimbabwe in preparation for future infrastructure construction projects, as the country moves to fulfil Vision 2030 aimed at achieving an upper middle-income society.
The President was speaking after touring the new Parliament Building under construction in Mt Hampden yesterday, which he said was symbolic of the strategic relationship between Zimbabwe and China.
The 650-seater building is being constructed by Shanghai Construction Group using a grant of approximately US$98 million (RMB676,43 million) extended to Zimbabwe by the Chinese government.
Zimbabwe is targeting development and modernisation of roads, railways, airports and other related infrastructure to fulfil provisions of the Transitional Stabilisation Programme (TSP) and enhance the lives of ordinary people.
“This company (Shanghai Construction Group) which is building this Parliament for us has been on the continent for many years, possibly decades and has repute across the continent for constructing buildings or infrastructure of repute,” said the President.
“Now they are in Zimbabwe and they are building this one for us freely. We are grateful, but I would wish that they continue to remain in Zimbabwe. In the area of infrastructure development, Zimbabwe is still lagging behind and I am informed that this company has multiple skills in the area of construction of infrastructure.
“Even by the time we complete this project, there are other projects currently being discussed and seeking financing and I have no doubt that we will be able to select you to implement such projects in Zimbabwe.”
President Mnangagwa said the construction of the Parliament building was as a result of a discussions he held with his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, during the FOCAC summit in Beijing last year.
“There are issues which were discussed under the FOCAC (Forum on China-Africa Cooperation) meeting in September last year and currently there are discussions which should be undertaken this month at ministerial level,” said President Mnangagwa.
“Under that programme, China-Africa programme, there is a $60 billion facility from China to Africa and I have no doubt that Zimbabwe will share part of that cake for infrastructure development.”
President Mnangagwa said under the new dispensation, business takes precedence over politics, citing that investors must shun corruption and focus on doing business using the correct channels.
“Now, business takes front seat and politics takes a back seat,” he said. “The cost of short-cuts and the disregard of local authority by-laws and architectural requirements have far reaching and dire implications to one’s investments
“Individuals and corporate property investors must, therefore, make sound and corrupt-free decisions.”
President Mnangagwa praised Shanghai Construction Group for the work it is doing at the New Parliament Building site, whose ground breaking ceremony was done in November last year.
“This edifice will be one of the most unique parliaments in our region,” he said. “Besides being unique, it’s demonstrative of our comprehensive, strategic relationship with the People’s Republic of China. There are many friends we have, but this is one symbolic stature which generations to come will know it is a demonstration of the cooperation between the people of Zimbabwe and the people of China.”
President Mnangagwa commended the construction firm for moving with speed, saying the project was likely to be completed before the scheduled three years.
“I am told that the period of construction is expected to span a period of three years, but I would speculate that with the pace the project is being implemented, there is a possibility that the construction of this parliament will be finished earlier than projected,” he said.
“The Chinese working culture is a culture I believe we should emulate. The Chinese are very hard-working and get focused on the project they would be doing. I have no doubt that our own Zimbabwean people; the craftsmen who are here, the engineers who are here, the architects that are here will benefit not only in terms of skills, but in terms of technology that has been brought here.”
President Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe and China shared a historic relationship and thanked China and Russia for vetoing attempts by Western nations in 2008 to invoke Chapter 7 of the UN Charter and impose sanctions on Zimbabwe.
“The relationship between China and Zimbabwe is special,” he said. “We have a very strong history of trade between us. We also have a recent history of liberation where China stood by the oppressed people of this country and supported us through our armed struggle to liberate ourselves.
“They vetoed that evil scheme which was intended by our detractors to punish us. So, you can see that China is a solid friend of Zimbabwe.
President Mnangagwa said he was satisfied with the improving trade between Zimbabwe and China.
“I am happy because then it speaks of the diversification of our economy unlike in the past our economy was substantively based on the Western structure where whatever we needed we had to go to the West,” he said.
“But now it is necessary that we do not put our eggs in one basket, we should spread them.”
In his remarks, Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe, Mr Guo Shaochun said: “The construction of the Parliament building enhances the working conditions of the Zimbabwe parliament as it comes when the Parliament is discussing important issues towards achieving Vision 2030.

Zimbabwe,7868,herald.co.zw,2017-05-04T00:00:20Z,Chinese firm to set up assembly plant in Zim,"Business Reporter
One of the world’s leading automotive manufacturing companies, FAW Group Corporation is in the initial stages of setting up a vehicle assembly plant in Zimbabwe this year.
This planned development is expected to boost Government’s efforts to revive the country’s motor assembly industry.As part of its commitment to investing in the county, FAW Zimbabwe recently opened a showroom and offices in Bulawayo in addition to the one it has been operating in Harare over the last five years.
FAW Zimbabwe top executive Patrick Masocha told The Herald Business yesterday that the Chinese headquartered company, which also has operations in South Africa is in the process of securing land for the plant construction.
“We want to set up an assembly plant in Zimbabwe before the end of the third quarter of this year. The company is looking at investing a substantial amount of money in infrastructural development and purchasing of machinery. We are also looking forward to employing between 150 and 200 people,” he said.
Mr Masocha said although business was at its lowest due to the prevailing liquidity crunch and the general decline in the country’s economic performance, FAW Zimbabwe is confident of grabbing a large chunk of the market.
“As a company we are optimistic that the country’s economic fortunes will change for the better thus the reason we intend to invest through setting up an assembling plant. We opened shop in Bulawayo at the backdrop of many companies either closing shop or relocating to Harare, it shows the confidence we have on the local market.
“Our parent company manufacturing plant is headquartered in Changchun and not in Beijing and the one in South Africa is in Port Elizabeth instead of Pretoria and us setting up an assembly plant in Zimbabwe, we will be replicating the same trend whereby we don’t necessarily have to base in capital cities,” said Mr Masocha.
He said the setting up of the vehicle assembly plant by the company would have a positive impact on Zimbabwe’s downstream industries.
“We expect the opening of our assembly plant to stimulate other industries mostly downstream industries such as rubber and glass manufacturers as well as leather products manufacturers.
“There are a lot of leather companies in Bulawayo and hopefully we will be able to give business to all these industries including the National Railways of Zimbabwe because we expect it to haul most of our bulk material,” said Mr Masocha.
FAW Group Corporation is a Chinese state-owned automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Changchun, Jilin, China. Its principal products are automobiles; buses; light, medium, and heavy-duty trucks; and auto parts.
FAW became China’s first automobile manufacturer when it unveiled the nation’s first domestically produced passenger car, the Hong Qi, in 1953.
FAW is one of the “Big Four” Chinese automakers alongside Changan Automobile, Dongfeng Motor, and SAIC Motor.
In 2014, the company ranked third in terms of output making 2,7 billion whole vehicles and in 2015 the company made total sales of 18 million vehicles worldwide.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Bulawayo', 'Harare'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa', 'Port Elizabeth', 'Pretoria'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Changchun', 'Beijing', 'Jilin', 'Hongqi']}",investment,"['FAW Group', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Chinese', 'FAW Group']","['Chinese', 'FAW Group', 'Beijing']","['Chinese', 'FAW Group', 'Beijing']"
Zimbabwe,4589,zimbabwesituation.com,2015-08-14T10:18:47Z,SPB tackles solar tender irregularities,"The State Procurement Board has directed short-listed bidders to submit a price breakdown of the estimated $570 million Zimbabwe Power Company solar tender, to deal with irregularities that have delayed the project.
The price breakdowns will form part of the final evaluation criterion, the basis on which the winners for power generation capacity ramp initiatives will be chosen.
This follows irregularities that characterised initial tender submissions where bidders included cost prices in instances where only technical details of the tender were required.
A source privy to details said the bidders have now been given new forms to fill in the break downs of prices for every technical aspect of the tender prior to final evaluation.
The short-listed bidders for the $570 million solar projects are ZTE Corporation, Number 17 Metallurgical China, Intratrek Zimbabwe and China Jiangxi for International Corporation.
The solar projects, with combined output capacity of 300 megawatts, will be situated in Bulawayo, Gwanda and Munyati, all of which are strategic locations due to the abundant sunshine.
While four made it to the list of the final contenders, official documents show that ZPC had recommended China Jiangxi, Intratrek and Number 17 Metallurgical China. In its technical evaluation report the procurer, Zimbabwe Power Corporation, had stated that bidders should include a bill of quantities, but excluding the price details of the project.
Some of the companies should have been disqualified after allegedly including prices on aspects of the technical specifications of the tender in violation of laid out rules against this.
But the affected companies argued that they had not received documents clearly spelling out that they were not supposed to include price quotations in technical submissions.
ZTE Corporation included in its request for proposal forms of tender with prices for Lot 1 (Insukamini), Lot 3 (Munyati) while China Jiangxi included prices for Lot 1 and 3 as well.
Afriven Investments, another of the original six bidders included prices for Lot 2 (Gwanda) in its funding envelope.
The industry source said the SPB had inexplicably railroaded one of them to the short listing of the successful bids, which would each have been automatic winners for the three projects.
“The bidders have been given forms and told to provide separate price breakdown for each specification (transmission network, solar plant and delivery duty,” the source said.
The score card performance from cost price quotations will be evaluated together with the score obtained in terms of technical details of the tender bids already submitted.
However, the source said, all the bidding companies will be expected to provide clearing price break downs of the original proposals for each technical aspect of the tender. The three projects are expected to help meet Government targets for power generation, including tapping into renewable sources of energy, as espoused in the Zim-Asset.
Zimbabwe is currently able to generate an average of 1 200MW, against peak period demand for power of 2 200MW, a position which is negatively affecting economic recovery.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Bulawayo'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",investment,['ZTE Corporation'],['ZTE'],['Jiangxi'],['Jiangxi']

Chief Reporter
China’s signature foreign trade policy, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is set to accelerate President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s drive to establish an upper middle-income economy within the next 11 years, a Cabinet Minister has said.
In her remarks in Beijing at a high-level BRI meeting attended by several ministers from around the world, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said BRI had come at the most opportune time as it feeds into the country’s Vision 2030. A brainchild of China’s President Xi Jinping, BRI aims to re-create the ancient Silk Road trade routes with the rest of the world and open up trade opportunities worth trillions of dollars.
“My President (Emmerson Mnangagwa) has the grand national vision to transform Zimbabwe into a modern middle-income country by 2030. To achieve this noble goal, he is championing the mantra ‘Zimbabwe Is Open for Business’. He is keenly determined that Zimbabwe attracts the foreign direct investment that is key to fulfil his national vision. He has duly instructed his people to learn from global best practice and to proceed to excel in offering the most hospitable climate to enterprising global capital.”
BRI, she added, essentially shows China’s ambition to share economic growth with developing countries.
Minister Mutsvangwa – who spent several years in Beijing when her husband, Ambassador Christopher Mutsvangwa, was Zimbabwe’s top envoy to China – described the world’s second-biggest economy’s meteoric rise to prosperity as “the most frenetic pace of economic changes ever in the history of humankind”.
She said Zimbabwe seeks to be “a good partner” to China under the BRI.
“My nation of Zimbabwe knows this Chinese attribute of China as a well-meaning friend. Indeed ours is a case study and my presence here speaks volumes of our eagerness to learn and share without imagined fear or prejudice.”
In his speech at the summit’s closing yesterday, President Xi said deals worth more than US$64 billion had been signed last week alone, with more deals expected to be penned in the coming years.
In a separate interview with The Sunday Mail, China’s Ambassador to Zimbabwe Guo Shaochun said Harare is poised for massive spin-offs from BRI.
“The second BRI summit in Beijing has been very successful. It intends to connect China to the world through five pillars, which are policy coordination, trade connectivity, financial connectivity, infrastructure connectivity and people-to-people connectivity.
“Zimbabwe and China are close friends and recently our relations were elevated from all-weather friends to comprehensive strategic partnership.
“The BRI provides the framework to raise our relations to an even higher level. We want to challenge the Zimbabwean Government, through their technocrats, to work out the strategies with us, on how we can elevate the relations,” he said.
Beijing, he added, will continue to push Chinese enterprises to invest in the country in order to promote economic development.
The envoy believes the ease of doing business reforms has the potential to attract more investments.

Zimbabwe,5347,newsday.co.zw,2015-12-01T00:00:00Z,"China's Xi in Zimbabwe to sign power, infrastructure deals","Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Zimbabwe on Tuesday, the first visit by a Chinese leader since 1996, amid expectations that he would sign deals to fund infrastructure, electricity generation and other projects.
Reuters
Zimbabwe, which became a pariah in the West after President Robert Mugabe’s government was accused of rigging votes and human rights abuses, has increasingly turned to China for investment to help an economy desperate for new infrastructure like roads, power and water.
Zimbabwe and China’s Import and Export Bank is expected to loan Harare more than $1 billion to fund the 600 megawatt (MW) expansion of Hwange coal power station, officials said.
Xi plans to travel to South Africa on Wednesday, where he will meet President Jacob Zuma and later co-chair the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summit in Johannesburg.
Zimbabwean Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa said four agreements on electricity generation, including the expansion of Hwange would be signed, as well as deals on road construction and infrastructure development during Xi’s two-day visit.
China’s Sinohydro Corp won the $1.5 billion bid to add two generation plants at Hwange in western Zimbabwe in October last year, in the most ambitious move yet to tackle the country’s crippling electricity shortages.
“Financial closure has been reached and the agreement for Hwange 7 and 8 will be signed today,” Chinamasa told Reuters during a ceremony to welcome Xi at an airport in Harare.
Noah Gwariro, managing director of state-owned Zimbabwe Power Company, which owns Hwange, said engineering, procurement and construction of Hwange would cost $1.175 billion while interest, bank charges and Zimbabwe’s down payment for the project would cost $325 million.
China is Africa’s largest trading partner and the trade volume between them amounted to $220 billion in 2014, according to China state news agency Xinhua. Its investments in Africa amounted to $32.4 billion at the end of 2014, according to London-based BMI Research.
Africans broadly see China as a healthy counterbalance to Western influence though Western governments charge China of turning a blind eye to conflicts and rights abuses as they pursue trade and aid policies there.
Zimbabwe’s economy is struggling to emerge from a recession between 1999-2008, which saw gross domestic product shrink by 45 percent. On Aug. 25 Mugabe said his country’s economy was poised for a major take-off with China’s help.

Zimbabwe,7662,newzimbabwevision.com,2017-03-29T02:17:25Z,"Motor Industries (WMI), after five years, officially resumed operations on Monday following a joint venture with a Chinese firm","Motor Industries (WMI), which has been shut for the last five years, officially resumed operations on Monday following a joint venture with a Chinese firm for assembling locally of a new range of pick-ups from semi knocked down kits.
The deal will see WMI assembling 3 000 units in three years, which will create 5 000 jobs and generate millions in taxes, with $1,3 million in Value Added Tax expected to be generated this year alone.
The partnership has resulted in the formation of Beiqi Zimbabwe, a joint venture between China’s fifth largest car manufacturer, the Beijing Automobile International Corporation (BAIC), WMI and Astol Motors.
The pick-ups that will be put together at WMI are called BAIC Great Tiger.
Beiqi Zimbabwe is responsible for procuring the semi knocked down kits from BAIC in China, while WMI will assemble the vehicles on a contract basis and Astol Motors, together with Amtec, will sell the vehicles and offer after service support.
WMI’s assembly plant had been under care and maintenance for the last five years and has now assumed the new role of a multi-contract assembler.
From the deal with BAIC, total sales volume is expected to be about 490 units this year, before rising to 940 units in 2018.
Of the 3 000 units, which will comprise pick-ups, sedans and SUVs (to be launched later this year) 500 units will be exported to other Sadc countries.
Industry and Commerce Minister Mike Bimha, who officially launched the deal, said it was a clear indication of the excellent and cordial relations between Zimbabwe and China, and the kind of investment that the country was seeking.
“The investment has come at the most opportune time given that Willowvale Motor Industries had suspended production since September 2012,” he said.
“Today, the factory has been refurbished to some extent, but we hope our Chinese partners will transform it further into a state-of-the-art facility given the great strides they have made in technology advancement.
“I wish to applaud BAIC International Group for the milestone it has achieved so far which is evidenced by the semi-knocked down (sKD) kits that have been brought into the country to kick-start production.
“We would like to see a situation where BEIQI Zimbabwe moves from sKD production to completely-knocked down (cKD) production and possibly venture into local manufacturing of vehicle components.
“It is these kinds of partnerships that obtain across jurisdictions that Zimbabwe as a country is looking for. This enables the country not only to substitute imports, but generate the much needed foreign currency through exports and create employment.”
Minister Bimha called on banks to support the initiative by establishing retail financing structures at favourable terms, so as to stimulate demand and ensure growth of the sector.
He said Government was finalising the Motor Industry Development Policy Framework expected to increase capacity utilisation of car assemblers from levels of below 10 percent to the year 2000 levels of around 70 percent.
BAIC’s vice president Mr Wei Huacheng said they were committed to assisting in the growth of the local economy through their assistance to the motor industry.
“Beiqi considers Zimbabwe and Sadc as a whole market, we are going to start to export assembled vehicles in Zimbabwe to Sadc countries from 2018,” he said.
“The main market share in Zimbabwe is pick-ups at 68 percent, cars 12 percent and SUVs 15 percent.
“We will focus on the pick-up market with our diesel engine double cab and single cab, 4×2 and 4×4.”
Mr Huacheng said 60 sets knocked down kits and $15 000 worth of spare parts were already ware housed in the country, while jigs, tools and facilities were ready and workers have been trained.
Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Huang Ping said the partnership will further deepen the co-operation between Zimbabwe and China, which has so far fostered a number of projects.
“I believe that the cooperation with BAIC Group will inject new strength into Willowvale Motor Industries plant and bring it into new successes,” he said.
“Besides, the project is all the more remarkable given the sluggish economic situation at present since it shows that Chinese companies have cast a vote of confidence in the development prospects of Zimbabwe.
“I believe the Beiqi Zimbabwe project will cement China-Zimbabwe cooperation in the automotive industry and drive its development and the economy by bringing products, capital, technology, standards, services and management concept, as well as increasing Government tax revenue and employment opportunities,” he said.

In case of nationalization for the public interests, the process should be done legally and investors should be compensated.The ambassador referred to the recent shutdown of business operations in Marange diamond fields where two of the Chinese-Zimbabwean joint ventures were operating.The two, along with four other joint ventures involving investors from South Africa, United Arab Emirates, Russia, and etc, had been ordered by Mines and Mining Development Minister Walter Chidhakwa to join a consolidated diamond mining firm or pack and leave in three months’ time.Huang said he had raised the issue with several Zimbabwean ministers and the two sides agreed to protect the personal and property rights of the Chinese investors, respect the rule of law, and enhance communication to avoid such business frictions derailing the overall friendly cooperation of the two countries.“We understand that the move was not targeted at Chinese businesses, but unfortunately two of our joint ventures were affected,” he said.“Both Chinese and Zimbabwean sides don’t want to see the friendship be affected by this case.”Huang said the government supported the affected businesses to solve the issue via judiciary means, and would keep following the case to urge the protection of the lawful rights of Chinese investors in Zimbabwe.China and Zimbabwe have enjoyed a cordial tie since Zimbabwe’s liberation struggle.

Zimbabwe,11839,herald.co.zw,2020-08-17T00:00:00Z,"Aussie, Chinese investors keen to fire up Zisco","Martin Kadzere Senior Reporter
There is a renewed interest in the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (Zisco) from international investors following the collapse of negotiations between the company and R & F of China late last year.
Industry and Commerce Minister Dr Sekai Nzenza, told The Herald Finance & Business in an interview yesterday that Zisco had received enquiries from potential investors from China and Australia.
“What is exciting is the level of interest we are receiving and the revival of Zisco is critical to the National Steel Strategy that the Government is working on,” said Dr Nzenza.
Zisco stopped operations in 2008 due to lack of capital to recapitalise and poor management. With its furnaces having capacity to produce up to one million tonnes annually, the company was among Zimbabwe’s major foreign currency earners.
Dr Nzenza said various parties would be involved in the selection of the investor including the a committee of ministers and the Zimbabwe Investment Development Agency to ensure proper due diligence.
The Government is working on the National Steel Strategy meant to create a vibrant industry.
Zisco started operations in Bulawayo in 1938 having been formed by a private consortium.
In 1942, the Government formed the Rhodesia Iron and Steel Commission, a statutory body which took over the steel works.
In 1946, a small plant was constructed at Redcliff and commenced production in 1948. Between 1948 and 1956, Zisco gradually expanded and a year later, the Rhodesia Iron and Steel Company was formed followed by an expansion programme, which saw the commissioning of modern blast furnaces and installation of the first coke oven battery.
The expansion of the plant continued until 1975 when blast furnace 4 was commissioned, bringing steel works capacity to one million tonnes of liquid steel per year.
By early 1990’s operations at Zisco started deteriorating while mining costs at Buchwa Mine sharply rose, forcing the company to develop Ripple Creek Mine for the supply of iron ore to the blast furnaces.
Blast Furnace 4 was reaching the end of its lifespan and was taken off in 1994. A Chinese company was contracted to reconstruct and reline the furnace, which was recommissioned in 1999.
Zisco is 91 percent owned by the Government.
The remaining 9 percent is held by Louth Minerals SA (3 percent), Tonexin Investments (2,8 percent), Stewarts and Lloyds (Overseas) (1,76 percent), Franconian Investments (0,81 percent), Amzim Limited (0,75 percent) and Zambia Copper Investment Limited (0,13 percent).
The Government in 2013 entered into an agreement with ESSAR of India to sell 60 percent shareholding but the deal collapsed in 2015.
The Government then signed another agreement with R & F Properties of China to sell its entire shareholding but again the deal collapsed in December last year.
At the time Zisco was in talks with R & F, the Government agreed to sell some of Zisco key assets to ZimCoke, a company fronted by Mr Eddie Cross.
The agreement is being reviewed after the board raised concerns.
Zisco, when operational will have potential to be one of the largest foreign currency earners for the country’s.
It will be an engine for growth in the agriculture, mining, building, construction and manufacturing industries.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Bulawayo', 'Buhwa School'], 'ZMB': ['Republic of Zambia'], 'AUS': ['Ripple Creek']}",investment,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,74,newsday.co.zw,2012-02-10T00:00:00Z,Chinese hotel project haunts EMA,"The Environmental Management Agency (EMA) says the construction of a hotel on a wetland near the National Sports Stadium by a Chinese company can only be stopped by a ministerial order.
Anjin, which is also involved in diamond mining in Chiadzwa, was once ordered to stop construction of the hotel by EMA because the project threatened the fragile environment.
Aaron Chigona, the EMA director, told journalists after giving oral evidence to Parliaments Thematic Committee on Natural Resources, Environment and Tourism on Wednesday that construction on wetlands had become a major challenge.
It is difficult for EMA to say those people should stop building because it is only a ministerial order that can effect the stoppage, said Chigona, referring to the Anjin project.
The minister (Environment and Natural Resources Management, Francis Nhema) in terms of the Environment Act is the only one who has power to authorise building on wetlands and we expect the minister to make a decision on whether to issue that order in two weeks time or not.
Chigona told the committee made up of senators that a legal framework must be put in place to regulate construction work on wetlands.
The firm in question is trying to reduce the size of the wetland and if there was a proper legal framework, these developers would have been made to ensure there was improvement on the wetland, he said.
He said EMA was also struggling to ensure developers carried out environment impact assessment studies before embarking on major projects.
We have been battling to ensure that this process is implemented by developers, but it is unfortunate our developers are not taking this as a planning tool, Chigona said.
EMA environment, education and publicity officer for Mashonaland West, Astas Mabwe, said Chitungwiza Town Council was also guilty of carrying out construction projects on wetlands.

Zimbabwe,8066,zimbabwesituation.com,2017-06-23T06:48:00Z,Zimbabwe's ‘Disneyland’ at Victoria Falls Gets Beijing Investment,"Source: China in Africa: Zimbabwe’s ‘Disneyland’ at Victoria Falls Gets Beijing Investment – Newsweek 22/6/2017
Zimbabwe just got one step closer to its dream of building a “Disneyland in Africa,” at the site of Victoria Falls, one of the world’s biggest waterfalls. Zimbabwe’s Tourism Minister Walter Mzembi tells Newsweek that the country has signed a “memorandum of understanding” with Chinese investors to carry out a feasibility study and draw up a masterplan for the project, first proposed in 2013 as a $300 million-park with hotels, entertainment parks and restaurants.
Mzembi says that the project will contribute to building a $5 billion tourism industry in Zimbabwe by 2020. That would mean a five-fold increase on 2016’s figures, when the government stated 2016 that tourism was worth $1 billion.
The United States, European Union and others imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe following the implementation of its controversial land reform program in 2000—which included the forcible seizure of white-owned farms—and Mzembi says that had a devastating effect on tourism.
However, the minister believes that Zimbabwe’s standing in the international community has now improved, and that the Victoria Falls project can help to revamp its image. “Tourism is a peace sector and tourism is a peace bridge. It has worked for us very well,” Mzembi tells Newsweek. “We are not the bad boy of the world in Zimbabwe any more, not at all.”
China is Africa’s single largest trade partner and has invested hugely in infrastructure projects on the continent, such as a $4 billion railway linking major cities in Kenya.
Relations between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Zimbabwe’s leader Robert Mugabe are close. During a 2015 visit to Zimbabwe, Xi signed multiple economic deals, including one for more than $1 billion of Chinese investment in Zimbabwe’s largest thermal power plant. That year China also canceled $40 million of debt owed by Zimbabwe; in response, Zimbabwe made the Chinese currency, the yuan, legal tender in the country.
Mzembi declines to identify the Chinese investors, but indicates that they would be from a state-run company. He also says that while the Chinese are carrying out the initial preparations, he has received “so many proposals running into billions and billions of dollars from potential investors,” including in the U.S., South Korea and the U.K. “We are not closing anybody out,” says Mzembi, while admitting that the Chinese have a “head start.”
The minister says that the project will focus around a modern conference center, with hotels hotels, villas and a museum also at the site. Victoria Falls is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so Mzembi says that construction will take place at a safe distance so as not to interfere with the natural features of the waterfall.
“It’s time to mobilize that destination and make it compete with other waterfall projects like Niagara, Iguazu and elsewhere,” says Mzembi. Niagara Falls is located on the U.S.-Canada border, while Iguazu Falls is on the border between Argentina and Brazil.
The project marks an attempt to rebrand the international image of Zimbabwe, which has been largely associated with economic malaise and authoritarian rule under President Mugabe, who has been in power since the country’s independence in 1980. Mugabe, 93, is standing in Zimbabwe’s next general election in 2018, despite widespread protests in recent months.
Zimbabwe’s economy is currently in a slump: Unemployment is high, and a crippling shortage of U.S. dollars prompted the reserve bank to start printing its own pseudo-currency—known as bond notes—in 2016. The country has not had its own currency since the Zimbabwean dollar became defunct in 2009 following a period of massive hyperinflation that meant the price of a loaf of bread rose to billions of dollars. The introduction of bond notes has raised fears that the country may be sliding towards another period of inflation.
Foreign tourist arrivals to Zimbabwe increased to 2.06 million in 2015, up from 1.88 million in 2014, according to the latest report from the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority. More than four out of five arrivals in Zimbabwe came from elsewhere in Africa, but the southern African country also has big tourism markets in the United States and United Kingdom.
Zimbabwe opened a new international airport at Victoria Falls in December 2016, which it expects to handle 1.5 million passengers per year. The tourism ministry wants the area to become a “regional hub” for foreign visitors to southern Africa: Victoria Falls itself lies on the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia, and is also close to Botswana, which is popular with foreign tourists undertaking safaris.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Victoria Falls'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Niagara', 'Niagara Falls'], 'KOR': ['Republic of Korea'], 'ARG': ['Argentine Republic', 'Cataratas del Iguazú'], 'ZMB': ['Republic of Zambia'], 'BWA': ['Republic of Botswana']}",investment,"['Xi Jinping', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

Yunnan Linkun Investment Group of China has acquired a 50 percent shareholding in China-Africa Sunlight Energy and plans to invest an initial $700 million towards the development of Gwayi Coal-Electricity Integrated Project in Matabeleland North Province. This follows the termination of a joint venture between the initial partners Shandong Taishan Sunlight Investment Company Limited and Old Stone Investments, the local shareholders. The JV was terminated after Shandong failed to mobilise the required funding for the project.
The project, which was granted National Project Status by Government will see the group set up coal mining operations and construct a 2X300 Megawatts thermal power station. “We have secured a new investor to take up a 50 percent stake in CASECO from the previous shareholder; Shandong Taishan Sunlight. Efforts are being made to reimburse the company (Shandong) its initial investment of about $12 million.
“In fact, the new investor is willing to reimburse provided the amount is verified as well,” China Africa Sunlight chief executive Mr Charles Mugari told The Herald Business in an interview on Tuesday.
Mr Mugari said the new investor has capacity to move the Gwayi project forward. An immediate capital injection for running the company will be made available while the company is also engaged in negotiations with a Chinese Bank to secure a loan by the end of this month.
“We have concluded the indicative term sheet. Conclusion of the final loan agreement will be done by the end of this month so that an initial capital injection of $700 million into the project will be done by the beginning of next year,” said Mr Mugari.
He said the termination of the previous joint venture was mutual and there was no bad blood between the two parties. Mr Mugari said since the coming on board of the new investor, CASECO has identified a new EPC contractor, Sinohydro Bureau 3 Corporation Limited and the Bank of China is also expected to fund the project.
“Sinohydro engineers were in Zimbabwe last October for due diligence. A document was completed and we went to China for the signing of the EPC contract on November 18.
The signing ceremony was witnessed by Energy and Power Development Permanent Secretary Patson Mbiriri and Defence Permanent Secretary Martin Rushwaya and the Zimbabwean Ambassador to China, Paul Chikawa,” said Mr Mugari.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Shandong Sheng'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Matabeleland North Province']}",investment,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['Shandong', 'Chinese']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Shandong']"
Zimbabwe,13934,zimbabwesituation.com,2023-01-02T10:07:51Z,EU strikes deal with Chile in bid to beat China to vast lithium reserves,"“We saw the same example with Indonesia with nickel and Chile even tried to build a deeper lithium supply chain several years ago, though those circumstances were different and the country didn’t attempt to ban lithium exports, but instead levied huge royalties on lithium producers in the country,” Berry said.
Chinese firms that had made recent lithium investments in Zimbabwe would need to build processing facilities there at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars so they can export higher value lithium chemicals, he said.
“There is a great deal of capital required to build chemical conversion facilities outside of China, not to mention the two- or three-year lead time necessary to actually complete construction and commissioning,” he said.
Berry added that if more countries followed suit, it could have wider implications – such as higher prices for lithium and other raw materials such as cobalt.
Lithium prices have surged by about 1,100 per cent to a record in the past two years, with supply struggling to keep up with high demand. Lithium carbonate spot prices in China – the world’s biggest electric-vehicle market – climbed to a record US$84,000 per tonne in November, according to Benchmark Minerals’ lithium price index.
In the past year, three Chinese companies – Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, Sinomine Resource Group and Chengxin Lithium Group – have acquired lithium projects in Zimbabwe worth a combined US$679 million, amid the worldwide race to go green.
Huayou Cobalt and Chengxin Lithium are already developing processing plants that would mean they are exempt from the export ban.
Huayou Cobalt acquired the Arcadia hard-rock lithium mine outside Harare for US$422 million from Australian company Prospect Resources last year. The battery maker told the South China Morning Post in September that it was investing US$300 million to develop the mine with an aim to expand production for the electric-vehicle market.
When Huayou Cobalt bought Prospect’s stake in the mine, one of the conditions from the Zimbabwean government was that the firm would process the mineral locally to make lithium-ion batteries.
The company said it would process first-line lithium concentrates of spodumene and petalite in the first phase.
“We are not going to export raw ore,” Huayou Cobalt said. “Lithium is one of many inputs needed for the production of batteries – and we do not enjoy access to all others at the same time. In phase two of our work here, we are targeting production of lithium sulphates, and that is as far as we can see feasible under local conditions.”
Meanwhile, Chengxin Lithium spent US$77 million on a deal last year that includes mining rights in the largely unexplored Sabi Star lithium and tantalum mine project in eastern Zimbabwe. A groundbreaking ceremony was held there earlier this month for a US$130 million lithium processing plant.

Lauren Johnston, a China-Africa researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs, said that “if African and Chinese interests diverge on minerals, and since Europe wants them [minerals] too, it might be most efficient to do the process at source and then share the fruits across those markets”.
She said this was especially the case if the manufacturing could be done from renewable energy sources in the first instance, like hydrogen.
But she said “if more African countries ban the export of key renewable minerals but are not ready yet to do the processing at home due to governance, infrastructure, energy and labour challenges, then this could impede the development of renewables globally”.
According to Gorden Moyo, director of the Public Policy and Research Institute of Zimbabwe, the export ban was long overdue.
“It makes perfect economic sense for Zimbabwe and all other countries to break the vicious circle of commodity export,” said Moyo, a former Zimbabwean minister for state enterprises.
“Raw materials fetch low prices in the global markets while at the same time exporting commodities is equivalent to exporting jobs.”
He noted that lithium was a key mineral in the clean energy transition. “If well managed, the massive lithium deposits in Zimbabwe may contribute towards public debt settlement, job creation and increased economic activity in the country,” Moyo said.
But he said the export ban would not stop smuggling.
“In reality the ban is meaningless simply because there is no political will to curb illicit mineral trade in Zimbabwe,” Moyo said, adding that it was being carried out by “military businessmen and women, senior government officials and politically exposed persons”.",1,,,"{'None': ['Europe'], 'CHL': ['Republic of Chile'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'IDN': ['Republic of Indonesia'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Manicaland Province', 'Harare', 'Buhera District'], 'USA': ['Arcadia']}",investment,['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Zhejiang']","['Zhejiang', 'Chinese', 'China']"

THE Government has renewed talks with a Chinese Investor, R and F for the revival of Ziscosteel after the initial deal collapsed.
The now-defunct giant iron and steel manufacturer now requires about US$500 million for it to come back to life.
Speaking to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Industry and Commerce led by Cde Joshua Sacco in Kwekwe last week, Ziscosteel chief executive officer Mr Alois Gowo said Government has rekindled hope for the revival of once Southern Africa’s giant steel producer after reengaging R and F. Mr Gowo said R and F officials said there were certain requirements that had to be met first for the deal to materialise and Government was working on the outstanding issues.
“We were informed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that Government has re-opened negotiations with R and F for the revival of Ziscosteel. We were informed that there are requirements that are supposed to be met first.
We are yet to get full details of what the requirements are,” he said.
Mr Gowo said Ziscosteel requires about US$500 million for it to resume operations and was pinning hope on the ongoing negotiations with the Chinese firm.
“What I can say is that basing on our own assessment and those of other investors we need in the region of US$350 million to US$ 500 million for us to kick start operations.
We had many deals collapsing including that of R and F and Essar.
Our parent Ministry is again engaging R and F and Government will make announcements,” he said.
The committee also visited Lancashire Steel a Ziscosteel subsidiary where they were appraised on how the steel manufacturing company seeks to resume operations following a US$2 million loan facility extended to it.

The programme is part of a twinning arrangement between Zhezhiang Province and the provinces of Mashonaland West and Matabeleland North, with Chinese investors expected to take advantage of available opportunities in various economic sectors.
The agreements signed during a business forum held in Harare on Tuesday evening would also see Victoria Falls twinning with Jinhua City in the same Chinese province.
The Chinese business delegation led by Ms Ge Huin, chair of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a political legislative advisory body, yesterday visited Chinhoyi, where they met with Chinhoyi Mayor Dyke Makumbi and councillors from the municipality and Makonde Rural District Council.
The visiting delegation also visited the Korekore Cultural Village and the Chinhoyi Caves and Lions Enclosure.
Speaking after the tour, Ms Ge called for strengthening of communication and cooperation between the two provinces, while enhancing economic development between Zimbabwe and China.
“Visiting the cultural village gave us a deep impression of the traditional culture and the warm heartedness of the local people in Chinhoyi. The Chinhoyi Caves are very natural, although I have seen many such areas across the world, but these caves are very impressive as they are not only natural, but very big and you cannot see the depth. We don’t even know where the water comes from,” she said.
“We have met a lot of people in Chinhoyi and the cultural village and we hope the twinning arrangement with the municipality would lead to more communication and cooperation in different fields to strengthen our friendship.”

“We should take this twinning arrangement to open more business opportunities between our countries in areas such as the economy, education, agriculture and culture,” she said.
Mayor Makumbi paid tribute to President Mnangagwa for allowing the twinning arrangement between his town and the City of Dongyang.

President Mugabe is in China for a week-long state visit that is expected to unlock investment in infrastructure.The President is accompanied by First Lady Amai Grace Mugabe, their son Bellarmine, Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development Minister Dr Joseph Made, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Engineer Walter Mzembi; Information, Media and Broadcasting Services secretary, Cde George Charamba and other senior government officials.The delegation was received at the Beijing International Capital Airport by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Zimbabwe’s ambassador to China, Fredrick Shava, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Lin Lin and other senior Zimbabwean and Chinese government officials.Also at the airport to receive the President and his delegation were ministers who had been part of the advance team among them Cdes Mumbengegwi, Patrick Chinamasa (Finance and Economic Development), Obert Mpofu (Transport and Infrastructural Development) as well as Walter Chidhakwa (Mines and Mining Development).The ministers are part of the Zimbabwe-China Joint Permanent Commission.
President Mugabe inspected a guard of honour mounted for him by the Chinese Army on his arrival at the airport before going into a closed-door meeting with Zimbabwean and Chinese officials.Cde Charamba on Saturday said the thrust of the delegation’s visit was to deepen cooperation between Harare and Beijing contrary to claims by some sections of the private media that the delegation was in China to look for money.“We are largely looking at investment of an infrastructural nature and the focus is on energy, that is coal and thermal, hard communication by way of road networks, rail, locomotives,” Cde Charamba said.“We are also looking at areas to do with agriculture to take forward our programme of mechanisation. We are looking at strengthening the telecommunications sector, possibly broadcasting.”",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare']}",diplomatic_visit,"['Xi Jinping', 'Beijing']","['Wang Yi', 'Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Wang Yi', 'Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Wang Yi', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

Innocent Ruwende and Virginia Kashiri, Harare Bureau
Chinese President Xi Jinping has invited President Emmerson Mnangagwa to visit China to discuss future developmental projects of the two countries, and there are indications that he will oblige to make it his first visit outside Africa.
This was revealed by Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Huang Ping after paying a courtesy call on Energy and Power Development Minister Ambassador Simon Khaya Moyo at his offices in Harare yesterday.
“We want to further strengthen the good relationship and expand our cooperation in the future,” he said. “President Xi also invited President Mnangagwa to visit China at a time of his convenience and President Mnangagwa responded that he will go to China as his first out-bound visit, out of Africa.
“China will be his first destination out of Africa. We are expecting this to be happening, to see our two leaders meet to map up the blueprints for the future development of our two countries.
“I can only agree more with you on the good relationship between China and Zimbabwe, and so, now since the peaceful transfer of power, China was the first country to send a special envoy representing Chinese government to congratulate his Excellency, President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, to be the leader, and the special envoy carried a letter from President Xi Jinping demonstrating that whatever happens, China takes great importance to the friendship between China and Zimbabwe.”
Ambassador Huang said right after sending the special envoy, China dispatched a delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC) to attend Zanu-PF’s Extraordinary Congress last month, which he said went very well.
This, he said, demonstrated China’s willingness to further develop its relationship with Zimbabwe.
Ambassador Huang, who said he had visited Cde Khaya Moyo to congratulate him on his new role in the new dispensation, chronicled several projects which the two countries were undertaking.
He said he expected the $1.4 billion Hwange Power Project signed between the Government and China Export-Import Bank to take off any time soon.
Ambassador Khaya Moyo said although the country was entering into a new political dispensation, this did not change Sino-Zim relations.
“If anything, it has solidified the relationship for the simple reason that the transition was so smooth, peaceful and admired by the entire world and we say to the new leadership, well done,” he said.
“We are also saying that our relationship between China and Zimbabwe are all-weather relations. We enjoy that relationship which dates back to the days of our liberation struggle and we have of course continued since the years following our attainment of independence to see these relations grow from strength to strength.”
Cde Khaya Moyo said there had been reciprocal visits by the leaders of the two countries over the years.
Ambassador Khaya Moyo said: “You will also be pleased to know that China is the biggest investor in the country. There are a number of projects across the country, which are of great benefit to the entire people of our land.
“I want to assure you that we shall continue with these excellent relations, solidifying them and making sure that whatever we engage in is for the benefit of our two peoples.”",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare']}",diplomatic_visit,"['Xi Jinping', 'China']","['Xi Jinping', 'China']","['China', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese']"

The impending visit by Chinese Foreign Affairs Minister and State Counsellor Mr Wang Yi over the weekend as part of a five country African tour, will see the two countries discussing several agreements.
China is now Africa’s largest trading partner and a major investor in the continent.
Speaking in an interview yesterday, Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Sibusiso Moyo said Mr Wang’s visit was testimony of the strong friendship between the two countries.
“This is an important visit from an important guest from the People’s Republic of China,” he said.
“This is a great friend who is coming and is in to pursue the issues which were agreed upon between President Mnangagwa and President Xi Jinping (during President Mnangagwa’s State Visit and on the sidelines of the Forum for China Africa Cooperation).”
Some of the issues the two leaders agreed on were in the fields of trade and investment, education and skills development and China’s desire to import more citrus fruit from Zimbabwe.
Projects that are already being implemented include the expansion of Hwange 7 and 8 Thermal Power Station, expansion of Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport, NetOne expansion programme and the construction of the new Parliament Building, which is being done through a grant.
Minister Moyo said the visit by Mr Wang symbolised the political relationship which exists between the two countries.
“It also significantly depicts the strategic comprehensive partnership which has been established between the two countries and it further resonates with the kind of economic investments the People’s Republic of China has been doing in this country,” he said.
Later in the day, Minister Moyo met with the Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Guo Shaochun at his Munhumutapa Offices.
Ambassador Guo said Chinese State Counsellor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will soon pay a visit to Zimbabwe as Beijing prepares to mark the 28th Anniversary of the Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).
“The State Counsellor Wang Yi will pay a visit to Zimbabwe very, very soon and this is China’s tradition that the Foreign Minister, this is his first overseas first destination every year.
“We are very happy that he is paying Zimbabwe a visit and this is an important visit just because this year is the 28th Anniversary of FOCAC and also the anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic relationships between China and Zimbabwe,” he said.
Mr Wang’s visit is a continuation of a tradition that began in 1991 where the Asian country’s Foreign Affairs Minister visits African nations on the first overseas trip of the year.
His visit to Zimbabwe is part of a five-country tour to the continent that also includes Egypt, Djibouti, Eritrea and Burundi.
Over the past two decades, China’s trade with Africa has grown 20-fold — surpassing the United States in 2009 — to US$204 billion in 2018, according to figures from China’s commerce ministry.
Beijing is also the largest bilateral lender to most African countries.

Zimbabwe,5171,zimbabwesituation.com,2015-11-30T06:13:43Z,‘Chinese President visit inconsequential’,"OPPOSTION parties yesterday scoffed at the “much-hyped” two-day State visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, describing the jaunt as “inconsequential” and unlikely to yield the anticipated boon for Zimbabwe’s frail economy.
BY OBEY MANAYITI
In separate interviews with NewsDay ahead of the Chinese leader’s arrival in Harare tomorrow, the opposition parties said the Asian country was sceptical of Zanu PF’s long unresolved succession issue and would not risk making mega investments for now.
According to government officials, the visit is expected to open up new investment channels, as well as cement the already existing ones between Zimbabwe and China.
“It’s turning out to be a token visit and after all the promises and mega deals, the Chinese President is not even going to open a chicken run. All we will have are speeches and hot air about this being historic visits without anything to mark the history,” People’s Democratic Party spokesperson Jacob Mafume said.
“It is shameful that after all these years, the only investment from China will be the gaping halls in Chiadzwa and Marange to store water after the Chinese took the diamonds.”
MDC-T spokesperson Obert Gutu also said the Chinese would not gamble with the investment money under the current unstable political situation exacerbated by Zanu PF succession wars.
“The Chinese are fully aware of the fact that Robert Mugabe is in the sunset of his political career and as such, they will never commit any serious and big money in the Zimbabwean economy until the succession issue is resolved,” he said.
Madock Chivasa, from the National Constitutional Assembly, said there was nothing big to expect from the visit.
“There cannot be anything to expect out of the visit. Chinese are known for plundering Zimbabwe’s resources with the assistance of Zanu PF and it’s for that reason that the Chinese President is here to solidify their long-term relationship of looting resources, especially minerals,” he said.
Renewal Democrats of Zimbabwe spokesperson Pishai Muchauraya said: “We will not be happy if our resources are to be parcelled out for nothing all in the name of embracing the Chinese. We have seen so much exploitation of our resources, particularly diamonds in Chiadzwa, and we hope the visit is not about finding more ways of siphoning our resources.”
Kurauone Chihwai, from MDC, also said nothing would happen until Zimbabwe has a new leader.
However, Zanu PF political commissar Savior Kasukuwere hailed the visit, dismissing the opposition as “barking dogs devoid of mental steadiness”.
“The Chinese invest a lot of money in this country and they are the biggest investor even in the whole of Africa. We will not waste our time listening to what the opposition is saying,” he retorted. “We are looking forward to the visit. These opposition are just barking dogs.”
Zanu PF spokesperson Simon Khaya Moyo weighed in, saying the State visit has nothing to do with the opposition.
“This is a State visit and it’s [opposition] not their business to comment on that. The Chinese are our all-weather friends,” Khaya Moyo said.
“We have a warm relationship with them and they helped us liberate the country and continued supporting us for economic emancipation.
“They are investing in Zimbabwe and helping us develop our economy by injecting a lot of foregin direct investment. Who doesn’t want to welcome such a friend? We are not worried about opposition parties.

President Mugabe and First Lady Amai Grace Mugabe arrived in New York in the United States yesterday morning for the 70th meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.
The Zimbabwean leader was received at JFK International Airport by the country’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Frederick Shava and embassy officials.
In the President’s delegation are Foreign Affairs Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi and his Health and Child Care counterpart Dr David Parirenyatwa.
Gleaning the draft programme indicates some very busy days ahead for the Zimbabwe delegation.
September 25 and 26 will likely be dominated by a Special Summit to Adopt the post-2015 Development Agenda, which is the successor to the UN Millennium Development Goals.
September 27 will mark the 20th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, a landmark women’s development agreement that has shaped the gender debate for the last two decades.
On September 28, the UN General Assembly debate proper opens, while there will also be a ministerial meeting of Russia and sadc’s foreign ministers on how best to strengthen ties between the two sides.
That same day will see a high-level meeting of Landlocked Developing Countries on the Vienna Programme of Action.
There will be, on September 29, meetings on the situation in South Sudan and the DRC; as well as a high-level meeting on Youth Empowerment and the UN Demographic Dividend.
In addition to this, the draft programme reserves that day for the Third Ministerial Meeting of the Co-ordination Committee of the Africa-Arab Partnership.
President Mugabe, the African Union Chair, has been one of the staunchest advocates for democratisation of the UN — particularly the Security Council — and for reform of the global financial architecture.
The AU’s common position on UN reform, as captured in the Ezulwini Consensus, demands at least two permanent seats with veto power and five non-permanent seats on the Security Council. The AU will determine which countries occupy the seats on the continent’s behalf.
China, Britain, France, Russia and the US are the permanent members of the Security Council. China and Russia have been warm to the reforms, as have emerging powers like India and Brazil who also want to sit on the UN Security Council.

Felex Share Senior Reporter
Experts from China’s economic planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission, yesterday met Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa and assured him that the Asian country was prepared to take economic risk and assist Zimbabwe in transforming her economy.
The NDRC studies and formulates policies for the Chinese Government’s economic and social development and guides the restructuring of the country’s economic system.
The agency has sent experts led by Dr Liu Jianxing, to evaluate the mega deals signed by President Mugabe when he visited the Asian country last year to enable the financing of the projects to start rolling before year end.
The actual value of the projects would be known by Friday when a Memorandum of Understanding on the financial side of the deals would be signed.
Briefing journalists after the NDRC experts met VP Mnangagwa, War Veterans, War Collaborators, Political Detainees and Restrictees Minister, Ambassador Christopher Mutsvangwa who also attended the meeting, said Zim-Asset now had the “legs” to unleash prosperity to the people of Zimbabwe.
He said this planning body created China, the world’s largest economy.
“It is a great honour and respect to Zimbabwe that this super planning body is now being given the task to help Zimbabwe build a modern economy using their own experience in China, but adapted to the Zimbabwean circumstances. They are here to look at various priority areas of the Zimbabwean economy including selection of projects, which need immediate attention.”
Ambassador Mutsvangwa said the major thrust of the engagements was for Chinese companies to bring Foreign Direct Investment to Zimbabwe.
Special economic zones, he said, would be rolled out in the country with the expertise of the NDRC.
“They are moving away from loan financing, which has characterised our relationship because it has severe limitations to equity financing,” he said.
“Chinese companies are going to take risk, based on the resources of Zimbabwe, its strategic location, political stability, wise leadership of President Mugabe and its rich human resource base. China has built is economy on the basis of the special economic zones and it is a major recipient of FDI.”
Ambassador Mutsvangwa said focus would be mainly centred on infrastructure development and logistics.
He said the NDRC was, in conjunction with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and the Central Bank of China, taking practical steps to ensure the two countries did transactions using the Chinese currency, Renminbi (RMB).
This, he said, would prevent countries inimical to Zimbabwe from scrutinising the investments.
“Every currency is a middle man and using currencies of other countries is expensive,” Ambassador Mutsvangwa said.
“The more middle men you put between yourself, the more expensive the deal becomes and you will also be exposing your trade transactions to third parties.”
The mega deals signed by President Mugabe are expected to transform Zimbabwe’s economy and create more employment.
They are intended to be drivers for the implementation of the Zim-Asset programme that was crafted to provide solutions to problems facing the economy that rose due to illegal sanctions imposed by Western countries.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe']}",diplomatic_visit,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

The Minister of Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Professor Jonathan Moyo yesterday met the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Lin Lin and discussed issues affecting the media industry. The meeting was held at Prof Moyo’s Munhumutapa Offices.
Sources that attended the meeting told reporters that Prof Moyo shared with Ambassador Lin the printing challenges in Bulawayo.
The source said Prof Moyo highlighted challenges being faced by media houses in importing newsprint from South Africa.The minister is said to have proposed that newsprint be imported from China on better terms and to have a Chinese company providing a printing press for Bulawayo.“Minister Moyo pointed out that Bulawayo is badly serviced in terms of printing,” said the source.
“Minister Moyo said Harare is better serviced especially following the acquisition of new state-of-the-art printing press by Zimpapers.”
The source said Prof Moyo paid tribute to the Chinese government for donating a high technological digital outside broadcasting van to the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation.He said Prof Moyo indicated that the OB van was the first of its kind in the region and countries such as South Africa and Tanzania were keen to hire it.The source said Prof Moyo said although ZBC was privileged to have such modern equipment, he expressed dissatisfaction on the state of the national broadcaster’s studios which are still using analogue transmission.“He (Prof Moyo) expressed disappointment that ZBC was still to digitalise its studios. As such, he said what people watch on ZTV was still of poor quality adding that people were still to see the benefits of the high technological equipment donated by China.”The source said Prof Moyo highlighted that next year Zimbabwe would assume the chairmanship of Sadc and as such, it would be expected to meet the 2015 digitalisation deadline set by the International Telecommunication Union during its chairmanship of the regional body.
He said Prof Moyo said the country needed 48 sites for it to be fully on digital platform and that Prof Moyo indicated that the country was still lagging behind in terms of digital transmission.The source said Prof Moyo also briefed Ambassador Lin on the new economic blueprint adopted by Government which is known as Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio Economic Transformation (Zim Asset).The source said Prof Moyo said the document was still with the printers and it might be launched by President Mugabe sometime next week.
“The minister took Ambassador Lin through the various clusters in that framework and challenges that are there in the area of infrastructural development,” said the source.“He (Prof Moyo) also indicated that Finance Minister Cde Patrick Chinamasa was keen to visit his Chinese counterpart before presenting his 2014 National Budget with a view to mobilise resources.”The source said Ambassador Lin confirmed that everything seemed to be well on course regarding Minister Chinamasa’s visit.
He said Ambassador Lin welcomed Zanu-PF’s resounding victory in the 31 July harmonised elections as it collapsed policy discord manifested by the inclusive Government.Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Ambassador Lin said Beijing was ready to work with Zimbabwe.
“In the area of information and media, we can provide some support to the Zimbabwe side,” he said.“We have provided the OB van for ZBC and we are discussing further some assistance in other areas.

Zimbabwe,5871,theindependent.co.zw,2016-03-24T08:50:47Z,Mnangagwa’s China trip angers Mugabe,"…President still fuming months after VP’s visit
PRESIDENT Robert Mugabe is reportedly angry with Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa over his trip to China last year in which his deputy came out of high-level meetings acting like someone who has embraced Beijing’s push for leadership renewal in Harare and trying to sound like renowned reformist Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
By Elias Mambo
At the invitation of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Mnangagwa visited Beijing from July 6 to 10 2015. During his five-day visit, he met business leaders as well as a number of senior ruling party and government officials, including Chinese Vice-President Li Yuanchao.
Mnangagwa and Yuanchao held closed-door meetings together with CPC officials. The visit, which followed Mugabe’s trip to Beijing in August 2014, was officially said to be designed to “promote political trust and pragmatic co-operation”.
However, diplomatic sources say it ended up generating further political distrust for Mnangagwa from Mugabe who was not happy with what transpired and his deputy’s Deng-like posture afterwards. The late Deng, who took over after Mao Zedong in 1978 until his retirement in 1992, is the architect of China’s far-reaching market economy reforms and prosperity.
Straight-talking Chinese leaders reportedly gave Mnangagwa a sobering reality check when he From Page 1
was in Beijing by raising several critical issues that Mugabe and his government usually feel uncomfortable dealing with.
While moving to ring-fence their growing investment portfolios and future prospects by inviting and engaging the establishment’s preferred successor to Mugabe — Mnangagwa — the Chinese raised a number of concerns on Zimbabwe.
Some of the issues were later expressed by the vice-president in an interview with China’s CCTV.
In the interview with CCTV, Mnangawga said Zimbabwe had fallen far behind other countries in development. He said the government needed to swallow its pride and literally “bite the bullet” by reviewing some controversial economic policies to attract foreign investment.
He also said there was need for reforms “to bring Zimbabwe back to the table of nations”.
“We have to see how we can create an investment environment which will attract the flow of capital. These are the tasks we face and we have to look at even legislation and our social systems need to be reformed in order to catch up with current global trends,” Mnangagwa said.
“So we are looking at the reform measures that China has gone through to help us move forward…
“You cannot say there are areas of our economy which we are happy with, infrastructure we are behind by 15-16 years, agricultural development the same, manufacturing; in fact capacity utilisation in some areas of our industry is down to 20%, so again, we have to retool by acquiring new machinery, technology and machinery so that we are competitive.”
While Mnangagwa’s assertions were viewed as progressive by many Zimbabweans, diplomats and government officials say Mugabe and his close courtiers, especially Zanu PF leaders grouped around his wife Grace, saw them as an attempt to push for leadership renewal using the Chinese while also projecting himself as a viable successor in the Deng mould.
Mugabe, government officials say, also saw Mnangagwa’s remarks as an attack on his leadership and policies, particularly the Look East policy.
“The President was not happy with what Mnangagwa said while he was in China last year,” a senior government official said. “This was also clear during the visit to Harare by (Chinese leader Xi) Jinping last December. So many things were discussed during Xi’s visit. That is why the President said what he said in Bindura last Friday.”
Addressing a rally in Bindura last Friday, Mugabe said some Zanu PF leaders were trying to influence the Chinese to help them in their succession bids, in remarks widely seen as targeted at Mnangagwa.
“Saka ndipo patava kusiyana navamwe ipapa vanobva vaenda mberi mberi nekumaChina kuti takuda president mutsva (That is the main cause of our differences, as some are pushing further to the extent of approaching the Chinese telling them they now want a new leader),” he said.
Mugabe said such plots and agendas were being driven by ambitious party bigwigs who were eyeing senior positions, including the presidency — adding that he was willing to step down if voted out procedurally at congress.
Mugabe made the remarks after Mashonaland Central chairman Dickson Mafios had complained the Chinese were meddling in Zanu PF succession politics in the province.
“Tichavadzvanya mukaona vakuchema chema (We are going to deal with them),” he said.
A top government official said Mugabe exchanged notes with Xi over Mnangagwa’s succession manoeuvres last December, fuelling his long-standing suspicions and hostility towards his ambitious deputy.
The official said Xi, who prefers the Chinese-speaking Grace, is sympathetic to Mugabe, although he believes in leadership renewal and the need for change in Zimbabwe, while Mnangagwa was associated with Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao. Xi succeeded Hu in 2012.
Hu’s good relationship with Mnangagwa was partly because the VP received military training in China in the 1960s and also as a result of the role played Zimbabwe’s former ambassador to China between 2002 and 2006, Christopher Mutsvangwa. Mutsvangwa is a close Mnangagwa ally.
Sources say the Chinese no longer want Mnangagwa, but whoever Mugabe prefers.
High-ranking Zimbabwean officials, from Mnangagwa to Zanu PF provincial leaders, have been to China on various exchange programmes during which they were openly advised to embrace leadership renewal and change.
In 2012, Zanu PF provincial chairpersons visited China for ideological orientation and mass mobilisation training from the CPC ahead of the 2013 general elections.
Chinese officials told them Zanu PF should embrace change or die, something Mnangagwa seems amenable to while Mugabe is hostile to it.
In an interview to mark his 92nd birthday, Mugabe angrily took a swipe at those plotting to succeed him.
“In a democratic party you don’t want leaders appointed that way to lead the party. Saka vaye vanoti pinda iwe ndogozopindawo, kuzvinyepera (those — apparently Mnangagwa and Zimbabwe Defence Forces commander General Constantine Chiwenga) who say rule then I will rule after you are misleading each other).

Zimbabwe,2824,zimbabwesituation.com,2014-08-25T06:50:09Z,Mugabe leaves for crucial China trip,"PRESIDENT Robert Mugabe left Harare Sunday for a five-day trip to China which could prove critical for the country as well as for what could be his last term in office.
The government desperately needs a multi-billion-dollar package to rescue an economy its own advisers warn may be sliding back to the chaos of 2008 and negotiations are understood to have been underway over the last few months with the Chinese government.
But Mugabe’s spokesman, George Charamba, downplayed expectations, saying there was no truth to media reports Beijing would agree a US$4 billion package with Mugabe.
“Variku expecter kuti tichauya nema billion ari munhava (those expecting us to bring billions) don’t know the strategic direction of Zimbabwe. We are looking at ourselves as the investors, we are looking at inward investment,” Charamba told the Sunday Mail.
Mugabe turned 90 this year and although supporters have already started nominating him to be Zanu PF’s candidate in 2018 presidential elections the veteran leader hinted, in an April interview with the BBC, that he would likely step down before that vote.
He won a new five-year term in July last year following elections dismissed as a monumental fraud by main rival and MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai.
But more than a year since the vote, the economy is threatening to seriously undermine what could be his swansong.
There has not been any positive bounce from the landslide election victory while companies continue to close, adding hundreds each week onto the jobless ranks.
Government has no money and struggles to pay its workers every month while its ZimAsset economic programme has failed to take-off due to the lack of funding.
Opposition parties have already been upping the pressure, reminding Mugabe and his Zanu PF party of pre-election promises to deliver over two million new jobs.
But Mugabe has remained optimistic, saying the economy was on the mend.
He recently told anxious Zimbabweans that those claiming otherwise were not in the loop regarding key developments progressing behind the scenes.
“So when we say there is a rise now in the economy, some may not understand it but those inside will understand from the preparations that there are initiatives that have been taken and the resources that are flowing albeit gradually,” Mugabe said in July.
The government is pinning its hopes on help from Beijing.
Chinese embassy officials confirmed negotiations were underway with Harare over a financial package with Beijing open to the deal but insisting on security for its cash.
Several cabinet ministers have travelled to Beijing in recent months with reports a $4 billion deal would likely be sealed during Mugabe’s visit.

Mugabe told Xinhua news agency that he would seek more Chinese investment for infrastructure projects and value-addition for local industries.

Zimbabwe,4004,zimbabwesituation.com,2015-04-20T15:51:52Z,Mugabe flies out yet again,"HARARE – President Robert Mugabe is today set to embark on yet another money blowing globe-trotting journey and this time he is headed for Indonesia for a summit and the commemoration of the formation of the Non-Aligned Movement (Nam).
Mugabe will attend the Asia-Africa Summit and the commemoration of the historic Bandung summit held in Indonesia in 1955, which has brought together Africa and Asia to push forward the struggle for liberation and self-determination.
This week’s summit will mark the 60th anniversary of the Asia-Africa conference, a gathering that laid the foundation for Nam.
Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to attend the Asia-Africa conference, that is being hosted by Indonesian President Joko Widodo.
South Africa President Jacob Zuma has deployed his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa after cancelling his visit to handle matters at home relating to attacks on foreign nationals that has courted international condemnation.
The summit offers Mugabe the prospect of increasing economic integration, not just in Asia but also with other regions.
Sandwiched between the formal summits is the meeting in Bandug where dozens of formal and informal meetings with world leaders will be held to advance Nam interests.
Yuri Thamrin, the directorate general of Asia-Africa relations at the Indonesian Foreign ministry, revealed in a statement this week that “Africa is an opportunity”.
Like Asia, Africa is home to many of the world’s fastest growing economies and a rising middle class, he said, pointing to growth in two-way trade between the regions that jumped from $2,8 billion in 1990 to $270 billion by 2012.
More than 100 world leaders started gathering in Jakarta yesterday to mark the formation of Nam when in 1955, representatives from 29 governments of Asian and African nations gathered in Bandung, to discuss peace and the role of the Third World in the Cold War, economic development, and decolonisation.
Leaders of developing countries banded together to avoid being forced to take sides in the Cold War contest. The initial motivation for the movement was the promotion of peace.
In the 1970s Nam grew increasingly radical in its condemnation of the policies of the Cold War super powers.
But unlike the original gathering, which included mostly Asian participants, this year’s summit will be largely even.
In 1955, the conference was focused on peace, security and economic development at the time of the Cold War.
Sixty years on, the world is very different, and many are asking whether Nam still carries any relevance.
In previous summits, African and Asian nations have agreed on urgent measures to tackle illegal ivory trade — from the slaughter of elephants to the trafficking of their valuable tusks to East Asia.",0,,,"{'None': ['Africa', 'Asia'], 'IDN': ['Republic of Indonesia', 'Bandung', 'Jakarta'], 'ZWE': ['Harare'], 'CHN': ['Tianjin East Asia Hotel']}",diplomatic_visit,['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping']

China is keen to revamp Zimbabwe’s information communication technology and telecommunications sector to ensure that everyone has access to Internet, Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe, Mr Huang Ping has said.
Speaking after paying a courtesy call on Information Communication Technology and Courier Services Minister Supa Mandiwanzira, Ambassador Huang said he wants to see Zimbabwe benefit from its cooperation with China.
“We need to strengthen cooperation in the telecommunications and the internet sector. President Mugabe had a very nice meeting with Chinese President (Xi Jinping) in January. That meeting was quite fruitful, pointing the direction of our cooperation,” he said.
“In the future one of the areas of cooperation is telecommunications. In China we have a saying which goes,‘If you want to be rich build a road’. I think telecommunications is a road connecting people not only in this country but to people in other countries all over the world.”
He said China would like to strengthen this relationship by extending cooperation in all fields relating to telecommunications.
Ambassador Huang said the two countries have already achieved a lot together but he wants all Zimbabweans to have access to Internet.
“We want this country to benefit from our cooperation. All our Chinese companies are the top ones in the world. You can trust them. They will further prove their capability by continuing pending projects. Let us work together to enhance relationship which has been enjoyed for so many years dating back to the liberation struggle,” he said.
Minister Mandiwanzira said Zimbabwe was grateful for China’s continued support in the ICT and telecommunications sector.
“You know that China is a global leader in this specific field and we are working with various companies in China and we have received a lot of great support from China. As you are aware China is a leader in the manufacture of hardware and use of these various technologies that are in the ICT,” he said.
“There has been significant cooperation for many years between Zimbabwe and China in the telecommunications sector and Chinese financial institutions as well as ICT infrastructure companies have been very active in this market working with Government-owned telecommunications companies as well as private sector companies.”
He said Zimbabwe was grateful to China for the support it extended to Government-owned telecommunication companies.
He said of note were two major projects which are being undertaken with support from China Exim Bank.
“TelOne is implementing a $98 million facility project which was granted to Zimbabwe and is being implemented by Huawei and it will see the expansion of services being offered by TelOne, more importantly the deployment of fixed broadband.
“NetOne is just concluding the second phase of its mobile broadband project which has been funded to the tune of $280 million by China Exim Bank and being implemented by Huawei,” he said.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",diplomatic_visit,"['Xi Jinping', 'Chinese']","['Xi Jinping', 'Chinese']","['Chinese', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,2894,herald.co.zw,2014-09-19T00:02:48Z,President Mugabe’s State visit to China unpacked,"The day President Mugabe met Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang in Harare last year
The visit from August 24 to 28 2014 was President Mugabe’s thirteenth Visit to China and third State visit
I. AT the invitation of the Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Robert Mugabe paid a state visit to China from August 24 to 28, 2014. It was President Mugabe’s thirteenth visit and third state visit to China.
During the visit, President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and Mr Zhang Dejiang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China, held official talks with President Mugabe. The two presidents witnessed the signing of nine bilateral co-operation documents such as the agreement on economic and technological co-operation between the two governments and other documents in fields of food, financing, etc.
President Xi held a welcome ceremony including a 21-gun salute, as well as a state banquet for President Mugabe in Beijing. President Mugabe also visited the north-western province of Shaanxi and southern province of Guangdong.
II. This visit is quite successful and fruitful in promoting both political trust and pragmatic cooperation.
Political mutual trust strengthened
Both sides cherish the long friendship between the two countries forged during their glorious days of fighting together against imperialism, colonialism and hegemony. Over the 34 years since the establishment of the diplomatic ties, the two sides have understood and supported each other on issues regarding each other’s core interests and major concern, and have helped each other in their development progress. President Xi Jinping stressed that the Chinese people value friendship and will never forget the old friends with whom China once weathered hard times together and understood and supported each other.
The two sides are ready to work together to carry forward the traditional friendship and strengthen co-operation in various fields. President Xi Jinping said that China and Zimbabwe will continue to be good friends, good partners and good brothers with equal treatment, mutual support, mutual benefit and win-win results and common development. China will continue to stick to principles, uphold justice, and firmly support Zimbabwe in safeguarding its national sovereignty, security and interests of development.
The two sides introduced to each other their domestic political and economic situations and exchanged experience in state governance and administration as well as in reform and opening-up. As China and Zimbabwe are both at an important stage of national construction, and are facing similar development tasks, the two sides agreed to maintain exchanges of governing experiences and learn from each other, so as to improve their own capacity building.
The two sides exchanged views on China-Africa relations and other international issues, and reached broad consensus. As President Mugabe is the chairperson of Sadc and will chair AU early next year, the Chinese side looks forward to seeing Zimbabwe play an even bigger role in African affairs. The Zimbabwean side welcomes China to get more involved in peace and security affairs of Africa, and support Africa’s independent development. The two sides agreed to strengthen coordination and cooperation, jointly promote the all-round transformation and upgrading of the new type of China-Africa Strategic Partnership. They also agreed to enhance communication and co-ordination on international and regional affairs.
Pragmatic cooperation promoted.
China is ready to work together with Zimbabwe to push forward the comprehensive and in-depth development of the bilateral relations to further benefit the peoples of both countries. As President Xi Jinping said, the Chinese side supports Zimbabwe’s efforts to develop the economy and improve people’s livelihood, and will continue to cultivate construction talents for Zimbabwe, discuss with Zimbabwe the cooperation pattern and financing channel of reciprocity and mutual benefit, and pass on and transfer applicable agricultural technologies to help Zimbabwe increase the grain output and agricultural income. China is ready to take part in the construction of Zimbabwe’s special economic zones and industrial parks, to enable them to play a leading role in the cooperation in infrastructure construction, mining industry, manufacturing and other fields, and will encourage more Chinese companies to invest in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe hopes to strengthen cooperation with China and constantly advance the bilateral relations in the new era. The Zimbabwean side welcomes more Chinese enterprises to invest in and more Chinese tourists to travel to Zimbabwe, and will provide convenience for such activities.
According to the signed co-operation documents witnessed by the two presidents, China will provide 1.36 billion RMB (About $218 million) Concessional Loan to fund NetOne Network Expansion Phase II Project, and will provide Zimbabwe with non-reimbursable assistance including emergency food donation. The Exim Bank of China and China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation also signed an MoU with the Zimbabwean Government respectively, through which the Chinese side expressed its willingness to fund viable projects in Zimbabwe.
Before President Mugabe’s visit, the two sides held the Ninth Session of the Joint Commission on Economic, Technical and Trade Cooperation in Beijing, during which they reviewed the economic, technical, trade and investment cooperation between the two countries, noted the common desire of both countries to further promote and expand bilateral economic and trade cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and exchanged views on the priority projects for future cooperation.
During the visit, some Chinese companies also signed tentative co-operation agreements with the relevant Zimbabwean institutions and companies. These agreements are an indispensable step of the cooperation and will lay a solid foundation for the concrete co-operation in the future. For example, Project Joint Development Concerning the Gwayi Coal-Power Integrated Project in Zimbabwe signed by four parties from China and Zimbabwe, provided a framework of co-operation for the two sides to advance the Gwayi Coal-Power Integrated Project.
To facilitate people-to-people exchanges and human resources training, the two sides signed an MoU on Mutual Visa Exemption for Holders of Diplomatic and Service Passports, and an MoU on Co-operation in the Field of Tourism. The Chinese side also committed to fairly increase the number of Chinese government scholarships for Zimbabwean students.
III. President Mugabe’s State Visit to China has great impact on the Sino-Zimbabwe relations. The two leaders have reached important consensus and pointed out the direction for the further development of the bilateral ties.
Now, the two sides should join hands in successfully implementing the outcome of President Mugabe’s visit and lift the Sino-Zimbabwe friendship and all-round cooperation to a new height.

Zimbabwe,2523,zimbabwesituation.com,2014-06-23T08:27:39Z,Chinese VP snubs Zimbabwe again,"HARARE – Chinese vice President Li Yuanchao spent less than an hour in Zimbabwe en route to Zambia for a four-day official visit, were he signed development loan and grant agreements worth $64 million.
Li Yuanchao spent less than an hour in Zimbabwe on Wednesday during a stopover at the Harare International Airport en-route to Zambia for the four-day State visit.
It was not a planned visit to Zimbabwe as Vice president Joice Mujuru had to meet her Chinese counterpart at the airport.
Li Yuanchao is said to have reiterated to Mujuru his country’s commitment to assist financially, the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (ZimAsset).
Zambia will use the funds to improve its water reticulation system in rural areas, upgrade the country’s only international airport in Lusaka and improve education facilities, among a raft of other projects.
From there on, Li Yuanchao will pay a visit to Tanzania to promote economic and trade partnerships.
While Zimbabwe refers to China as its all-weather friend the Asian giant has been busy investing in other African countries.
The recent snub on Zimbabwe has once again reignited the debate on whether the Chinese are indeed our all-weather friends.
China become a major player in the country’s economy through their State-owned enterprises like Anjin Investments — involved in a diamond mining venture in Chiadzwa — and Sino-Zimbabwe Holdings.
According to Global Witness’ report, Anjin has the most lucrative diamond concessions, given in exchange for the $98 million for the construction of the army’s National Defence College.
Prior to these projects, the Chinese were accused of opting for the retail businesses in foodstuffs, household goods and clothing which — apart from crowding out struggling indigenous entrepreneurs and crippling the clothing industry — did not add much value to the country’s economy.
President Robert Mugabe, during his key-note address on Independence Day in April accused the Chinese of flooding the country with cheap labour.
A week later, Presidential Affairs minister Didymus Mutasa blasted China for failing to come on board and help the country revive its economy, adding Zimbabwe was on its own.
Chris Mugaga, economic analyst told the Daily News on Sunday this week that the Chinese are reluctant to come to Zimbabe because of political risk.
“They are avoiding us obviously because there is political risk in Zimbabwe. It is for this reason that they are going elsewhere with their investments,” Mugaga said.
While Maxwell Saungweme, a development analyst, said China was never Zimbabwe’s friend and instead, it is the southern African country that claimed to be in good books with the Asian tiger.
“The issue is the Chinese were never our friends and will never be. We are the ones who tried to befriend them but they don’t see much economic benefits for investing in good relations with Zimbabwe,” Saungweme said.
He added that Zimbabwe does not provide a favourable environment for investors.
“The truth is that in spite of mineral endowments and high literacy levels, we are not an attractive investor destination. The biggest risk investors shun Zimbabwe for is political risk that has been hovering over the country since 2000 when we embarked on land invasions,” he said.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare', 'Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport'], 'ZMB': ['Republic of Zambia', 'Lusaka'], 'TZA': ['United Republic of Tanzania'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",diplomatic_visit,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

China Lesso Group has offered to partner Government in the development of irrigation schemes using the latest technologies that conserve water and are powered by solar energy.
A seven-member delegation from the Chinese firm has been in the country since last weekend. Yesterday, it met Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement Minister Perrance Shiri and officials from his ministry to discuss the possible partnerships.
The delegation was invited by First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa after she visited the company during her recent trip to China.
Addressing the media after the meeting, Minister Shiri said Lesso Group offered solutions that would change the face of agriculture once implemented.
“The company is offering us some smart solutions to our agriculture and it’s introducing to us some irrigation model that uses the latest technologies,” said Minister Shiri.
“They have taken note of the challenges we are facing in respect of power supply and they are proposing that we use solar power for various scales from household irrigation needs up to commercial agriculture. They are also proposing that we use some water saving models of irrigation. You can see that with the drought we had last year and the drought we are experiencing now, the water levels have depleted, so there is need to conserve water hence the technology they are suggesting will be quite handy.”
Minister Shiri said the modalities of any deal would be made public once they agreed on a number of issues.
“Once we finalise the negotiations and the investment involved, we will be able to change the face of agriculture in the country.
“It’s a process (the negotiations). You have to go through all the due diligences and agree on the financing model and the extent of the hectarage covered under the agreed scheme. So it’s still work in progress,” he said.
The minister said climate change had negatively affected the country’s agriculture with farmers risking losses if the current dry spell persisted.
“We are faced with a challenge of climate change and this season we are faced with the prospect of a severe drought, but we hope the situation will improve. Our farmers risk losing their crops, especially those without irrigation. However, those with irrigation facilities also face a challenge of availability of electricity because of the low water levels at Kariba Dam that have affected electricity generation.
“I hope farmers took heed of my call to dedicate some of their land to the growing of traditional grains which can do better in these dry conditions,” he said.
The Chinese delegation toured eight farms in Mashonaland West, Midlands and Matabeleland South to assess the irrigation technologies being used by local farmers. They also toured President Mnangagwa’s Pricabe Farm in Sherwood on the outskirts of Kwekwe.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Kariba', 'Mashonaland West Province', 'Matabeleland North Province', 'Kwekwe'], 'MUS': ['Midlands'], 'USA': ['Sherwood']}",diplomatic_visit,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

Cabinet met in Harare yesterday and President Mnangagwa welcomed Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, who attended his first meeting in almost five months.
VP Chiwenga has been receiving treatment in China and has fully recovered.
He resumed official duties on Monday following his return at the weekend.
According to ZBC News last night, President Mnangagwa expressed gratitude to Chinese President Xi Jinping for the medical attention given to VP Chiwenga.
“I wish to welcome our VP who is back at work after an absence of nearly four to five months,” he said.
“Our VP initially left Zimbabwe for South Africa before going to China in June and after some time, I sent Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Dr Misheck Sibanda and some other officials to go and make an assessment on his condition in South Africa.
“And when they gave me their assessments, I decided to send him to the People’s Republic of China to get medical attention so that he could access the best possible medical attention and care . . . and I am happy with the involvement of the People’s Republic of China.”
Meanwhile, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, Monica Mutsvangwa told journalists during a post-Cabinet briefing that 448 doctors have been fired for continuously refusing to take heed and report for work.
“Pertaining to disciplinary hearings for striking doctors, the Minister (of Health and Child Care Dr Obadiah Moyo) informed Cabinet that 508 disciplinary cases on doctors that have not been coming to work have so far been heard, out of which 498 doctors were found guilty,” said Minister Mutsvangwa.
“It will be recalled that from the previous report, 435 doctors had been discharged, and since then an additional 13 doctors have been found guilty and discharged, bringing the cumulative total of doctors discharged to 448.
“In addition to the 508 disciplinary cases heard by the 25th November 2019, an additional 43 doctors from the provinces are awaiting hearing. Serving of charge letters for 57 senior doctors at Central Hospitals commenced on the 25th November, 2019.”
Minister Mutsvangwa said Government will soon advertise the posts that have fallen vacant following the dismissal of the doctors.
“Regarding the recruitment of doctors, the Ministry of Health and Child Care will publish before the end of this week an advert in the press for all posts that have become vacant as a result of the disciplinary process,” she said.
She added that nurses at Harare City Council clinics were returning to work.
“On the situation at Harare City Council clinics, the Minister (of Health Dr Moyo) indicated that 99 out of the expected 179 nurses turned up for duty as of 25th November, 2019.
“The recent opening of the Edith Opperman Clinic in Mbare has since eased the challenge of home-based deliveries,” she said.
Dr Moyo said 57 senior doctors who have joined the industrial action will also face disciplinary hearings.
“From the information I have from the Health Service Board, those doctors have been charged and will be facing disciplinary action,” said Dr Moyo.
Turning to the violent storms, Minister Mutsvangwa said 19 people have been killed while property worth thousands of dollars has been destroyed across the country.
Eight provinces and 28 districts have reported considerable damage since the start of rains.
“To date a total of 543 homesteads have suffered various levels of damage, scores of internally displaced persons are living with neighbours or relatives while hundreds of schools have part of their roofs blown off.
“Shops and buildings belonging to private companies were also affected and sadly a total of 19 lives have been lost due to falling trees, debris from buildings or lightning strikes,” said Minister Mutsvangwa.
She said assistance will be handled by the respective Urban and Rural Councils, which have also been directed to act with speed and submit all requests for further assistance.
Cabinet has also directed the Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development, Professor Amon Murwira and relevant organisations to conduct a scientific study to establish the exact mapping of the impact of the rainfall induced disasters which seem to be assuming a regular pattern.
“This will facilitate timely interventions to avert loss of lives and destruction of property,” said Minister Mutsvangwa.
On the implementation of the 100-day cycle priority projects that seeks to improve the peoples’ lives, Minister Mutsvangwa said Prof Murwira gave a detailed report covering geo-spatial, aeronautical and space science capability of Zimbabwe and the establishment of the Zimbabwe National Geo Spatial and Space Agency offices for Zimbabwe.
Prof Murwira also gave an update on the need to release funds for the procurement of wildlife satellite collars by the Research Council of Zimbabwe.
Minister Mutsvangwa said on equipping the innovation hubs at the University of Zimbabwe, Midlands State University, the National University of Science and Technology, and Chinhoyi University of Technology, Cabinet notes that the process of procuring equipment at all the innovation hubs has been initiated bringing overall progress of the project to 80 percent.

Though there is a great distance between our countries, our hearts are always together.”Madame Peng added: “I believe that the children of Zimbabwe are the children of China who all have a beautiful dream and I myself and Mama Grace and all the kind of people in the world will do what we can to help them realise their dream.

You have made it to this special place (Mazowe) in Zimbabwe where we look after underprivileged children. We no longer refer to them as underprivileged because they have a home to live, where they have love and are safe.”Cde Mugabe chronicled how she set up the Children’s Home and the Amai Mugabe Junior School with the assistance of the Chinese.“I’m happy that you were able to come and see what your brothers and sisters have done for the Zimbabwean people,” she said.“I would not have been able to do that without that assistance.

The visit came just a week after Chinese military generals visited Harare.Details of the exact nature of the ‘bilateral’ deals with China and Iran have not been disclosed but Iran’s Defence Minister gave a hint went by saying: “We are ready to reinvigorate Zimbabwe's defence power.”This has fuelled speculation, given the claim last week by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai that army chiefs were planning a coup if Mugabe lost elections. Others believe Iran is trying to mine Zimbabwe’s untapped uranium deposits, crucial raw material for its controversial nuclear programme.Last year it was reported Mugabe appealed to China and Russia for protection should a future disputed election be taken to the United Nations Security Council. Mugabe made the appeal while on an official visit to Beijing in November.As for the Chinese generals who were in the country last week, it’s believed their presence might have been to reinforce an existing ‘diamonds for weapons’ deal with Mugabe’s regime.Commenting on the visit, MDC-T MP Eddie Cross said: “I think it is important to note that this delegation were given the full treatment – a convoy of luxury vehicles, motor bike outriders, flags flying and although they were here for three days they did not call on the Prime Minister or see any MDC officials.”Cross said: “China is playing a very serious game here and this sort of exchange reinforces the view that they are in fact backing the worst elements in the old regime and the moves towards some sort of end game that involves violating the GPA and the democratic process.”In his article ‘China, our small friends of little benefit’, political commentator Dr Raymond Chamba says: “China presents to unpopular regimes a complete package of infrastructure investment, trade and political support at the UN and the Zimbabwean engagement is no different.”Chamba argues that China is not interested in the development of Zimbabwe’s mineral resources but in massive extraction of these resources for its own use, while being a generous supplier of small arms and munitions – a practice that has fuelled many African wars. – SW Radio Africa News",1,,,"{'IRN': ['Islamic Republic of Iran'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'RUS': ['Russian Federation']}",security_cooperation,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

“At present, PLA is doing its best to help the ZDF. Because of the illegal sanctions, ZDF is now facing challenges and PLA has provided assistance in the field, in health, office equipment and personnel training.”
Snr Col Ju said every year the ZDF sent almost 100 officers to China for training.
He said China contributed much to the independence of Zimbabwe and since then relations between the two countries blossomed.
“At independence, the two countries established diplomatic relations. As China, we are pleased with the independence of Zimbabwe because China made its contribution to the achievement,” he said.
Turning to the PLA’s 85th anniversary, Snr Col Ju said PLA was founded on August 1, 1927.
He said since then, the PLA — under the leadership of the Communist party — had worked hard to defend the independence of China.
“Since then, the PLA has undertaken the sacred duty of safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity and made great contributions to national development, emergency rescue and disaster relief,” he said.
Snr Col Ju said China had pledged to pursue a road of peaceful development and working with other nations.
He said China remained committed to the policy of no first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe']}",security_cooperation,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,2387,zimbabwesituation.com,2014-05-02T16:11:32Z,Chinamasa ropes in security chiefs on economy,"Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa has turned to security chiefs in his frantic search for a solution to the country’s economic mess, media reports suggest.
A Friday Zim Independent report said the minister briefed the Joint Operations Command, which comprises heads of the army, police, and the intelligence on April 17th.
It is no secret that the finance minister, a lawyer by profession, is out of his depth on economic issues which he now wants dealt with as a security matter.
In March, rumour circulated that ZANU PF leader Robert Mugabe was seriously considering sacking him and replacing him with blue-eyed boy Gideon Gono.
During the meeting with the service chiefs, Chinamasa reportedly told them that he had looked East and West for a bailout but had been snubbed by all the traditional lenders, including ZANU PF ally China.
He repeated the remarks at a business indaba in Bulawayo last week when he said Zimbabwe’s credit record is so bad that no-one wants to lend to the country.
“Whether we go to Zambia or to Malawi, it’s the same thing because we are indebted to these countries. We are on our own and we have to be more innovative,” Chinamasa said.
Retired army major Giles Mutsekwa said by turning to the service chiefs at this key moment, Chinamasa had shown that they are the party’s centre of authority.
“Service chiefs control the politics in ZANU PF and now Chinamasa has confirmed that they also run the economy,” said Mutsekwa.
“They control mining and all of the country’s resources. Maybe Chinamasa is trying to get them to channel the proceeds from these sectors to Treasury.”
Or perhaps as the main players in the business and economic sector, the service chiefs were beginning to feel the effects of the burning economy,” said Mutsekwa, who is also the MDC-T’s secretary for defence.
Political observers say the country’s deepening economic mess is a symptom of the crisis of legitimacy that the ruling party plunged itself into when it stole the ballot.
“We will keep saying it, that they rigged the elections, but now they are failing to rig the economy,” the MDC-T’s Mutsekwa added.
Economist Godfrey Kanyenze said the only solution to the economic problems lies in ZANU PF transforming the way it is governing the country.
“Many lenders are waiting to see how Zimbabwe performs on the IMF debt clearance plan agreed on last year before they can part with their funds,” he said.
Kanyenze said despite the agreement, the government is failing to implement resolutions that will put the country’s economy on the road to recovery and as such, no-one wants “to throw their money into a pit”.
“When an IMF team visited early this year to assess progress they found that Zim had ignored some of the issues agreed on. Issues such as reducing the public sector wage bill and minimising the vulnerabilities in the banking sector,” Kanyenze said.
The ZANU PF government owes international finance institutions $10 billion. The World Bank expelled the country in 1999 over its unsustainable economic policies. The IMF suspended the country in 2001 and subsequently expelled it in 2005 after the ZANU PF regime stopped servicing its debt.
When Chinamasa took over as Treasury chief after his party ZANU PF’s disputed 2013 poll victory, the economy was relatively stable.
Many attribute this stability to the hard work of MDC-T official Tendai Biti, who was the Finance Minister during the life of the negotiated coalition government.
In just nine months the ZANU PF regime, which constantly clashed with Biti over his insistence on fiscal discipline, has driven the economy back to the brink through corruption, reckless spending, and failure to implement sound policies.
The country is also suffering from a lack of investment, with weekly company closures, job losses, capped by hostile indigenisation policies.
Recent utterances by Mugabe, Chinamasa and Indigenisation Minister Francis Nhema suggest that they may be rethinking the policy used to claim a 51% stake in foreign-owned firms, but this has not been backed by any amendment to the law.",0,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Bulawayo'], 'ZMB': ['Republic of Zambia'], 'MWI': ['Republic of Malawi'], 'USA': ['West']}",security_cooperation,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']

Gen Chang was welcomed at the Harare International Airport by Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Government Ministers and service chiefs.
VP Mnangagwa said Zimbabwe was indebted to the leadership of China and Harare valued Gen Chang’s visit.
He said Zimbabwe stood to benefit immensely from the implementation of the projects agreed by the two countries under Zim-Asset.
Gen Chang said he came to Zimbabwe to ensure that all the series of agreements on China-Zimbabwe co-operation signed between the two countries were formulated and implemented.
“China attaches importance to the relations with Zimbabwe and considers Zimbabwe a good friend, good partner, and good brother,” he said.
“My country is willing to strengthen mutual political trust, broaden mutually-beneficial co-operation and boost friendly co-operation.”
Gen Chang latter toured the National Defence College which was built with the assistance of China which advanced a $98 million concessionary loan.
He pledged Beijing’s continued support to Zimbabwe in various areas as part of efforts to enhance the good bilateral relations between the two countries.
“The establishment of the National Defence College is another milestone of Zimbabwe-China relationship,” said Gen Chang soon after signing the visitors’ book and exchange of gifts at the state-of-the-art institution. “Be assured that the Chinese people will do everything to assist Zimbabwe.”
Gen Chang commended the NDC for enhancing skills for military personnel not only for Zimbabwe, but for other African countries which were sending officials to study at the college.
Gen Chang arrived against the backdrop of growing economic ties between the two countries.
President Mugabe embarked on a State visit to China last year where mega deals were signed in almost all sectors, with the Chinese pledging their support.
Several senior Chinese officials have been to Zimbabwe since then to operationalise the deals.
The deals are expected to bring major changes to the country’s infrastructure, agricultural, power generation and other areas.
The signing of the deals was also part of the success of the country’s Look East Policy which took effect after Western countries connived to impose sanctions on Zimbabwe which crippled the country’s progressive policies.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare', 'Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport']}",security_cooperation,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Beijing']"

Zimbabwe,10441,chronicle.co.zw,2019-05-06T00:02:56Z,British PM fires Defence Secretary who planned to invade Zimbabwe,"Lawson Mabhena, Harare Bureau
BRITISH Prime Minister Theresa May has sacked her Secretary of State for Defence who drew up plans to invade Zimbabwe and at least four other African countries – and wanted war with China – a UK paper claiming to have had access to a “leaked National Security Document”, has reported.
Mr Gavin Williamson, who was appointed by PM May in 2017, was fired on Wednesday last week following an inquiry into a leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting, over a plan to allow Huawei limited access to help build the UK’s new 5G network. It is also understood the British premier was unhappy about other indiscretions on the part of Mr Williamson.
The reports about planned invasion of Zimbabwe are strongly redolent of revelations by former South African President Thabo Mbeki in 2013 that Britain wanted to invade the country.
Quoting sources, the Sunday Times said Mr Williamson drew up plans for the British Armed Forces to be sent to “at least five African countries, including Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Kenya and Egypt” while Ministry of Defence officials told the paper that he wanted to “find excuses to send troops”.
“He wanted to invade Africa . . . He made it clear that he was keen to send the troops in,” the paper reported.
An ally of Williamson who spoke to the paper all but confirmed the planed invasion when he said: “The fact that so many knives are now out for him shows that he ruffled feathers in pursuit of defending the armed forces. The prime minister always found it irritating that Gavin was willing to stand his ground when he thought it was in the best interests of the army, navy and air force. She had never done this for the police when she was home secretary and couldn’t work out why Gavin would do it for the military.”
In a meeting with Mr Williamson last week, PM May told him she had information that provided “compelling evidence” that he was responsible for the unauthorised disclosure.
In a letter confirming his dismissal, she said: “No other, credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified.”
The latest revelation on the invasion of Zimbabwe by Britain comes after former South African president Thabo Mbeki in 2013, told Aljazeera that he was under pressure from the Labour regime of Tony Blair to co-operate in a military invasion to depose of former president Robert Mugabe and Zanu-PF in the early 2000s.
Speaking on the programme “Talk to Al Jazeera”, Mr Mbeki said: “There is a retired chief of the British Armed Forces (Lord Charles Guthrie) who said he had to withstand pressure from then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair who was saying to the chief of the British Armed Forces you must work out a military plan so that we can physically remove Robert Mugabe.
“We knew that because we had come under the same pressure that we needed to cooperate in some scheme. It was a regime change scheme, even to the point of using military force and we were saying no.”
Zimbabwe under the Second Republic led by President Mnangagwa has been on an engagement and re-engagement drive focused on new countries as well as those that have been hostile to former president Mr Robert Mugabe’s administration, including Britain.
Speaking after presenting her credentials to President Mnangagwa at State House in January, British ambassador to Zimbabwe Ms Melaine Robinson pledged to boost relations in all spheres.
“The United Kingdom is committed to the success of Zimbabwe. I can reiterate our commitment to everything we can do to help Zimbabwe along the pathway to a brighter and prosperous future in the interests of all the citizens of Zimbabwe based upon strong and sustainable fiscal and economic reforms and human rights. I look forward to working hard and continuing to reinforce the relationship between our two countries for the interests of our people,” Ms Robinson said.",0,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'GBR': ['United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'], 'NGA': ['Federal Republic of Nigeria'], 'KEN': ['Republic of Kenya'], 'EGY': ['Arab Republic of Egypt']}",security_cooperation,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],"['Huawei', 'China']"
Zimbabwe,10853,zimlive.com,2019-09-30T18:03:39Z,Zanu PF spoils for new fight with Mugabe family over plan to turn Blue Roof into museum,"HARARE – Zanu PF has set itself on a new collision course with Robert Mugabe’s family after the party announced plans to convert the former president’s sprawling Borrowdale home into a museum.
The plan was announced by Zanu PF’s secretary for administration Obert Mpofu on Monday, according to the ZBC.
“Mpofu says the party is deliberating on converting the residence of the former president commonly known as the Blue Roof to a museum or something that will benefit the party,” a ZBC report said.
Mugabe family spokesman Leo Mugabe told ZimLive that Mugabe’s widow, Grace, had not been consulted – setting the stage for another bruising fight with the Zanu PF government following a very public row over where the former leader, who died aged 95 on September 6, would be buried.
Zanu PF reportedly owns part of the land on which the Blue Roof was constructed – land which is understood to have been donated to Mugabe to build his retirement home.
But before construction began, according to family sources, Mugabe’s widow who oversaw the Blue Roof’s construction bought several adjacent stands from private landowners.
The financing of the construction, Mugabe previously said, was mobilised from his own savings and donations. The property was constructed by Energro Projects of Serbia, a company which had close links to the Mugabes. The house was completed in 2003.
The 25-bedroom mansion with two lakes and a helipad is commonly referred to as ‘Blue Roof’ for its distinctive Chinese tiles, believed to have been a gift from Beijing.
After weeks of delays, Mugabe was finally buried last Saturday, closing a battle between the state and his family over the fate of his remains.
Mugabe was buried in the courtyard of his rural home at Kutama during a low-key private ceremony attended by less than 250 people. But the decision to finally bury him at a private rural home amid tight security, came after a battle played out for weeks between Mugabe’s family, local traditional chiefs and the government.
Inside the grave, the coffin was placed in a container and then covered with a maroon lid. At its head, “R.G. Mugabe” was inscribed on a yellow plate. Heavy rectangular blocks matching the shape of the grave were piled on top of the coffin.
The original coffin, in which Mugabe’s remains were flown from Singapore, was changed, said family spokesperson Leo Mugabe, the former president’s nephew.
“We wanted a tamper-proof casket because of (the fear of) rituals,” he told the Zimpapers Television Network last week.
Mugabe had told his wife to guard his body once he died for fear it could be used by his opponents for ritualistic purposes, he added.
“People are after his body or his body parts,” Leo Mugabe was quoted as saying.
Family members have said the decision to bury Mugabe at the village was a fulfilment of his wishes.
After much haggling, the family had reluctantly agreed to a government-sponsored special mausoleum at the National Heroes Acre. Its construction was already under way at a public shrine in Harare, where dozens of other liberation war heroes are buried.
But in a surprise about-turn, it was announced the burial was going to be at Kutama village.
It was only at the burial on Saturday that family members explained Mugabe had indicated that when he died, he did not want to be buried at the national shrine because he had been “ridiculed”.
Mugabe was bitter over his ouster nearly two years ago and the role played by his former deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was elected president after Mugabe was toppled.

Zimbabwe,4953,zimbabwesituation.com,2015-10-26T06:25:00Z,Mugabe rejects China award,"PRESIDENT Robert Mugabe has dissociated himself from a peace prize awarded to him by a Chinese institution.
by Staff Reporter
Mugabe was last month awarded the Confucious Peace Prize — a supposed Chinese rival to the Nobel Peace Prize — for his outstanding contribution towards world peace, beating the likes of Microsoft founder Bill Gates and South Korean President Park Geun-hye.
The recognition immediately courted the ire of opposition parties, who said Mugabe did not deserve such a recognition, “given his bad human rights record”.
But State media columnist, Nathaniel Manheru, widely believed to be Mugabe’s spokesperson, George Charamba, said the veteran politician did not recognise the award.
“Not even his system takes note of the so-called award,” Manheru wrote in his weekly column published on Saturday.
“What is more, the Chinese government makes it clear that the so-called award is not affiliated with the Chinese government.
Yet the private Press is agog, together with the opposition it is beholden to, tripping one another to pass severest judgment, hurl the bitterest epithet on the prize, which has nothing to do with Mugabe except ascription.”
Manheru berated the awarding institution, describing it as “little” and seeking to raise its profile by awarding Mugabe.
“The supposed recipient is mum, here even, not a white Confucian. Just what is the story? Even some little institution, so far away from us, seeking to raise its own profile by forcing an association with Robert Mugabe, creates a threatening factor for opposition.”
Contacted for comment yesterday, Charamba confirmed that Mugabe was not following up on the award.
He said the organisers of Confucius Peace Prize had communicated through Zimbabwe’s Embassy in Beijing their wish to honour the President.
“The Chinese government informed the Zimbabwean government it was not associated with the conferring organisation. The matter ended there as far as government and the President were concerned,” he said.
“What the government did not, and should not do, is to stop an organisation wishing to show respect and goodwill from doing so, as best it knows how. The President receives many prizes without even knowing, approving or receiving them. What is dramatic in this case is that oppositional interests drew a revolver at the mentioning of an honour or prize to Robert Mugabe. That is what (former Germany leader Adolf) Hitler did when someone mentioned ‘culture’ to him.
Charamba said despite not accepting the award, Zanu PF spokesman Simon Khaya Moyo was right to laud the honour.
“Cde SK was right to underline that principle and also to acknowlegde the gesture of respect and goodwill towards the President by the conferring institution. That is good diplomacy, good politics,” he said.
Yesterday, Moyo maintained his position that Mugabe was an iconic figure and deserved recognition.
“What I was saying was; no matter where it is coming from, the President deserves it. Those who criticise his recognition are being unfair,” he said.
Zanu PF deputy director of information, Psychology Maziwisa, joined in, saying if Mugabe did not deserve the honour, then no one else did.
In May, renowned South African political analyst, Moeletsi Mbeki described Mugabe as one of Africa’s worst leaders.
He equated Mugabe to Burundi leader, Pierre Nkurunziza, who recently forced a third term despite widespread protests.

Zimbabwe,12040,chronicle.co.zw,2020-11-16T00:03:31Z,A Zimbabwean teacher’s passion for Chinese language brings opportunities,"The ChronicleTafara Mugwara and Zhang Yuliang
CHINESE has been called the language of “extreme” obscurity. The idea of learning the language for many seems alien. But for Herbert Mushangwe, whose Chinese name is Li Kaiming, learning Chinese is an investment for the future.Mushangwe, a professor at the University of Zimbabwe Confucius Institute (UZCI), is the first Zimbabwean to obtain a doctorate degree in the Chinese language.He said his passion for Chinese came from both “positive and negative factors.” The communication challenges he faced during his early days in China, and the fear of going back without solid language skills prompted him to roll up his sleeves.He first made up his mind to study the language after learning of China’s exponential economic growth over the past three decades.By immersing himself in a Chinese environment and befriending as many China-speaking friends as possible, he quickly mastered the language.After acquiring his Master’s Degree in Chinese Linguistics and Applied Linguistics at Tianjin Normal University in northern China, Mushangwe came back to Zimbabwe and became the first-ever local Chinese language lecturer at the UZCI in 2011.In 2012, Mushangwe went back to China where he enrolled for a doctorate degree in Chinese Linguistics and Applied Linguistics at Hebei University. He came back to Zimbabwe in 2015, since then he has devoted his career to teaching Chinese and researching second language acquisition.His passion for teaching coupled with his love for Chinese turned the UZCI into a nursery for language learning and bolstered enrolment numbers.Photo taken on October 2, 2020 shows a Chinese handbook written by Herbert Mushangwe in Harare, Zimbabwe. (Xinhua/Tafara Mugwara)EASIER LEARNING
The access to materials that learners can relate to, or materials that take into account the learners’ environment is key when learning a foreign language, said Mushangwe.The portable electronic dictionaries some Japanese students were using to learn Chinese he saw while he was studying in China in 2017 made him realise the importance of developing a dictionary for Zimbabweans.He then started drafting a Shona-Chinese dictionary, which later became the first Shona-Chinese/Chinese-Shona dictionary ever published. Shona is Zimbabwe’s most spoken language.
Mushangwe said the access to locally produced materials is key to learning a language and achieving high proficiency.His latest handbook, “Introduction to Chinese Characters from a Zimbabwean Perspective,” makes it easier for Zimbabwean students to learn China’s written form.“Your own language is the basis of understanding a foreign language. That’s why we need to develop our local resources which better explains the target language, its terms, grammar patterns and so forth,” he said.Mushangwe has co-authored several books including the first English-Shona-Chinese phrasebook published by the University of Zimbabwe in 2019.
He has also published countless research papers in reputable local and international journals, and has been playing a significant role in developing locally produced materials for learning Chinese.EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS
As the economic strength of China becomes more apparent, the number of students learning Chinese in Zimbabwe has grown by leaps and bounds.Mushangwe said knowledge of the Chinese language and culture can help broaden local employment prospects.“For the young people who want to grow in any career, learning Chinese helps expanding professions,” he said.He believes students with high levels of fluency in Chinese will be in demand in the job market in the years to come.Mushangwe has inspired hundreds of students, many of whom have managed to get scholarships to study in China.ENHANCED TIES
As Africa-China ties continue to blossom under the auspices of the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation and the Belt and Road Initiative, strengthening intercultural communication between the two sides has become imperative.For him, the language is key to enhancing mutual understanding and can be a good motivator in uniting the two cultures.Owing to the influx of Chinese investments in the country, it has become imperative for young Zimbabweans to learn Chinese.As more Chinese businesses flock to Africa, Mushangwe said increased production is closely related to the effectiveness of communication.“It’s not only for the economics,” said Mushangwe. “Politically we need the language, economically we need the language, socially we need the language, culturally we need the language.” — Xinhua",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare']}",professional_cultural_exchange,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['Hebei', 'Chinese', 'Tianjin']","['Tianjin', 'China', 'Hebei', 'CHINESE', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,9738,newsday.co.zw,2018-08-06T00:00:00Z,Guruve Marimba group dance to China,"GURUVE Marimba Dance group from Mashonaland Central province proved their prowess in Dinhe dance to beat the country’s nine other provincial champions to emerge winners of this year’s annual Chibuku Neshamwari traditional dance competition held at Manicaland Showgrounds in Mutare on Saturday.
BY WINSTONE ANTONIO
The dance competition is sponsored by Delta Beverages through their Chibuku brand and co-ordinated by National Arts Council of Zimbabwe, in partnership with Zimbabwe Traditional Dance Association.
For their efforts, the 15-member group who showcased the Dinhe dance, a spiritual animistic dance that is performed to arouse and initiate ancestral communication and dialogue walked away $7 000 richer plus a trip to China for a dance exhibition, while Makare-Kare traditional dance group from Mashonaland East and Bolamba Arts from Matabeleland South pocketed $5 000 and $3 000 for occupying second and third positions, respectively.
This year’s edition of the competition’s finals was dominated by Dinhe and Jerusarema dances, which were showcased by almost half of the groups.
The group’s manager, Zacharia Five, said they were happy to have emerged victors in a tightly contested competition, promising to showcase one of the country’s indigenous dances on a global stage in China.
“I am happy with my group’s efforts, it was not that easy to be the ultimate winners as there was stiff competition. We always worked hard and it is through that determination that saw us winning today [Saturday],” he said.
Zimbabwe National Traditional Dance Association (ZNTDA)’s vice-president Edison Museka said they are confident that the wining group was going to raise the country’s flag high performing the indigenous dance in China as Guruve had a well-documented arts history having, produced various performing artists.
“We are happy that the Guruve Marimba Dance group should go out there as our ambassadors and showcase what Zimbabwe is like in China. With this indigenous dance, which has also been used by Stephen Chifunyise in teaching at different schools across the country, we are promoting indigenous knowledge systems so we are saying, ‘go and make sure you showcase our culture, and carry the real message not to exaggerate,’” Five said.
He said as the ZNTDA, they were also interested in other dances, hence incorporating the dances like the Nyau, Gure and Beni Arinoti dance in Zimbabwe as a way of not segregating other dances in the country.
“The competition is no longer Chibuku Neshamwari Traditional Dance Festival, but it’s now Chibuku Neshamwari Dance Festival as we have married the contemporary dances, the modern dances so that the young people and the youths who are interested in fast and entertaining methods of contemporary dances can be participants in this festival.”
As a way of celebrating Chibuku’s 55th anniversary, the competition partnered with DreamStar Zimbabwe Talent Show to introduce contemporary dance styles.
For this category, ballet dancers Peter Lenso and Ndineyi Alfazima emerged tops and pocketed $3 000 plus a trip to China, while The Chosen got $2 000 for coming second and Forgotten Tribe received $1 000 for occupying third position.
Meanwhile, dancehall sensation Winky D proved why he is regarded as one of the country’s top performers with an energetic performance as he spiced up the event as a guest artiste. The annual dance competition has unearthed a number of talented groups, who have since made names for themselves on the local showbiz.

In an interview at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport just before the delegation’s departure, Cde Machacha said the visit will strengthen cooperation between the two revolutionary parties.
“This is part of our regular cooperation. We are two revolutionary parties that share a rich history. We want to exchange views on party building so that we can strengthen the party.” He said cooperation will also focus on economic matters as Zanu-PF will learn strategies of how the Chinese Communist Party assists its government in running the world’s second largest economy.
“Over the years China’s Communist Party has been crucial in directing the economic policies of the Chinese government.
“We also want to take lessons from this model so that Zanu-PF continues to assist the Government in reviving our economy. This is in line with the promises we made to the people in the 2018 elections to transform our economy.” Cde Machacha said the delegation will also seek to build ideological synergies with the CCP.

THE Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has sponsored 20 Zanu PF youths to attend an ideological exchange programme in Tanzania.
Addressing youths and some Zanu PF supporters during the send-off ceremony held at the party headquarters in Harare yesterday, Zanu PF secretary for finance Patrick Chinamasa urged the youths to be good ambassadors.
He said they would be trained at the Julius Nyerere School of Ideology in Tanzania, where they would meet other liberation movements.
The ideological exchange programme is set to begin today in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
“The Chinese Communist Party always wants us to remain on the revolutionary path and they are sponsoring the 12-day seminar,” Chinamasa said.
Former Zanu PF deputy secretary for youth affairs Tendai Chirau, who is leading the delegation, said: “Former liberation parties will share ideas. Zanu PF is based on ideology and we have always worked with such liberation movements. Remember the Communist Party of China provided weaponry and military training to our comrades so that we attain the independence we are enjoying today. We have Frontline States like Frelimo from Mozambique which are going to be part of the leadership training, and we have worked with such liberation movements.”
Chirau said the leadership training was very important as it fit well with the Africa Day agenda on May 25.

Report by Tinashe Sibanda
The performance that was divided into five parts gave interpretations of various Chinese images and glamour through comprehensive artistic expression.
The energetic group performed colourful displays through song and dance of Chinese legendary stories, with the first conveying the glamour and atmosphere of the prehistoric and beginning of Chinese civilisation.
The highly flexible dancers went on to convey the heroic elements of China with an aim to convey the depth and profundity of Chinese classic aesthetics.
Audiences applauded the various artistic forms and images that were incorporated in the performances, expressing the representative images of China and the uniqueness of its oriental culture.
Audiences clearly expressed amazement over their various artistic expressions including dancing, opera, martial arts and acrobatics, which were incorporated to demonstrate the diversity and dynamics of Chinese culture.
Speaking at the event, Chinese Ambassador Lin Lin promised more Chinese performances in the country.
“This is the third Chinese arts group to perform in Zimbabwe and so far Harare people have been impressed. I promise you that we will be bringing in more performances from China,” Lin said.
Lin handed over a $10 000 cheque from the Chinese Scholarship Fund to the Zimbabwe’s Chinese New Hope Foundation Scholarship. The fund would go towards paying school fees for less privileged children in the country.
Also present to witness the Phoenix Dancing over Oriental Land performance was the outgoing Deputy Minister of Education, Sport and Culture, Lazarus Dokora, among many other guests.

Zimbabwe,14036,herald.co.zw,2023-04-21T00:02:53Z,Zim students bridge language barrier by learning Chinese,"Tafara Mugwara
China and Zimbabwe might be oceans and time zones apart, but through language, the distance is slowly being bridged.
After realizing the importance of Chinese, a language spoken by over a billion people and one of the United Nations’ official languages, Lorraine Nganga decided to learn the language.
“Zimbabwe and China enjoy excellent relations. Many Chinese people come to Zimbabwe to buy things, to invest, and for tourism. Many Zimbabweans also go to China for shopping, to study, and for sightseeing,” Nganga, a Chinese language learner at the Zimgro Language Consultancy in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, said in near-perfect Chinese.
The UN Chinese Language Day is observed every year on the day when the contribution of Chinese literature, poetry, and language is highlighted. As the world marks the day on April 20, learning Chinese is becoming a common trend in Zimbabwe, a largely multilingual country with 16 official languages.
While learning Chinese might seem to be a formidable task, according to Minia Rukucha, another learner, all it takes to master the language is dedication, time, and a suitable learning environment.
“Learning Chinese is very difficult, but I enjoy learning the language, so I will never give up. Although Chinese is very difficult, our instructor’s teaching style makes learning interesting,” said Rukucha in Chinese.
To her, practice makes perfect. “Every day, I read Chinese books, listen to Chinese audio, and watch Chinese movies; (in) that way I can improve my Chinese abilities.”
As China’s global economic footprint expands, demand for Chinese language interpretation services has expanded spectacularly, said Tawanda Zimhindo, a Chinese instructor and Zimgro founder.
“More and more individuals are signing up for lessons most probably because of the fact of the good relationship that exists between Zimbabwe and China right now, and also the fact that banking on that good relationship, more and more Chinese people are coming to do business in Zimbabwe and more and more Zimbabweans are going to China for various reasons.
“So in such interactions, there is a need for language. As long as one has high command of the Chinese language, as long as one has an understanding of the language, there will be more opportunities both in Zimbabwe and outside,” Zimhindo said.
To promote the learning of Chinese in Zimbabwe, the University of Zimbabwe became one of the first institutions of higher learning in Africa to host a Confucius Institute in 2006, and to date, over 16,000 students have attended Chinese language classes. Each year several students are awarded scholarships to further study the language in China.
The Government has also taken various measures to promote the study of the language, including the introduction of Chinese classes in elementary schools, high schools, and colleges.
In an effort to promote studying the Chinese language in Zimbabwe, the Confucius Institute has made various strides in developing learning materials in local languages, including the publication in 2015 of a Shona-Chinese dictionary.
China remains the biggest foreign investor in Zimbabwe, with investments from the Asian country ranging from agriculture, mining, communications, and the energy sector, among others. In addition, China has become a competitive study destination, compared to traditional English-speaking destinations such as Britain, the United States, and Australia.
With the increased economic engagement between Zimbabwe and China, which has seen more young people choosing China as the preferred study destination, the popularity of Chinese among Zimbabwean students continues to grow. – Xinhua",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'GBR': ['United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'], 'USA': ['United States']}",professional_cultural_exchange,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

This will make them the first government schools to teach the language.The schools are expected to start teaching Mandarin at the beginning of next year.A school head in one of the schools, who could not be named as she was not cleared to talk to the press said they were also working with the University of Zimbabwe towards introducing Mandarin.“We expect the technical team to be here by the end of the month. But the plan is that we start teaching the language starting next year,” said the head.Primary and Secondary Education Ministry’s director of communication and advocacy Mr Taungana Ndoro said several schools in the country have adopted the teaching of the Chinese language as part of the four foreign languages being taught in the country.“Proper language learning means learning of the four basic skills which are listening, speaking, reading and writing. Language in the Zimbabwe curriculum comprises 14 indigenous languages, English, Sign and Foreign languages: Chinese, Portuguese, Swahili and French.”Mr Ndoro said while English is taught from infant levels, French is taught from Grade Three classes while Portuguese, Chinese and Swahili are at secondary level.Primary and Secondary Education Permanent Secretary Mrs Tumisang Thabela said the teaching of Mandarin is more pronounced at private schools at the moment.She said those who learn foreign languages are likely to get more opportunities in the global village where nations trade more.Mrs Thabela said Government is training pupils that can compete on a global stage.“Currently I can say it’s mainly private actors who can afford to pay extra teachers to give them foreign languages. In the public system we still do not have much of that,” said Mrs Thabela.“Today’s child has to be given skills to live anywhere and thrive anywhere. The Chinese economy is one of the strongest currently. So, Mandarin comes in because trade is now much alive to goods and products. Most of our goods in our houses have a lot of Chinese that we cannot read and they have a lot of wrong translations,” said Mrs Thabela.“So, for those children who are looking beyond Zimbabwe, beyond their boundary Mandarin becomes one of the options. Definitely it will give them an edge.”Lupane State University (LSU) senior lecturer in the Languages Department Dr Busani Maseko said the teaching of Chinese language is an acknowledgement of the global influence of China.He said going forward, Chinese Mandarin will be a language of opportunity.“It’s not just the spread of the Chinese language but the spread of the influence of its speakers. The Chinese influence is increasing not just in Zimbabwe but in Africa in general, South America among other continents. China is fast becoming a global power house and its language is spreading just like How the English language spread,” he said.“English language spread not because it was a powerful language but because it was spoken by the globally powerful economies, for example the United States of America and the United Kingdom.”",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa', 'South America'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Bulawayo'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'GBR': ['United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland']}",professional_cultural_exchange,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese']

Herald Reporter—
Female Student Network Trust (FSNT), an organisation that advocates the rights of female students in tertiary institutions, raised the national flag high when it won the first edition of the unesco Prize for Girls and Women’s Education.FSNT and the Directorate of Early Childhood Education in the Indonesian ministry of Education beat 51 other nominees to land the prestigious global award.
The two laureates will each receive an award of $50 000 at an official ceremony in Beijing, China, next week. The prize is funded by the Government of China. In a statement, unesco director-general Mrs Irina Bokova announced the two laureates of the first edition of the global prize in recognition of their innovative projects.
FSNT was recognised for its initiative titled “Empowerment of Tertiary Education Female Students through Leadership Development and Mentorship Programmes.”
The initiative stems from a baseline survey which explored the indicators, prevalence and awareness level of sexual harassment within learning environments, particularly in tertiary education. It advocates improving the accountability of authorities in creating favourable learning environments for girls and women.
The organisation works with Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development and Women’s Affairs ministries and carries out policy, advocacy, counselling and legal support as well as mentorship programmes.
The Indonesian Directorate of Early Childhood Education was rewarded for its project: “Improving Access and Quality of Girls’ Education through Community-Based Early Childhood Education and Early-Year Gender Mainstreaming”.
“The two organisation will each receive an award of US$50 000 during an official ceremony in Beijing, China, as part of an international seminar on girls and women’s education from 4 to 8 June 2016,” said Mrs Bokova.
She said the unesco Prize for Girls and Women’s Education was established by unesco’s executive board last year to honour the outstanding contributions and innovations of individuals, institutions and organizations engaged in promoting and advancing girls and women’s education.
“It is the first UNESCO prize to address this theme,” said Bokova. “The prize contributes to the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals four on education and five on gender, quality and supports UNESCO’s global priorities included in the Medium-term Strategy 2014-2021 and the Gender Equality Action Plan 2014-2021 (GEAP11).”
Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development Minister Professor Jonathan Moyo commended the FSNT for its efforts which earned the organization international recognition.
He said the award was not for them alone as an organisation but for the nation at large.
Prof Moyo described the award as a “very instructive intervention” calling the government’s attention to serious problems bedeviling the country’s higher and tertiary education institutions. “There is need for these institutions to come up with viable policies to deal with the problem of sexual harassment,” he said.
“We understand that generally the expectation would be for these institutions to deal with this challenge themselves as part of their responsibility. They do indeed try but it is not always the case that higher and tertiary institutions prioritise interventions that address the problem.
“It is therefore significant that we get a complementary role from civil society that education is not just the responsibility for the institutions, but it is a collective responsibility. That society creates a conducive learning environment.”
The call for nominations was made on March 8, the day set aside for commemorating International Women’s Day. The laureates were seclected by the director general of UNESCO on the basis of recommendations of an international jury that met on May 4 and 5.
A total of 53 nominations were submitted to the UNESCO from around the globe. Zimbabwe submitted three nominees—Campaign for Female Education (CAMFED) Zimbabwe, FNST and Shamwari Yemwanasikana.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare']}",professional_cultural_exchange,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing']
Zimbabwe,13726,herald.co.zw,2022-09-09T00:02:23Z,Zim academic gets careers moving with Chinese skills,"Nkosana Dlamini
A Zimbabwean academic has seen brisk business from compatriots keen to learn Chinese at a school he opened in Harare to tap demand from those who see proficiency in the language as a way to advance their careers.
The Zimgro Chinese Language Consultancy was set up by Tawanda Zimhindo, who also lectures at the University of Zimbabwe’s Confucius Institute, which offers Chinese language and cultural programs.
With many prospective students unable to gain acceptance at the university amid high demand, Zimhindo saw there was an opening for a Chinese school.
“I opened Zimgro and lowered the entry requirements to accommodate those who do not meet the minimum entry requirements,” said Zimhindo, now 33, who majored in teaching Chinese language and culture at Chinese universities between 2012 and 2017.
Zimgro has been churning out graduates and currently has 140 students on the books.
The demand among students to learn Chinese has been driven by a surge in the number of Chinese companies now operating in Zimbabwe. These companies need locals with Chinese-language skills.
“If you have a proper understanding of their language and culture, it won’t take you hours to get the job because whenever there is a Chinese company, there is obviously a job for an interpreter,” Zimhindo said.
“Chinese companies turn to them in terms of interpreters. We have a long list of Chinese firms looking for interpreters, looking for human resources workers who speak a bit of Chinese, and the same for managers who also speak some Chinese language. We can’t even supply enough of them.
“Those who can speak the language have greater chances of employment.”
However, Zimhindo said it’s not enough for students to just know the Chinese language, as they must also have an understanding of the culture of their prospective employers.
“The major emphasis is language but for one to master the language, one also has to master the culture to bridge the communication gap between Chinese and Zimbabweans,” he said. “We teach the cultural meaning of time, of food, the cultural meaning of just a visit by a Chinese friend. We are not content to deal with just the surface value.”
In Zimbabwe, there have been some conflicts between Chinese employers and local workers, and Zimhindo attributes these incidents to cultural misunderstandings.
“Here in Zimbabwe, our working culture emphasizes the time spent as opposed to one’s work output. Chinese people are target-oriented and are hard workers,” he said. “What sometimes results in conflict at workplaces comes down to the fact that our work culture is different.”
Among those who have benefited from Zimhindo’s school is Anesu Rachel Chiveso, who works as an interpreter at Chinese-owned Maxmind Investments Zimbabwe.
“Learning Chinese language and culture changed my life in that I could be hired easily by any Chinese company,” Chiveso said.
“Here at my workplace, there are situations that need an appreciation of Chinese culture.”
Zimhindo has also inspired his younger family members to learn Chinese. They too have been to Chinese universities.
One of them, Loveness Zimhindo, said she took up Chinese language and culture to enhance her employment opportunities.
“When I enrolled at the University of Zimbabwe, we were approximately 300 students learning the same major . . . I thought of differentiating myself through learning Chinese language,” she said.

A Chisipite Senior School student in Harare whose painting now graces the China Space Station after winning the My Dream of Going to Space painting competition is in China to receive the Tainhe Award.
Hope Mafiko is among seven winners representing seven African countries and she will receive her award at a prize giving ceremony in Beijing today.
Other countries represented include Madagascar, Nigeria, Mali, Democratic Republic of Congo and Algeria.
Hope, who is accompanied by her mother Mrs Esperanca Mafiko was full of joy for her artwork being selected from a pool of more than 2000 participants across Africa.
“I am excited because representing my country has opened up doors including being able to visit China,” she said.
“It’s something I just challenged myself to try after our teacher showed us the poster inviting us to come up with a painting centred on a dream to go to space.”
The competition was organised by the Chinese Follow-up Committee of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the China Manned Space Engineering Office and the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe.
Other embassies and consulates in African countries also coordinated the competition.
Mrs Mafiko said Hope has always been artistic as a little child and she had to buy her colours.
“She has always shown an interest in art from a very young age. When I received the call of her having won the competition I had to park on the side of the road because of excitement,” said Mrs Mafiko.
They both contend that China and the people’s hospitality was extraordinary.
Hope said her perception of China had changed completely as the infrastructure, ambience, greenery and widespread use of energy efficient vehicles had blown her away.
The winners have been taken of trips to witness China’s beauty, including touring the Great China Wall.
They were also introduced to Wushu, a Chinese martial art form, which rides on the principle of attack and Defence.
Proponents of the art form have gained worldwide a claim including Bruce Lee, Jet Li and Jackie Chan among others.
Professor Zhou Qingjie of the China Foreign Affairs University took the 10 winners and at least six journalists from the winning countries through their paces.
Prof Qingjie said Wushu and Tai Chi emphasised the perfect balance and harmony between nature and humans.
“We always seek to establish a perfect balance between nature and humans. Wushu and Tai Chi are key in maintaining the body, mind and soul healthy,” said Prof Qingjie.
“These Chinese martial art forms promote the use of mind over power. It also rides on the philosophy that humans learn from nature including animals. From animals we learn that different animals have different strengths and tactics of attack and defence.”

When classes begin, she logs on to Microsoft Teams, an online communication and collaboration platform that allows people to work together online.
To keep her students actively engaged during the virtual classes, Mudzonga makes sure that there is maximum participation of all students and regular responses from them, which provide valuable insights into their opinions and help her understand their grasp of the content.
The virtual environment, in Mudzonga’s view, ensures that students, safely and comfortably at home, can interact and make contributions as much as they do in face to face classes.
Primary and secondary schools in Zimbabwe closed in March due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, just a week before the end of the first term.
“We realized that if we fail to teach them during this lockdown, exams will still come and they will have nothing to write,” she told Xinhua.
But she also admited that not all her students can attend the online classes regularly. “Some of them are less privileged and they cannot afford data bundles every day. So sometimes they attend two classes per week or three classes per week,” she said.
The move to conduct Chinese language lessons online was prompted by the fact that there has been a rising demand from students seeking to learn the language.
Mudzonga said the influx of Chinese businesses in Zimbabwe over the past years has made the ability to speak Chinese a great selling point in the job market.
Economic engagement between China and Africa has expanded exponentially over the years. As Zimbabwe continues to cement its bilateral relations with China through increased economic engagement, opportunities also grow within the frameworks of the Belt and Road Initiative, and the Forum on Africa-China Cooperation, therefore there has been a pressing need to know Chinese language, history and culture.
Zimbabwe’s Look East Policy was adopted in 2003 with the aim to expand bilateral and trade relations with China. The country has seen a surge in the number of parents sending their children to learn Chinese.
One of Mudzonga’s students Rumbidzai Mundeta said the ability to use Chinese language offers many opportunities. “When you know a different language, jobs tend to became more likely to be obtained.

SOME schools in Bulawayo are set to introduce Chinese language, expanding their learning areas as the country’s education system adopts more foreign languages in a bid to create globally competitive citizens.
Montrose High School and Nkulumane High School are finalising the introduction of Mandarin at the learning institutions to arguably become the first government schools to teach the language.
The teaching of Mandarin is expected to start at the beginning of next year at the Bulawayo schools.
Since the turn of the millennium, Zimbabwe has increased trade and deepened bilateral relations with China and an increasing number of Zimbabwean students studying in the Asian giant.
Some Chinese nationals have established companies in Zimbabwe, with China involved in major infrastructure projects in the country such as the construction of Lake Gwayi Shangani and the new parliament of Zimbabwe building as well as the upgrading and rehabilitation of Hwange Unit 7 and 8 power stations.
The execution of these national projects has also led to transfer of knowledge between Zimbabweans and Chinese experts working on the projects.
In Bulawayo, Hillside Teachers College is already teaching Mandarin.
Speaking during a Hillside Teachers’ College graduation ceremony two weeks ago, the college’s principal Mrs Linda Sibindi said the college was working with Nkulumane High School and Montrose High School to introduce the Chinese language.
A school head in one of the schools, who cannot be named as she was not cleared to talk to the press said they were also working with the University of Zimbabwe towards introducing Mandarin.
“We expect the technical team to be here by the end of the month. But the plan is that we start teaching the language starting next year,” said the head.
Primary and Secondary Education Ministry’s director of communication and advocacy Mr Taungana Ndoro said several schools in the country have adopted the teaching of the Chinese language as part of the four foreign languages being taught in the country.
“Proper language learning means learning of the four basic skills which are listening, speaking, reading and writing. Language in the Zimbabwe curriculum comprises 14 indigenous languages, English, Sign and Foreign languages: Chinese, Portuguese, Swahili and French.”
Mr Ndoro said while English is taught from infant levels, French is taught from Grade Three classes while Portuguese, Chinese and Swahili are at secondary level.
Primary and Secondary Education Permanent Secretary Mrs Tumisang Thabela said the teaching of Mandarin is more pronounced at private schools at the moment.
She said those who learn foreign languages are likely to get more opportunities in the global village where nations trade more.
Mrs Thabela said Government is training pupils that can compete on a global stage.
“Currently I can say it’s mainly private actors who can afford to pay extra teachers to give them foreign languages. In the public system we still do not have much of that,” said Mrs Thabela.
“Today’s child has to be given skills to live anywhere and thrive anywhere. The Chinese economy is one of the strongest currently. So, Mandarin comes in because trade is now much alive to goods and products. Most of our goods in our houses have a lot of Chinese that we cannot read and they have a lot of wrong translations,” said Mrs Thabela.
“So, for those children who are looking beyond Zimbabwe, beyond their boundary Mandarin becomes one of the options. Definitely it will give them an edge.”
Lupane State University (LSU) senior lecturer in the Languages Department Dr Busani Maseko said the teaching of Chinese language is an acknowledgement of the global influence of China.
He said going forward, Chinese Mandarin will be a language of opportunity.
“It’s not just the spread of the Chinese language but the spread of the influence of its speakers. The Chinese influence is increasing not just in Zimbabwe but in Africa in general, South America among other continents. China is fast becoming a global power house and its language is spreading just like How the English language spread,” he said.
“English language spread not because it was a powerful language but because it was spoken by the globally powerful economies, for example the United States of America and the United Kingdom.”
Dr Maseko said China is already upstaging the US economy in terms of its gross domestic product which means that more nations will trade with it hence the need to learn Chinese language for enhanced communication in doing business.
He said the Chinese language will be more relevant in Zimbabwe considering the increasing trade relations between the two friendly nations.
“As you might be aware, some of the big projects in Zimbabwe are done by the Chinese. So, the local population has to be able to communicate with the Chinese,” he said.
Dr Maseko said learning Mandarin will have a competitive advantage for job seekers.
“Our local people who would have acquired Chinese can have increased employment opportunities in the country when they also take up Chinese teaching posts,” said Dr Maseko.
He however warned that while adoption of Mandarin was a welcome development, there is a need to strengthen the learning of indigenous languages, which have not gained traction despite being introduced in schools.
A language expert who also teaches Chinese language at one of the country’s universities who could not be named as they were not cleared to speak to the press said the teaching of Chinese language is mutually beneficial to both nations.
“The increase in trade and bilateral relations is not one-sided but mutually beneficial for both countries. We have our citizens who are going to study in China and the Chinese here who have established companies are creating job opportunities. They have also started to appreciate our culture,” said the expert.
She said the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education should consider revising the stages of introducing the language in schools.
She said as opposed to introducing the language at secondary level, learners need to learn it at infant level and this will relieve pressure from universities from teaching the language basics at tertiary level. — @nqotshil",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa', 'South America'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Bulawayo', 'Nkulumane'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Montrose']}",professional_cultural_exchange,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,14488,thezimbabwean.co,2023-11-03T19:50:59Z,Zimbabwe’s Third Generation Feminists after Covid-19,"Debating Ideas aims to reflect the values and editorial ethos of the African Arguments book series, publishing engaged, often radical, scholarship, original and activist writing from within the African continent and beyond. It offers debates and engagements, contexts and controversies, and reviews and responses flowing from the African Arguments books.Zimbabwe has a rich and nuanced history of women’s rights activism. The works of Hope Chigudu, Shereen Essof, Everjoice Win, Patricia McFadden, Fungai Machirori and many others analyse the motivations, modes, successes, and challenges shaping Zimbabwe women’s organising and movement building. This piece documents the dynamic nature of the collective mobilising by women activists, professionals, and ordinary women driven to transform power relations in the patriarchal and conservative Zimbabwean society.The report Resilience in Adversity: The changing face of women’s activism in Zimbabwe 2000–2014 explores the status of women’s activism in Zimbabwe, and its persistent nature as the actors and organisations collectively pursue gender equality and women’s rights. It reveals the multi-generational dynamic within the movement.Generation 1: “Beijing generation” (a reference to those activists who were part of the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action). Women activists and professionals within the movement during the 1980s–1990s. This generation politicised women’s rights agenda and mobilised to challenge power. Whilst the liberation struggle addressed racial inequities and colonial forces, discrimination against women and girls persisted in the post-independence era. Operation Clean Up of 1983 demonstrated how state power and patriarchy colluded to restrict women’s movement in public spaces and rehabilitated them. State authorities conducted raids nationwide, arbitrarily arresting women as they removed “prostitutes from the street”. However, sex workers weren’t the only women arrested. Over 6,000 women of different professions and ages were arrested.Strong collaboration between academia, civil society, women’s groups, political parties, and state machinery worked to lobby and advocate for policy and legal reforms. For example, the 1982 Legal Age of Majority Act recognised women legally as adults. For the first time, women could own property, enter contracts, and make legally enforceable decisions without male consent. In response to Operation Clean Up, a women’s pressure group, Women Action Group emerged. They held workshops and public meetings to challenge violations of women’s rights and create spaces for women to speak about their experiences.Not only did the women’s movement tackle cultural nationalist discourse but they also contended with the gendered impacts of global neoliberal liberalisation and structural adjustment in Zimbabwe. In 1990, the government implemented economic structural adjustment programmes (ESAP), eroding the social development and opportunities citizens enjoyed in the first decade of independence. As with several countries across the developing world, Zimbabwe implemented imposed conditionalities set by the World Bank and IMF. This resulted in the privatisation of state entities, extensive liberalisation of price and import control, and reduced public spending on education, health, and other social services.Noting mass retrenchments, increased poverty and reduced social welfare, women’s organisations criticised the economic policy. Organisations such as Zimbabwe Women’s Finance Trust and Zimbabwe Women in Business advocated and mobilised on women’s economic interests. Eerdewijk and Mugadza note that the language of gender and development evolved within the movement. Gender mainstreaming emerged as a critical tool in advocacy whilst sexual and reproductive rights emerged as new areas of activism.Generation 2: Professionalisation of women’s rights work. By 1995, over 25 women’s rights organisations were registered. These organisations advocated, mobilised and documented various aspects of women’s rights issues within urban and rural areas. The second generation emerged at a difficult political moment in Zimbabwe’s history. From 1997–2000, two competing processes of constitutional reform occurred. In 1997, a collective of academia, CSOs, churches, trade unions and others sought to draft a new people-centred, democratic constitutional development process. It was a key tool to improve the rights of women. In 1999, the government aimed to overtake this process and started its own process, which was disputed by some National Constitution Assembly members. As a result, the draft constitution was rejected. The unsuccessful constitutional reform process of the year 2000 contributed to the fragmentation of the collaborative and collective women’s rights position. This moment’s impact includes the adoption of gender equality language over women’s rights and issue-based rather than cross-cutting approaches.Eerdewijk and Mugadza define the 2000s as the decade of many elections. Elections were held in 2000, 2005, 2008 and 2013. The women’s movement was weakened by the political polarisation and electoral violence which shaped the 2000 elections. Essof notes that many women’s rights activists went underground after these elections as women’s bodies were sites of political warfare. It is in this context of fragmentation and political polarisation that the second generation of women’s activists emerged. This cohort of women’s rights activists entered established women’s organisations and  continued the critical work of the movement.Generation 3: Younger radical feminist generation. Emerging from 2005 onwards, this generation found itself in the context of multiple waves of rapid economic decline from the mid-2000s. As previous generations of civil society contended with state economic policies and growing corruption through lobbying, advocacy and documentation, the younger generation pushed for more confrontational approaches with the state authorities. Chitapo contends that the 2013 election defeat by the opposition party, MDC, contributed to citizens’ fatigue with opposition politics. Rather than seeking political change through electoral processes, social movements such as Occupy Unity Square and Hashtag movements like #ThisFlag emerged as critical avenues for collective action. Whilst often dispelled by state authorities, these surges of political protest provide space for Zimbabweans to express their discontent with the political and economic situation.Young radical feminists address the gendered impact of economic and political collapse on women and girls. The country’s month-on-month inflation rate in June 2023 was 74.5%, a substantial increase of 58.8% from May’s rate of 15.7%. As inflation spirals, tax injustice affects women’s and girls’ ability to benefit from public services such as hospitals, clinics, and schools. It greatly impacts the provision of sexual and reproductive health services. Muchena argues that corporate companies such as mining firms’ failure to pay taxes results in the underdevelopment of communities. In the absence of social security nets, women’s unpaid care work increases.These realities are compounded by the anti-poor and anti-worker policies adopted by the state. In January 2023, the government enacted the Health Services Bill. This law forbids health workers who are classified as an “essential” service from striking for more than three days. Those who do not comply face a fine or imprisonment of up to six months. This emerged as health workers engaged in persistent strikes due to poor pay and deteriorating working conditions.Eerdewijk and Mugadza state that this generation finds itself in a highly politically polarised country where sexual violence is used as a tool of repression by state bodies and political actors. Gendered and sexual violence occurs online and offline in Zimbabwe. For women within the political sphere, gendered and sexual violence is used to control and dissuade women from public office. However, this violence is not restricted to established and aspiring female leaders. UNPFA states that in Zimbabwe, about one in three women aged 15 to 49 have experienced physical violence and about one in four have experienced sexual violence since the age of 15. Women face sexual harassment within public spaces such as streets, public transport, markets, and workplaces. This violence also exists within the home.Eerdewikj and Mugadza argue that within this difficult context, young women reclaim and own feminist labels. They also establish their own formal and informal feminist collectives to address issues that affect them. Modes of organising include technology and social media. Whilst using these platforms, they incorporate traditional art, documentaries, poems, and short storytelling into their advocacy. There is a strong emphasis on telling their stories within private and public spaces.This piece seeks to add to Eerdewijk and Mugadza’s categorisation of the third generation of Zimbabwean feminists. The analysis draws on the insights from the literature on young women’s activism, feminist movement building, and trends within Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) funding. It is also based on my experience working with different young feminist collectives advocating on SRHR during the Covid-19 pandemic.Given this categorisation of young women activists in Zimbabwe, and particularly those advocating on SRHR issues, my text seeks to address two questions. First, how did they mobilise for better SRHR outcomes during the height of the pandemic? And second, I outline the successes and challenges faced by this diverse collection of actors and organisations. Longstanding SRHR issues in the country include access to safe abortion, teenage pregnancies, and early forced child marriages, gender-based violence, homophobia and transphobia, and the neglect of SRHR needs of persons with disabilities and sex workers. Access to safe abortionThe provisions of the Termination of Pregnancy Act and the Criminal Law Codification Act clearly set three conditions under which abortion can be conducted. These conditions are limited to when pregnancy is deemed endangering to the life of women and their physical health, if the fetus suffers impairment and in the case that the pregnancy is a product of rape or incest.Pregnancies can only be terminated by a medical practitioner authorised by a court order. Any abortion done outside that is punishable. As 40% of pregnancies in Zimbabwe are unintended, 25% of these unintended pregnancies result in unsafe abortions. During the pandemic and national lockdowns, women and girls had even more reduced access to post-abortion care. Movement restrictions made it difficult to access sexual and reproductive services as they were not regarded as essential services. The threat of physical violence by security officers made it even more difficult for women including sex workers to travel for SRHR services and pursue livelihood activities. Amnesty International observed that restricted access to maternal care and safety concerns deterred women across the country from getting necessary maternal health assistance. Teenage pregnancies and child marriagesClosure of schools and safe community spaces resulted in increased sexual exploitation of young girls. Between January and February 2021, the Zimbabwean government reported that 5,000 teenage girls were impregnated. Chiweshe and Bhatasara’s study on sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in Epworth notes that forced sexual activity was perpetuated by both the youth and older men. The government’s report adds that 1,800 girls entered early and forced child marriages. Early and forced child marriages emerged as negative coping mechanisms for households during emergency situations such as health pandemics and climate disasters. These situations are marked by income loss as household members could not travel for work or trade in public places. Girls within rural and urban spaces lost opportunities to gain critical SRHR information about bodily autonomy, social protection and menstrual health and hygiene. Gender-based violenceThe pandemic resulted in abused women across the globe experiencing lockdown with their abusers. The shadow pandemic of domestic violence saw a global increase of SGBV as governments aimed to reduce the spread of Covid-19. In Zimbabwe, the national GBV Hotline (MUSASA) recorded a total of 6,832 SGBV calls from the beginning of the lockdown on 30 March until 15 December 2020. This was an increase of 40 per cent compared to the pre-lockdown period. The forms of violence ranged from physical to financial abuse. It’s important to acknowledge that young women human rights defenders and young feminists in Zimbabwe are not a homogenous group. The third generation of the women’s movement has established its own formal organisations, and is working on established organisations/coalitions whilst others are coming together to take collective action as young women through informal networking platforms. There is a strong humans right based approached to their mobilisation, but their interpretation and prioritisation of SRHR differ. Community buildingA diverse group of activists and organisations employ advocacy and campaigning as key tools for the realisation of SRHR. During an interview in 2022, Hazel Jojo,* a young Zimbabwean feminist organiser stated that young women activists use creative advocacy tools to openly talk about contraceptives, HIV and AIDS, gender-based violence, and early and forced child marriages. Creating safer platforms specifically for young women and girls has offered space for information sharing while they gain other skills.Natsiraishe Maritsa, founder of the Vulnerable Underaged People’s Auditorium Initiative, has been teaching her peers about the dangers of early pregnancy and early marriage while giving them self-defence lessons. An organisation that I’ve worked with, Youth Africa Vibes, runs a mentorship programme for girls and young women in Warren Park, Harare. The programme, “She’s Activated”, switched its mentorship and SRHR capacity workshops to WhatsApp during the pandemic. These young women-led organisations were working prior to Covid-19 but had to adapt to the realities of the moment. Instead of having physical meet-ups at their local community halls or homes, they opted to connect regularly on WhatsApp with their community.For other activists, the lockdown period offered them the opportunity to expand and document their existing initiatives. A youth led organisation I interacted with strongly focused on improving girls’ understanding of menstrual health and addressing period poverty. Girl UP Zimbabwe hosted workshops teaching girls how to make and use reusable pads. They recently also developed sexual reproductive health and rights booklets that are distributed during their workshops. They hope to scale up the project by printing them in indigenous languages and publishing a digital version. From my observation, grassroots mobilisation is strongly built on relationships and creating safe spaces, especially for activists and communities that face scrutiny in Zimbabwe, and which the pandemic greatly curtailed. Subverting and creating narrativesSocial media and digital messaging platforms are tools for young women activists to mobilise and shift the narratives on SRHR. It also enables them to link with other activists within the region and globally as they build solidarity across networks. As movement restrictions in Zimbabwe affected programming, some activists took to online spaces such as Twitter, Facebook, WordPress, Medium and YouTube to disseminate information about reproductive and sexual health.  The organisation Miss Deaf Pride often uses its Facebook page to give visibility to women and girls with disabilities on SRHR issues. During the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, the organisation had a video campaign demonstrating how to sign gender-based violence, spotlighting GBV issues affecting persons with disabilities.Digital activism does not occur in isolation. Whilst backlash emerges against “Twitter Feminists” and “keyboard activists”, this valid form of activism is often coupled with offline activities. Feminist Voices Zimbabwe (FVZ) is a youth and queer led organisation strengthening gender advocacy through storytelling, documentation, and dissemination of information. FVZ’s founder  Tinastwe Mhaka began blogging to highlight the gaps within Zimbabwean law as it has not adequately been developed to realise the full SRHRs of women, girls, non-binary and trans identifying persons. The legislation on abortion in Zimbabwe is one of FVZ’s advocacy areas. The organisation’s campaign 80000toomany is  an abortion storytelling project to demystify and de-stigmatise abortion, with the broader goal of strengthening lobbying, resource mobilisation and facilitating creative collaboration to decriminalise and avail support for safe abortion in Zimbabwe. Part of this storytelling project included convening spaces for activists and interested individuals to learn more about the pathways to safe abortion. In May 2023, the organisation hosted a Safe Abortion Fair to raise awareness about safe unrestricted abortions. The fair included panel discussion and exhibition stalls from other feminist organisations working on SRHR in Zimbabwe.There is also engagement with decision-makers to address existing gaps in delivery of SRHR services. Young activists and professionals seek to assist in gaps and causes for further action by duty bearers to ensure better youth friendly services that call on senior management to create learning and work environments that are free from violence, coercion and abuse. From 2010 to 2020, the African Gender Institute at the University of Cape Town ran the Young Women’s Leadership (YWL) project. The project conducted participatory action-oriented research on young female students’ reproduction health rights utilising research teams spread across six university campuses in Southern Africa. The project aimed to strengthen young women’s capacity for research and leadership around questions of sexual health and reproductive rights.The YWL team at the University of Zimbabwe has a long history of engaging senior management to address issues pertaining to sexual harassment on campus. They lobbied for anti-sexual harassment policies at higher education facilities using the evidence-based research they developed. During the pandemic, the collective conducted a study which analysed transactional intergeneration sexual relationships between young women and older non-male students. Their work investigated the various manifestations of SGBV during the pandemic, particularly that affecting the female student population. Their research along with knowledge products created by other young feminists within the movement demonstrate that young feminists are experts on the issues. As young feminist leadership becomes a currency within development programmes and feminist movements, it’s important not to infantilise the third generation of activists. Alliance buildingAs articulated by Eerderwijk and Mugadza, the Zimbabwe women’s rights movement is built on coalitions between different women’s groups and activists. I’ve observed that the younger generation of activists encourage cross-agenda activism with strong collaborations between young women’s rights activists working on different issues within SRHR. Organisations that work on mental health issues will partner with organisations focusing on disability justice. Young feminists within established women’s rights organisation may advocate for partnerships with women activists or professionals that have unregistered entities to address the challenge of funding.There is an emphasis on wellness and collective care within these alliances in response to the patriarchal society they operate within especially given that the hierarchal systems are slow to appreciate or develop positive attitudes towards gender equality, gender expression and sexual orientation. ResourcesYoung women’s rights activists are often largely self-funded or receive donations to carry out their advocacy work. Those who are not part of women’s rights organisations, or any civil society organisation may not have the experience in proposal writing or do not have access to the network of organisations/funders that can refer them to funding. There are institutional barriers that exclude young women activists from accessing funding.For those with funding, the issue comes with the type of response modalities made available. Short-term programmatic funding isn’t enough. They require multi-year core funding that allows them to carry out their programmes, pay their staff/volunteers and have the autonomy to decide how they want to carry out their SHRH work.New trends within philanthropy are emerging as funders are consulting young feminist activists, particularly those within the digital advocacy space, to carry out campaigns. Tinastwe Mhaka expressed that she feels accepted within the mainstream women’s movement and continues to do sponsored work on reproductive justice. However, she expresses concern that with internet penetration rate of only around a third in Zimbabwe, “those who need critical access to information on reproductive justice, sexual education and freedom to gender expression might not access it”. Her concern raises the question, “How do we sustain grass roots organisations that do not engage in digital activism”? As more actors within the SRHR funding ecosystem create special funds for young feminist activists, they need to radically shift their funding modality to the realities of this generation. It’s important to understand that some entities do not have multiple references nor are they registered. These grass roots organisations may lack safeguarding measures and safety cyber security policies. They may appear “risky” but the work they do is critical to achieving a gender just society in this lifetime. The rhetoric on youth inclusion in policy making and governance is in abundance. However, the space is often limited to activists within formal women’s rights institutions. There are still barriers to entry as some dialogue spaces are held in big cities. Failure to open these conversations to an array of feminist activists and collectives existing outside the mainstream will create echo-chambers risking missing out the diverse perspectives and varied feminisms which exist within the young feminist movement. Tokenism is a threat to meaningful youth engagement. It is crucial that duty bearers recognise young women as change makers rather than passive beneficiaries of services. Whilst Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted, the civic space continues to shrink due to repressive legislation limiting civil society organisations’ freedom of association. The operational context for third generation Zimbabwean feminists remains difficult. Despite these restrictions and funding challenges, the generation remains persistent to achieve a gender just Zimbabwe. Working towards a feminist future demands meaningful partnerships built on intersectional feminist politics. This requires that feminist collectives, organisations, and activists acknowledge the power dynamics within the movement.",0,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Epworth', 'Harare', 'Mugadza', 'Warren Park'], 'CHN': ['Beijing']}",professional_cultural_exchange,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing']

Zimbabwe and China are extending their cultural ties while focusing on digitalising Zimbabwe’s cultural and creative industry (CCI), a move that cements the two countries’ already excellent relations, Sports, Arts and Culture Minister, Kirsty Coventry has said.
Speaking yesterday at Celebration Centre in the Capital, during the Chinese New Year celebration, also known as the spring festival, Minister Coventry emphasised the need for the continued growth of Zim-Sino relations.
The vibrant ceremony featured martial arts displays, dancing, singing and other activities showcased by both the Chinese and Zimbabwean people.
Minister Coventry said Zimbabwe was appreciating the great work being done by the Chinese government in terms of investments and industrial growth.
“It is important and critical to also note and appreciate the efforts by the Chinese government and the Chinese business community who continue to support investment and industrial growth across Zimbabwe’s economy.
“We are experiencing multiple sector growth and success in the CCI because of the technology that China is bringing to Zimbabwe,” she said.
She said occasions like these would help locals better understand Chinese customs and culture.
“Celebration of the Chinese New Year provides our people with an opportunity to further enhance friendship and cooperation.
“It is through interactions such as these we are witnessing today, that we are able to deepen our understanding of each other’s cultures, traditions and values and in the process stir the development of our two nations.
“Today, we share the pride of the Chinese people in the celebration of their culture at a global scale. Even the United Nations has given recognition to this cultural event, the Chinese New Year,” she said.
War Veterans and Liberation Struggle Affairs Minister, Ambassador Chris Mutsvangwa said the United Nations now recognised the Chinese New Year on their calendar, which was a very positive thing.
“We do have other nations’ civilisation events being recognised by the United Nations so the Chinese New year is now a floaty holiday for the United Nations.
“This is a good thing as Chinese civilisation makes inroads by infusing itself with other global civilisations, creating one sense of humanity,” he said.
Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Zhou Ding weighed in describing education as a vital tool for personal growth and social development.
“Today, I am happy to bring you the Chinese martial arts, magic and instrumental performances,” he said.
“I hope these performances will open a small window for you to the magnificent world of Chinese art and culture.
“I wish you all to realise your dreams in the future and contribute to the peace and prosperity of Zimbabwe and the whole world. The future belongs to you.”
He also reaffirmed Chinese support to Zimbabwe’s educational sector.
“The Chinese government has so far donated to a number of schools and universities in Zimbabwe including Chinhoyi University of Technology, Zimbabwe-China Friendship School in Bindura, Lupane Primary School, Warren Park D Primary School in Harare, and of course, here the Hatcliffe China-Zimbabwe Friendship High School.”

Whitney Matiyanga, a.k.a Brity Yonly, a Zimbabwean based in China, is keen to put the country on the international market through music.
Speaking to The Herald, Matiyanga said her music is inspired by the African culture and appreciates the continent’s originality and uniqueness.
In the past, she worked with Afro Jazz bands like The Blacks and Fire Fox Band as a lead singer before going solo in 2015.
“I play and teach mbira and marimba instruments, which have become a trademark instrument giving an African melody to my music,” said Whitney.
In 2018, she represented Zimbabwe at the Bergen Afro Arts Festival (BAAF) in Norway where she performed and conducted some mbira workshops.
While in Norway, Whitney collaborated with a Germany violinist, Steffi Wissing, on a song titled Tinzwe Kuchema.
An activist for women’s issues, Whitney is launching a Music for Girls and Women (MUFOGWO) festival which aims at empowering girls in the arts industry.
She hopes to address challenges faced by women in breaking the glass ceiling in the male dominated entertainment industry.
“I was motivated to launch an annual music festival for female musicians with the aim of giving them a free platform to exhibit their talents and build their self-esteem,” said Whitney.
She advised artists to take their work seriously and bring out the uniqueness in them, rather than spend lots of time imitating others.
Whitney is currently performing at an International Circus in China and her audience comprises of people from across the world.
The single she released in August last year, Fame Without Money, tackles problems faced by artists which include piracy, meagre payments on gigs and lack of performing slots.

Zimbabwe,7305,zimbabwesituation.com,2016-12-15T06:40:49Z,SI64 review continuous: Chinamasa,"Statutory Instrument 64 of 2016, which placed blanket restrictions on importation of a wide variety of goods, remains temporary and will be reviewed from time to time to add or subtract more products, Finance and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa has said.SI64 was widely criticised mainly by cross border traders but applauded by the local manufacturing industry that was choking on the back of unrestricted flooding of cheap imports into the country when it became effective in June this year.
The local industry says the restrictions have helped some firms boost capacity utilisation, market share and allowed them to create new jobs.
Government did not, however, provide time lines on how long the law would remain in force, a move criticised by some against unending protection.
Minister Chinamasa said review of the instrument “was a continuous process”.
“As we go forward we will be removing some items and placing them back on the open general import licence and putting some on the (restrictions) list,” he said.
He said assessments will be made on improvements made by companies benefiting from the protection and their ability to stand on their own to face competition.
Government is rallying companies that have been shielded under SI64 to invest in new machinery and improve efficiencies and quality of their goods.
In the 2017 National Budget presented last week, Minister Chinamasa added school uniforms, luggage wear and wheat flour on to the list of goods whose importation now required licensing to protect local industries.
The import restrictions have helped the country save scarce foreign currency as banks are now prioritising financing of imports, blocking unrestricted importation of trinkets.
In the long term, it is hoped the limitations will help close the huge gap between imports and exports, which has seen the country perennially recording a trade deficit. — New Ziana.",0,,,{},trade_financial_sanction,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']
Zimbabwe,10413,zimbabwesituation.com,2019-04-21T10:00:53Z,Chinamasa ‘brushes off’ sanctions mantra,"BY OBEY MANAYITI
Zanu PF politburo member and former Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa said Zimbabwe must find ways to evade the sanctions and grow the economy to stop the current meltdown.
Zimbabwe is reeling in economic turmoil that has resulted in sharp increases in the prices of basic goods.
In an interview recently, Chinamasa said sanctions were a reality but people should not fold their hands and find ways around the sanctions.
“I am not giving it (sanctions) as an excuse for inaction; we must accept reality. Sanctions are there, but it doesn’t mean that we must fold our arms and do nothing,” Chinamasa said.
“To say that the sanctions are not there is false, it’s a lie.
“The sanctions are there, they are hurting, but it doesn’t mean that because there are sanctions we should fold our hands and do nothing.
“We must work within the limitations of the sanctions to overcome them, which will take time, but we also need to see what we can do within our own limits without having to talk about sanctions all the time,” he said.
Chinamasa acknowledged that the rising cost of living was affecting many people, but said the country’s capacity to develop was seriously affected.
He said Zimbabwe needed political unity and unity of purpose from all political players.
Chinamasa said the country had from 1980 recorded some successes especially within the social services sectors such as education and health infrastructure.
He said another major achievement was that the country took back its land although that created some problems for Zimbabwe, including inviting sanctions.
“The challenges which we are facing are largely emanating from resolution of the land question because the sanctions were imposed and as a result the economy which should have been growing much faster has not been able to do so because of the sanctions,” he said.
He added that Zimbabwe must stand proud for the journey that it walked for the past 39 years despite a myriad of challenges.
Chanamasa said because of sanctions, the country could not access capital from strong economies, a challenge other countries in the region do not have.
He, however, also expressed confidence that the government would overcome the economic challenges.",0,,,{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe']},trade_financial_sanction,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']
Zimbabwe,10809,herald.co.zw,2019-09-05T00:32:45Z,Zim sanctions must go: China,"Tawanda Mudimu Photographic Editor
China stands with Africa in calling for the “immediate and unconditional” removal of all illegal sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by Western countries, Beijing’s Ambassador to Harare Mr Guo Shaochun has said.
Sadc countries last month declared October 25 as Solidarity Day against illegal sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe and resolved to conduct various activities in their respective countries on that day to resoundingly call for the immediate removal of the sanctions.
Speaking at the Chinese Embassy in Harare yesterday during the handover of US$13 million to Zimbabwe to assist in Cyclone Idai recovery efforts, Ambassador Guo said the argument that the sanctions were targeted and did not affect ordinary people and the economy was false.
“Some countries claim that the so-called targeted sanctions did not have a major negative impact on Zimbabwean economy and its people’s livelihood. Such an argument is false as sanctions disrupt financial transactions between Zimbabwe and outside world and disable Zimbabwe from accessing lines of credit from international financial institutions, which is essentially needed for development of a country,” Ambassador Guo said.
“We support efforts of Zimbabwe to uphold its sovereignty, national security and developmental interests. We also support its efforts to fend off foreign interference into its domestic affairs.
“We do this because we understand how Zimbabwe feels about being interfered and sanctioned.”
Ambassador Guo took a swipe at some Western countries and organisations for sponsoring violence, citing the recent scenario in Hong Kong and illegal demonstrations in Harare as an example of Western interference.
“What happened in Hong Kong has gone far beyond the scope of freedom of assembly, procession and demonstration and these radical, violent activities that severely undermine Hong Kong’s rule of law and social order, gravely threaten the life and property of Hong Kong’s citizens.
“Though China and Zimbabwe are geographically apart, what happened in Hong Kong may not be unfamiliar to Zimbabweans especially when some members of the US Congress, once again, proposed the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which cannot, but remind people of the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001.
“It is an old trick for the US to use sanctions to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs in furthering its own interests. The practices of some countries towards Zimbabwe and Hong Kong have once again exposed their hypocrisy and double standards,” he said.
The US$13 million was released through the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund launched by President Xi Jinping in 2015 at the United Nations Development Summit to facilitate the China’s support for sustainable development in developing countries.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'HKG': ['Hong Kong']}",trade_financial_sanction,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Zimbabwe,9956,thestandard.co.zw,2018-10-14T00:00:00Z,Chinese deals with Zim: raw or fair for the economy?,"Given the recent developments in Zimbabwe and the African continent, it is worthy assessing how Chinese investments can affect the local economy going forward. Critical for Zimbabwe is how the country can turn its close Sino relationship into a mutually beneficial cooperation relationship, not an exploitative one. China surpassed the United States in 2009 to become Africa’s largest trading partner.
by Victor Bhoroma
The import and export value of China-Africa trade has grown from US$10 billion in 2000 to over US$170 billion in 2017. China’s exports to Africa reached $94,74 billion, while imports from Africa reached US$75,26 billion, thus generating a trade surplus of $19,48 billion in a single year.
China has extended more than $110 billion in commercial loans to African governments and state-owned entities (SOEs) between 2000 and 2017, at an average of about $6 billion a year. Chinese investment into Africa has grown by 40% every year from $1 billion in 2004 to over $68 billion as of 2016. A study by McKinsey in 2017 pointed out that there are over 10 000 Chinese firms operating on the African continent with a large portion of them engaged in manufacturing, retailing and mining. As a result, China has become the biggest creditor, investor and economic partner on the African continent at the expense of the United States and the European Union (EU).
This phenomenal growth comes with widespread criticism, especially in most African countries such as Zimbabwe, but the fact is that China now has jaw-dropping influence in African economics because of its financial muscle. Since the turn of the century, the Chinese have gradually grown to be Zimbabwe’s go-to friend on funding due to the country’s isolation from the Western nations and renowned financial institutions such as IMF and World Bank. Chinese engagements with Zimbabwe cut across trade, investments, infrastructure financing and military co-operation.
Trade between Zimbabwe and China has grown to over $1,2 billion annually with Zimbabwe exporting Tobacco, Cotton and various minerals. Imports from China mainly range from electrical goods, auto parts to various household merchandise. The most imposing Chinese investment in Zimbabwe has been the Long Chen Plaza built by Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Corporation (AFECC) for $200 million in 2013.
Since the opening of the giant mall in Harare, Chinese retailers have occupied strategic positions in almost every town in Zimbabwe making them a force to reckon with in retailing. Other notable projects include the Golden Peacock Villa Hotel in Mutare built by Anjin Investments and National Defence College in Mazowe. In agriculture, the Chinese market is the largest consumer of Zimbabwe’s flue cured tobacco with over $200 million worth of trade in the golden leaf in 2017. As a result, a number of Chinese firms are angling towards tobacco processing close to source in Harare.
In addition to providing capital for farmers, the out grower scheme has guaranteed a ready market for Zimbabwean tobacco and ensured viability of the sector which now employs thousands of farmers. In the energy sector, China’s Sino-hydro entered into a deal with the government in 2015 to expand the Kariba South power plant at a cost of US$533 million and the project was commissioned early this year. The expansion added 300MW to the national grid, thereby partially reducing the national power deficit. In June this year, China’s Import and Export Bank started releasing funds for the $1,4 billion expansion of Hwange Power Station by the same contractor. According to Zesa, the project is expected to take 42 months and add 600MW to the national grid.
Further, the China Africa Sunlight Energy has expressed interest in the 600MW coal-fired power plant in Gwayi. Other projects of note include the three agreements signed between Zesa and CHINT Electrical of China to construct Solar Plants with a generating capacity of 300MW in partnership with Intratrek Zimbabwe. Whether these projects materialise or not, time will tell. However, their implementation has potential to wipe out the country’s power deficit and place Zimbabwe back on the energy self-sufficiency map. In transport and communication infrastructure, the Chinese funded the expansion of the Victoria Falls Airport in 2016 to the tune of $150 million, with China Jiangsu International Group being the contractor. In July this year, Zimbabwe signed another deal valued at $153 million for the expansion of Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport with the same financiers and contractor. This project is expected to run parallel to the dualisation of the Beitbridge-Harare-Chirundu highway funded to the tune of over $2 billion by AFECC. State-owned entities such as NetOne and TelOne have also received loans from China valued over $400 million which have been integral in telecommunications network expansion locally, thereby improving internet connectivity.
The completed projects funded by the Chinese have demonstrated that the Zimbabwean economy can benefit from Chinese deals as long as commercial contracts incorporate sufficient due diligence by Parliament to ensure transparency. It is also key to channel loans where they are necessary and have monitoring systems in place to ensure the projects meet international standards. Angles that need tightening of screws include border control for anti-smuggling of minerals and externalisation of sales proceeds to China though informal means. Additionally tax collection systems through the tax agency need to be watertight to ensure compliance with local regulations.
As with various recipients of Chinese loans and investments in Africa, reports of unfair labour practices, corruption, product dumping and counterfeiting, natural resource exploitation, tax evasion, externalisation of foreign currency and fabrication of work permits for Chinese nationals have been reported in the local media. In 2014, Anjin Investments and Jinan were caught in a storm over allegations of Diamonds smuggling worth billions of dollars from Chiadzwa. In May this year, the Office of the President and Cabinet released a damning report of funds externalised illegally. Chinese nationals and companies featured prominently on the list with millions of dollars salted away from the local economy through various means.
Despite negative perceptions that economic ties between the two countries disproportionately benefit China and the general view among Zimbabweans that Chinese workmanship is shoddy, Chinese Investments can be used to grow the local economy and create employment as demonstrated in tobacco farming where Zimbabwe eclipsed the 237,1 million kg record output this year with the Chinese as key partners. Chinese multinational corporations such as Huawei, Yutong, BAIC, Lenovo, ZTE, CHINT Electrical and Hisense can partner local firms and bring technological development to local suppliers or customers. However, without a clear strategy, Chinese investments may bring negative implications of geopolitical influence and unwarranted foreign debt to Zimbabwe as it has done in other parts of Africa such as Zambia, Djibouti and Kenya.

BY VENERANDA LANGA
SI20 became effective on February 1, raising prices of all meat products, and in the process causing a public outcry among consumers and livestock producers.
“Following our debate and stakeholders’ representation, where concerns have been raised regarding SI20, I am proposing to shelve implementation of SI20, which levies VAT on the listed products,” Chinamasa said.
“This will allow for further consultation with relevant stakeholders, and these consultations begin with Parliament because I need input from the House.”
The Finance minister, however, said he had to get something to tax in order to get revenue to pay salaries and finance other activities, but MPs could be heard interjecting, saying he needed to cut down on the Executive’s foreign travels.
Chinamasa told the House that he charged the 15% VAT on the products on the basis of Sadc protocols that Zimbabwe ratified, where member States are supposed to harmonise tax regimes.
“Sadc created a list of zero-rated and exempt products, saying they must be streamlined to broaden the tax base, enhance revenue collection, minimise corruption, and ensure similarity, equitability and fairness in member States,” he said.
Chinamasa said Zimbabwe had one of the longest lists of zero-rated products such as maize, mealie meal, wheat, bread, cooking oil, fruits, salt and others, while countries like Zambia, Lesotho and Namibia minimised their lists of zero-rated products to items such as rice, vegetables and eggs.
MPs described Chinamasa as one of the “sane” and reasonable ministers in President Robert Mugabe’s government.
“He is so good, he is the only minister who does not have Zanu PF DNA. The steps taken by Chinamasa are good because the goods were basic necessities for Zimbabweans and the impact of taxing them is huge in terms of the cost of living,” Binga North MP, Prince Dubeko Sibanda said.
Meanwhile, MPs blasted corrupt tendencies in State procurement procedures, saying the Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets Bill, which went through the Committee stage in the National Assembly, must address regional and gender discrimination in the award of tenders, as well as corruption.
MDC legislator Priscilla Misihairabwi-Mushonga said there was so much discriminàtion that tenders were confined to Harare only and regions like Matabeleland and women never got tenders.
“Are you saying all people from Matabeleland are so daft that they cannot get into economic issues?” she said.
Dangamvura-Chikanga MP, Esau Mupfumi said she was being tribalistic, but Speaker of the National Assembly Jacob Mudenda discarded the point of order, saying there was nothing tribalistic about raising issues of marginalisation of certain provinces, adding there were Shona people in Bulawayo just as there were Ndebeles in Harare.",0,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare', 'Bulawayo', 'Matabeleland North Province'], 'ZMB': ['Republic of Zambia'], 'LSO': ['Kingdom of Lesotho'], 'NAM': ['Republic of Namibia']}",trade_financial_sanction,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']
Zimbabwe,1445,herald.co.zw,2013-11-05T03:40:28Z,Cash for raided forex holders,"Zvamaida Murwira Senior Reporter—–
THE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has undertaken to repay, with interest, all corporates and individuals who lost money in their Foreign Currency Accounts that were raided by the central bank as part of sanctions-busting measures at the height of the hyperinflationary period.
The central bank said while it had no definite period within which the payments would be made, everyone who lost money would get it back.
This emerged during an appeal by the bank in the Supreme Court yesterday against a High Court ruling that the bank pay Trojan Mine US$1 million it took from its account held by BancABC.
RBZ lawyer Advocate Linos Mazonde told the Supreme Court that the directive to financial institutions to surrender all money held in forex accounts was done in terms of the law.
“The RBZ will pay back the money at 12 percent per annum,” he said.
“It might be in days, months, but the money will be returned to the banks and not to individuals. At the time of the directive, depositors still needed authority from the central bank to withdraw the money.”
Adv Mazonde was responding to a question by Justice Elizabeth Gwaunza on when the repayments would be done.
Although the actual figure the RBZ owes to corporates and individuals is not known, it is saddled with debts of more than US$1 billion and has admitted to raiding private bank accounts to help fund Government’s operations as the country battled debilitating sanctions.
Other judges who heard the case were Justice Bharat Patel and Justice Ann Mary Gowora.
Last month, the Supreme Court ordered Standard Chartered Bank to pay back money it transferred to RBZ which belonged to Chinese firm, China Shougang International.
The appropriation of the funds followed a monetary policy statement issued by the RBZ in October 2007 centralising all foreign currency accounts.
In yesterday’s court hearing, the central bank argued that it should not be litigated, citing the immunity that was extended to it in terms of the RBZ Act. Adv Mazonde said the central bank was not negligent when it used the money.
Lawyer for Trojan Mine, Advocate Lewis Uriri submitted that the RBZ should not be allowed to get away with the excuse of immunity because that was never an issue during the High Court hearing which ordered it to repay the money.
He said it was not permissible for a party to raise issues that were not raised during the first hearing when the matter was at the appeal hearing stage as what the central bank sought to do by raising immunity.
Adv Uriri said even if it was to be accepted that the RBZ enjoyed immunity, that would not save it because there was no good faith when it made the directive and it acted negligently by expropriating depositors’ money.
He said while the bank was empowered to direct banks to transfer foreign currency, it was not entitled to use it as what it eventually did.
“There is nothing in the monetary policy statement that authorised the RBZ to use the money,” he said.
“It just said money should be brought to a central point. That did not suggest that depositors would lose their money. That is why we are saying certain jurisdictional facts should exist for it to enjoy the immunity.”
Adv Uriri said there was wrongful breach of contract by the central bank, a view that formed the basis upon which the High Court dismissed its case.
“The question of immunity cannot, therefore, succeed,” he said.
“Once there is a finding of wrongfulness and absence of good faith, resort cannot then be made to immunity.”
Justice Patel asked how a judgment against the central bank would be enforced in light of the fact that there was a law which said its property could not be attached.
Adv Uriri said what was important was to secure a judgment ordering the RBZ to reimburse the money and issues of how to enforce that judgment could be pursued later.
Justice Gwaunza said the court would reserve judgment in the matter.",0,,,{},trade_financial_sanction,['Shougang'],['Shougang'],['Shougang'],['Shougang']

by Elias Mambo
Sources in the blanket manufacturing industry said the Chinese nationals were importing woven blankets through the porous Forbes Border Post in Mutare, which are being fraudulently declared as woven long pile fabric which attracts duty of only 10%.
“The Chinese are importing blankets via the Beira route and they have been told by Zimra officials to declare their containers using a wrong tariff,” the source said.
“Containers are being shipped into the country from Mozambique and at the border, they are using Code 58, which is meant for woven long pile fabric, which attracts 10% duty,” the source said.
“Blankets attract duty of 40% and an additional $2,50 per kilogramme.”
Government recently declared that blankets, second-hand clothing and shoes were now regulated under Statutory Instrument 19 of 2016, which prohibits the importation of such products without an import licence.
However, sources said despite the government prohibition, those importing blankets were declaring them as woven fabric.
“The blankets come in without bordering seams, which are then cut into regular sizes locally. A container carries 17 000kg of blankets, which should attract duty of close to $62 900 if properly declared,” the sources said.
“If such a container is declared using the tariff Code 58, then it will only pay $12 000 as import duty, prejudicing the country of $50 000 per container.
“It is a scandal which involves very senior Zimra officials because the containers are not inspected at the port of entry.
“The scheme has crippled local manufacturers such as Waverley Blankets and National Blankets.”
A source at Waverley Blankets said the company, which employees close to 750 people, was being forced out of business and officials now contemplating downsizing.
“Around 750 people are employed by Waverley Blankets, but of late, there have been threats of downsizing and at times, salaries are delayed because the company is no longer producing at maximum capacity because of competition with the Chinese blankets,” the Waverley Blankets official, who declined to be named, said.
At the time of going to print last night, Zimra had not yet responded to questions emailed to its public relations department.

Zimbabwe,11203,zimbabwesituation.com,2020-01-13T06:32:17Z,Sanctions not justified: China,"Farirai Machivenyika Senior Reporter
Sanctions that were imposed on Zimbabwe by Western countries have no justification in international law and impede the country’s development, Chinese Foreign Affairs Minister and State Councillor Mr Wang Yi has said.
He said China was confident Zimbabwe would successfully solve its economic challenges.
Mr Wang, who arrived here on Saturday night, stressed at a Press conference yesterday after a meeting with Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Sibusiso Moyo: “The unilateral sanctions imposed by some countries and organisations on Zimbabwe have no basis in international law and they violate the legitimate development rights of Zimbabwe. China fully supports the just aspirations of Zimbabwe and African countries to quickly remove those sanctions on Zimbabwe.”
Mr Wang is in Zimbabwe on the last leg of his five-nation tour that has seen him visit Egypt, Djibouti, Eritrea and Burundi.
Minister Moyo described the meeting with his Chinese counterpart as having been successful.
“We discussed a number of issues ranging from our own political, economic, social, cultural and other matters which are well embedded in our mutual interest and I can tell you that the meeting was very successful and we are looking forward to getting to greater heights between Zimbabwe and China,” he said.
Mr Wang’s call against the illegal sanctions dovetails with a resolution by Sadc and endorsed by the African Union that the embargo has negatively affected the economy and brought untold suffering to ordinary people.
Sadc Heads of State also took up the matter during last year’s United Nations General Assembly, lobbying the international community to call for the removal of the two-decades long sanctions regime.
Mr Wang said Zimbabwe had the capacity to come out of the economic challenges it was facing.
“Our two sides need to uphold the win-win cooperation in infrastructure, agriculture and mining and meanwhile explore new areas of growth in our cooperation. The Chinese side understands the difficulties and bottlenecks faced by Zimbabwe, but we trust that
Zimbabwe has the wisdom and capabilities to address these challenges and, as Zimbabwe’s good friend, we are also prepared to provide policy consultations and experiences we had based on Zimbabwe’s will,” he said.
Speaking on the role of China and Zimbabwe he said: “Our countries have a big role to play by working together, in a world full of uncertainty. Both China and Zimbabwe stand on the right side of history, on the side of equity and justice and on the side of developing countries.
“Both countries believe in the equality of nations irrespective of their size and reject the bullying of the weak. Both of us believe in win-win situations for our countries and reject zero-sum game. Both of us believe in multilateralism and the basic norms upholding international relations and reject unilateralism and bullying practices,” he said.
Mr Wang said he and Minister Moyo discussed issues related to relations between the two countries.
“In recent years, thanks to the joint support and guidance of President XI Jinping and President Mnangagwa, China-Zimbabwe relations have made fruitful results and create important opportunities,” he said.
“I am here with the primary goal to further implement the important agreement between the two Presidents and the outcomes of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and to further deepen the comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation between China and Zimbabwe. We had a productive meeting with Minister Moyo here and we reached so many important agreements.
“Over the past four decades, China-Zimbabwe relations have stood big tests and stormy weathers and both sides have stood firmly by this friendship. The most fundamental aspect of that friendship is the mutual respect and support we have given each other all along. China supports Zimbabwe’s resolve to uphold national dignity and we support Zimbabwe’s efforts to independently explore a development path suited to its national conditions. We also appreciate Zimbabwe giving priority to China-Zimbabwe relations in its diplomacy and we also thank Zimbabwe for the invaluable support it has given China on our core interests. We are prepared to always be good friends and good partners with Zimbabwe.”
In his opening address before the closed-door meeting, Minister Moyo thanked China for the assistance it has rendered to the country.
“Zimbabwe greatly appreciates the support that it has received from China in implementing projects that are key in its development and will contribute to the attainment of middle income economy status by 2030.
“Several projects such as Victoria Falls Airport, Kariba Expansion have already been completed and tangible results are being seen. Not only has China extended support through project implementation, but has also provided humanitarian assistance following cyclone Idai and El Nino-induced drought,” Minister Moyo said.
Yesterday’s meeting was also attended by Finance and Economic Development Minister Mthuli Ncube, Local Government and Public Works Minister July Moyo, Industry and Commerce Minister Dr Sekai Nzenza, Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement Minister Perrance Shiri and Environment, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Victoria Falls Airport'], 'EGY': ['Arab Republic of Egypt'], 'DJI': ['Republic of Djibouti'], 'ARE': ['Irtīriyā']}",trade_financial_sanction,['China'],"['Wang Yi', 'China']","['China', 'Wang Yi']","['Wang Yi', 'China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,5373,theindependent.co.zw,2015-12-04T05:08:17Z,Rand drops on spectre of US interest rate hike,"SOUTH Africa’s rand fell in early trade yesterday as the US dollar gained after United States Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said she was “looking forward” to the first US interest rate increase in nearly a decade.
Financial matters by IH
Stocks opened lower, with telecoms company MTN Group in the spotlight. Nigerian authorities reduced by more than a third, to US$3,4 billion, a fine imposed on MTN for failing to cut off unregistered users.
MTN was up nearly 1% at 147,90 rand, outpacing a 0,4 decline to 45,777 in the JSE Top-40 index.
The rand was trading at 14,3700 in morning trade, down 0,13% from Wednesday’s close. The rand fell to an all-time low of 14,4950 to the US dollar on Tuesday.
A US rate increased is widely expected hike when the Fed meets later this month. When she spoke at the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday, Yellen did not say whether an increase would be warranted at that meeting, but she did say keeping rates at zero for too long could threaten financial stability.
Yellen was scheduled to speak again yesterday and traders expect the rand to remain under pressure.
“Given that she will most likely maintain her more hawkish rhetoric, we expect the rand to remain vulnerable to intensified Fed rate hike expectations,” Barclays Africa currency strategist Mike Keenan said.
Her comments sent the US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, to its highest level since April 2003. The rand remained resilient, on the strength of loan agreements between China and South Africa, but then gave up some gains in early trade.
China signed 26 agreements pledging to invest US$6,5bn to support South Africa’s flagging economy and its own exports to the nation, as Chinese President Xi Jinping met with counterpart Jacob Zuma ahead of a summit this week with leaders from across the continent.
The deals include a US$2,5bn credit line provided by China Export & Credit Insurance to South African rail and transport operator Transnet for electrical and mechanical equipment, and a US$500-million China Development Bank loan-finance accord that will help electricity utility Eskom to complete its power plant construction plan.
South Africa suffers from a chronic electricity shortage that is increasing costs for industry and discouraging investment. Part of its response is to build new nuclear plants, which experts say may cost as much as US$100bn.
On the fixed-income market, government bonds were mostly firmer, with the yield for debt due in 2026 shedding 1,5 basis points at 8,6%.
The agreements were signed on Wednesday in Pretoria. Xi arrived earlier in the day from neighbouring Zimbabwe, where he had held talks with President Robert Mugabe and signed aid deals for projects ranging from power to infrastructure.
“Our two countries complement each other strongly economically,” Xi told reporters after the signing ceremony.
“Our co-operation on international affairs is becoming ever closer. China-South Africa relations are in the best shape ever.”
Xi is on a five-day African visit that includes the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation with leaders from across the continent in Johannesburg today and tomorrow. Chinese commerce with Africa reached US$220bn last year, making it the continent’s biggest trade partner. One of the agreements is aimed at synchronising discrepancies in trade statistics.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said last month that the country’s investment in Africa fell by more than 40% in the first half of 2015.
Beijing Automotive Group will invest as much as R11bn in what could become the biggest car plant in South Africa, Geoffrey Qhena, the chief executive officer of South Africa’s Industrial Development Corporation, said in an interview. Production may start at the end of 2017, with some of the cars probably being exported to other parts of Africa, he said.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa', 'Pretoria', 'Johannesburg'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Washington'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe']}",trade_financial_sanction,['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping']

Mahwe told the two, who are out on bail, that their trials would commence on June 11, 2015 after the State requested 14 days to secure a Chinese interpreter to facilitate trial.
The duo is charged in terms of contravening Section 5 (1) (a)(i) and (ii) of the Exchange Control Act.
The sections reads: “Subject to subsection (2), a person who, either within or outside Zimbabwe contravenes or fails to comply with any provision of this Act other than section eight; or the terms or conditions of any permit, authority, permission, direction, notice, order or other instrument made or issued under or by virtue of this Act.”
The State alleges that Zhang on several occasions last year transferred or externalised a total of $105 000 from Zimbabwe without approval from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.
Juan is also alleged to have siphoned out $85 000 in contravention of the Exchange Control Act.

Zimbabwe,10570,herald.co.zw,2019-06-06T00:01:46Z,"China-US trade friction: Dialogue, cooperation is the only solution","Ambassador Guo Shaochun Special Correspondent
Whenever I read the regular press briefing by the Chinese Foreign Ministry these days, I find the most frequently asked questions are about the trade war between China and the US. The Chinese and international media all come to focus on this issue and it also has become an important topic for discussion on various occasions.
The State Council Information Office of the Chinese Government released a white paper, on June 2, titled “China’s Position on the China-US Economic and Trade Consultations”. It is the right document to read for us to gain a comprehensive understanding about this issue.
Why has the United States waged a trade war against China?
Since the new US administration took office in 2017, it has trumpeted “America First” , adopted a series of unilateral and protectionist measures and regularly wielded tariffs as a “big stick” and coerced other countries into accepting its demands, causing disruption to the global economic and trade landscape. Specifically targeting China, in August 2017 it launched a unilateral investigation under Section 301. Turning a blind eye to China’s unremitting efforts and remarkable progress in protecting intellectual property and improving the business environment for foreign investors, the US issued a myriad of slanted and negative observations, and imposed additional tariffs and investment restrictions on China, provoking economic and trade friction between the two countries.
The Strategies and tactics of the United States in waging a Trade War against China
Maximum pressuring and backtracking
Looking at previous media coverage on the past 11 rounds of trade talks, it’s easy to see clearly which side has been flip-flopping all along. In May last year, China and the US reached consensus on trade and issued a joint statement in Washington, DC. But just a few days after that, the US abandoned the agreement. In December last year, the two sides reached consensus on the value of China’s purchases from the US, but in the following talks the US wantonly rejected the agreement and asked for more. It is never China that backtracks and breaks commitments; it is the US that provoked the trade disputes, not China; it is the US that fired the first shot in raising tariffs, not China; it is the US that repeatedly resorted to maximum pressuring, not China.
Intending to intervene China’s sovereign affairs
From late March to early April 2019, the working teams of the two countries held another three rounds of high-level consultations and made substantial progress. Following numerous rounds of consultations, the two countries had agreed on most of the issues. Regarding the remaining issues, the Chinese government required mutual understanding and compromise for solutions to be found.
But the more the US government is offered, the more it wants. Resorting to intimidation and coercion, it persisted with exorbitant demands, maintained the additional tariffs imposed since the friction began, and insisted on including mandatory requirements concerning China’s sovereign affairs in the deal, which only served to delay the resolution of remaining differences. On May 6, 2019, the US irresponsibly accused China of backtracking on its position to shift the blame for the inconclusive talks onto China. Despite China’s fierce opposition, the US raised the additional tariffs on US$200 billion of Chinese exports to the US from 10 percent to 25 percent, which represented a serious setback to the economic and trade consultations. On May 13 the US announced that it had launched procedures to slap additional tariffs on remaining Chinese goods, which are worth around US$300 billion.
Launching a technology war against China
With the resumption of the Sino-US trade war, the United States found it difficult to bring the Chinese economy to its knees by imposing tariffs, so it set its sights on China’s enterprises. On May 15, the Bureau of Industry and Security of the US Department of Commerce announced that Huawei Technology Co. Ltd. had been put on a “blacklist” and banned the sale or transfer of US technology to Huawei.
To cooperate with the technology war, for some time certain US politicians have been fabricating rumours on Huawei without providing any convincing evidence as required by other countries. There have been growing criticism at home in the US over the market fluctuations and disruptions to industrial cooperation caused by the trade war and science and technology war initiated by the US.
Under such circumstances, those US politicians, who have been trying to mislead the public by wilful lies, are even attempting to incite an ideological conflict. According to some German media, after years of review, the UK, Germany and the EU failed to find any back-door in Huawei products. Security loopholes, however, have often been detected in US company Cisco’s equipment, with 10 back-door cases revealed since 2013. Since the PRISM incident, the US has always kept silent on evidence-based accusations of its cyber attacks and cyber theft.
The cases of the PRISM program and Alstom vividly tell the world that even similar ideologies do not prevent the US from taking unjustifiable measures against its allies. Presuming other’s behaviour by one’s own pattern, the US has been smearing foreign companies in an attempt to gain an unfair competitive advantage. But it has failed to produce any solid evidence. The findings of the European side have proven Huawei’s innocence and exposed the lack of legitimacy of the US suppression of foreign businesses with state power.
China’s reaction and position
In response to the economic and trade friction unilaterally initiated by the US since March 2018, China has had to take forceful measures to defend the interests of the nation and its people. At the same time, committed to resolving disputes through dialogue and consultation, China has engaged in multiple rounds of economic and trade consultations with the US in an effort to stabilise the bilateral commercial relationship.
China’s position has been consistent and clear — that cooperation serves the interests of the two countries, that conflict can only hurt both, and that cooperation is the only correct choice for both sides. Concerning their differences and frictions on the economic and trade front, China is willing to work together with the US to find solutions, and to reach a mutually beneficial and win-win agreement.
However, cooperation has to be based on principles. There are bottom lines in consultations. China will not compromise on major issues of principle. China does not want a trade war, but it is not afraid of one and it will fight one if necessary. China’s position on this has never changed. However, some people in the US seemed to have misjudged the current situation and underestimated China’s determination and will to defend its rights and interests. They were still muddying the waters and making impossible demands. It was only natural for China to oppose and resist that.
The economic and trade relations between China and the US, the two biggest economies in the world, are of great significance to the two countries and the global economy. The US should have worked with China and shouldered its responsibilities for global growth. But on the contrary, it insisted on staging a trade war unilaterally and repeatedly increased tariffs on Chinese goods against standing consensus while China has kept full sincerity for the consultations. The international community has its fair judgment on who is the initiator of the latest round of a tariff war, the rule-breaker in free trade and the generator of risks in global economy.
China is an innovative and diligent nation. It has created a highly-sophisticated civilisation and contributed significantly to human progress over the course of 5 000 years. Since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949, and in particular since the beginning of reform and opening up in 1978, China’s scientific and technological undertakings have passed through a series of phases. They started from a difficult beginning, forged ahead in the course of reform, and have now achieved multiple breakthroughs featuring a variety of innovations.
These achievements have won worldwide recognition. Historical records confirm that China’s achievements in scientific and technological innovation are not something we stole or forcibly took from others; they were earned through self-reliance and hard work. In 2017, total R&D investment in China reached RMB1,76 trillion, ranking second in the world. The number of patent applications reached 1,382 million, ranking No. 1 in the world for the seventh consecutive year.
The number of invention patents granted reached 327 000, up by 8,2 percent year-on-year. China ranks third in the world in terms of valid invention patents held. China has always pursued international technical cooperation with mutual benefit and win-win as the basic value orientation. China’s economic development has benefited from international technology transfer and dissemination. International holders of technology have also reaped enormous benefits from this process. China encourages and respects voluntary technical cooperation between Chinese and foreign firms based on market principles.
It strongly opposes forced technology transfer and takes resolute action against intellectual property infringement. Accusing China of stealing intellectual property to support its own development is an unfounded fabrication. Accusations against China of forced technology transfer are baseless and untenable.
Trade protectionist measures of the US side will have some impact on our economy, but we can totally overcome it. China has the confidence and capability to guard against any external risks and impacts. In the first quarter this year, China’s GDP grew by 6,4 percent year on year, which is more than expected. In particular, domestic demand has become the main driver for growth.
Last year, consumption contributed 76,2 percent of our economic growth. In its recent World Economic Outlook report, the IMF downgraded its outlook for global economic growth to 3,3 percent while upgrading China’s growth to 6,3 percent from 6,2 percent. China was the only country that got upgraded in the forecast among all major economies. With trade partners all around the world, China is turning more rapidly into a strong trading nation. Many countries would like to share China’s development dividends. If some country does not want to do business with China, others will soon fill in the vacancy.
In China, over the past four decades of reform and opening up, enormous achievements have been made in economic and social development. As foreign investment environment keeps improving, China has become one of the most popular destinations for global investment for many consecutive years. According to the World Bank’s Doing Business 2019 report, China has moved up over 30 places in the ease of doing business rankings.
According to the 2019 Business Climate Survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, around 80 percent surveyed business representatives said the investment environment in China has improved or stayed the same; 62 percent of them ranked China as the first or top-three investment destination worldwide. Latest statistics from relevant Chinese authorities show that the number of foreign companies newly set up in China in 2018 topped 60 000, up by 69,8 percent.
China has a well-developed industrial system, growing capability for scientific and technological innovation, the largest middle-income population and a huge market for domestic consumption and investment. With every confidence in our economy, following our own timetable and roadmap, we will continue to advance the reform and opening up and pursue high-quality growth for steady and sustained progress.
Foreign enterprises are welcome to increase their investment in China and we will continue to foster an investment and business environment that is more stable, fair, transparent and predictable for them. At the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, President Xi Jinping announced that China will take a series of major steps to promote higher-standard reform and opening up. We will expand market access for foreign investment, increase the import of goods and services and implement in real earnest opening-up policies. This will surely provide new opportunities for enterprises worldwide to invest and operate in China, and contribute to the free trading system and growth in global trade.
The pressing task at the moment, which is also our hope, is that the US will work with China to meet each other halfway and strive for a mutually-beneficial agreement on the basis of mutual respect. It serves the interests of both China and the US and is the common aspiration of the international community. As we believe, it takes sincerity to make a consultation meaningful. Judging from what the US did in previous talks, there are two things that must be made clear. First, the consultation needs to follow the principle of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. Second, words must be matched with deeds.
The bullying practice towards Zimbabwe
The trade war is one form of American hegemonic act and power politics against China and some other countries and here in this country the hegemony is reflected in the around 20 years of US sanctions against Zimbabwe. The sanctions, though, are claimed to be just against 141 individuals and entities, have undermined the environment for Zimbabwe’s economic development, for instances, obstructing the country’s application for necessary loans from international financiers, promotion of foreign direct investment and the transfer of foreign currency, leading to economic decay, shortage of medicines, even loss of lives of innocent people.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa has been bravely enduring the pressure and recently said “the Zimbabwean economy was greatly affected by the sanctions imposed by Western countries. Under the new dispensation, we have said, with or without sanctions, we must focus on developing our economy.”
China will never bow to the pressure from any big power. No one can force its plan on China. No challenge can hold back China’s development. Looking forward, China is committed to credible consultations based on equality and mutual benefit. China will continue to get support from all the friendly countries including Zimbabwe in this just cause against hegemony and power politics. The principle of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit will prevail.
Cooperation will benefit both China and the US while confrontation serves the interest of neither. In a world of inter-connected development, we are all in the same boat and need to strive for win-win results.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Wyndham Washington, DC'], 'GBR': ['United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'], 'DEU': ['Federal Republic of Germany'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe']}",trade_financial_sanction,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,10592,theindependent.co.zw,2019-06-06T19:15:39Z,US-China war to impact global trade,"THE on-going trade war between the United States and China will not stop the development of the Asian nation, although tensions have affected not just bilateral trade between the two countries, but also world trade, the Deputy Head and Political Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe Zhao Baogang says.
By Lisa Tazviinga
Zhao’s comments come in the wake of Beijing releasing a hard-hitting White Paper accusing US of adopting bullying tactics while warning that it was not afraid of a trade war and would not compromise on matters of principle.
“The development of China is like galloping Zambezi river,” Zhao told the Zimbabwe Independent in an interview.
“Though facing ups and downs and twists and turns, it will flow through and reach its destination — the Ocean. China will achieve its objectives of development and national rejuvenation finally. No challenge will hold back China’s development.”
China and US have for several months held talks aimed at reaching a trade deal, but the latest round of trade talks failed, with Beijing accusing the Donald Trump administration of frequently backtracking on its commitments and making new demands, including mandatory requirements concerning China’s sovereign affairs in the trade deal.
The US has raised its duties from 10% to 25% on US$200 billion of Chinese exports into the US, and in retaliation China increased tariffs on US$110 billion of US goods.
“The US escalated the stakes in May by putting the Chinese telecom giant Huawei on a blacklist that bars US companies from supplying it with computer chips, software and other components without government approval. China then announced last Friday that it would set up the unreliable entities list, a mechanism targeting foreign enterprises, organisations and individuals that don’t obey market rules, violate contracts and block, cut off supply for non-commercial reasons or severely damage the legitimate interests of Chinese companies,” Zhao said.
The escalating tension between the two economic powerhouses will see global trade slowing by 2,6% in 2019, according to the World Trade Organisation.
China this week released a white paper stating it prefers dialogue with the US but would not compromise its position.
China said threats of a trade war and continuous tariff hikes would not resolve trade and economic issues adding only consultations which are “guided by a spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit” would do so.
“Every country has its own matters of principle. During consultations, a country’s sovereignty and dignity must be respected, and any agreement reached by the two sides must be based on equality and mutual benefit. On major issues of principle, China will not back down,” Beijing said.
“. . . The recent US move to increase tariffs on Chinese exports does not help to solve bilateral trade issues.
China strongly opposes this and has to respond to safeguard its lawful rights and interests. China has been consistent and clear on its position, that it hopes to resolve issues through dialogue rather than tariff measures.
“China will act rationally in the interests of the Chinese people, the American people, and all other peoples around the world. However, China will not bow under pressure and will rise to any challenge coming its way. China is open to negotiation, but will also fight to the end if needed.”
Beijing said its development would not be halted by the trade war despite difficulties.
“China’s development may not be all smooth sailing. Difficulties or even perils are inevitable. Whatever the future might bring, China is confident of meeting challenges head on, turning risks into opportunities, and opening new chapters,” the White paper reads.
“China remains committed to its own cause no matter how the external environment changes. The fundamental solution to economic and trade tensions is to grow stronger through reform and opening up.”
Beijing said the trade was affecting both China and US, while also affecting global trade. “The uncertainty brought by US-China economic and trade friction made companies in both countries more hesitant about investing. China’s investment in the US continues to fall and the growth rate of US investment in China has also slowed down.
According to Chinese statistics, direct investment by Chinese companies in the US was US$5,79 billion in 2018, down by 10% year-on-year. In 2018, paid-in US investment in China was US$2,69 billion, up by only 1,5% year-on-year compared with an increase of 11% in 2017.”",1,,,"{'USA': ['United States'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'A Zambezi River Lodge']}",trade_financial_sanction,"['China', 'Huawei', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Huawei']","['China', 'Huawei', 'Beijing']","['Huawei', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Zimbabwe,7524,newsday.co.zw,2017-02-08T00:00:00Z,"Chinamasa shelves VAT on meat, cereals","FINANCE minister Patrick Chinamasa yesterday shelved implementation of Statutory Instrument 20 (SI20), which imposed 15% VAT on rice, meat, potatoes, margarine, cereals and mahewu, telling MPs in a ministerial statement that he first had to consult before introducing the levy.
BY VENERANDA LANGA
SI20 became effective on February 1, raising prices of all meat products, and in the process causing a public outcry among consumers and livestock producers.
“Following our debate and stakeholders’ representation, where concerns have been raised regarding SI20, I am proposing to shelve implementation of SI20, which levies VAT on the listed products,” Chinamasa said.
“This will allow for further consultation with relevant stakeholders, and these consultations begin with Parliament because I need input from the House.”
The Finance minister, however, said he had to get something to tax in order to get revenue to pay salaries and finance other activities, but MPs could be heard interjecting, saying he needed to cut down on the Executive’s foreign travels.
Chinamasa told the House that he charged the 15% VAT on the products on the basis of Sadc protocols that Zimbabwe ratified, where member States are supposed to harmonise tax regimes.
“Sadc created a list of zero-rated and exempt products, saying they must be streamlined to broaden the tax base, enhance revenue collection, minimise corruption, and ensure similarity, equitability and fairness in member States,” he said.
Chinamasa said Zimbabwe had one of the longest lists of zero-rated products such as maize, mealie meal, wheat, bread, cooking oil, fruits, salt and others, while countries like Zambia, Lesotho and Namibia minimised their lists of zero-rated products to items such as rice, vegetables and eggs.
MPs described Chinamasa as one of the “sane” and reasonable ministers in President Robert Mugabe’s government.
“He is so good, he is the only minister who does not have Zanu PF DNA. The steps taken by Chinamasa are good because the goods were basic necessities for Zimbabweans and the impact of taxing them is huge in terms of the cost of living,” Binga North MP, Prince Dubeko Sibanda said.
Meanwhile, MPs blasted corrupt tendencies in State procurement procedures, saying the Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets Bill, which went through the Committee stage in the National Assembly, must address regional and gender discrimination in the award of tenders, as well as corruption.
MDC legislator Priscilla Misihairabwi-Mushonga said there was so much discriminàtion that tenders were confined to Harare only and regions like Matabeleland and women never got tenders.
“Are you saying all people from Matabeleland are so daft that they cannot get into economic issues?” she said.
Dangamvura-Chikanga MP, Esau Mupfumi said she was being tribalistic, but Speaker of the National Assembly Jacob Mudenda discarded the point of order, saying there was nothing tribalistic about raising issues of marginalisation of certain provinces, adding there were Shona people in Bulawayo just as there were Ndebeles in Harare.

Zimbabwe,9679,zimlive.com,2018-07-17T17:20:30Z,ZimChem cries foul over Chinese exports,"GWERU – Zimbabwe Chemicals Refiners (ZimChem) says it is unable to meet local demand for tar because Chinese firms who have taken over the crude tar mining at Hwange prefer the more lucrative export market.
ZimChem Managing Director Tendai Shoko said Zimbabwe’s financial crisis meant the Chinese miners were more interested in overseas exports which pay in hard currency.
“Currently we’ve two batteries that are operational in the country and they’re owned by Chinese business people in Hwange,” Shoko said, speaking during a Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) meeting focusing on consolidating value chains within local industries.
“Now, on the issue of value chain we would be very happy to get all the tar from the Chinese to process it as ZimChem and also support the timber industry and the road construction industry.
“But because of the shortage of foreign currency, the Chinese are here to make money and they need to produce their tar and get the US dollar which they will repatriate back to their country. As a result, they would prefer to sell that commodity to South African markets than to give Zimbabwean manufacturers or processing companies. That’s our dilemma.”
The Redcliff-based company has no alternative as the two batteries in Hwange are the only source of raw materials in the production of tar.
“We can only pay by transferring money into their accounts,” said Shoko, “we’re not able to give them the US dollar so to them it’s not favourable. They would rather export the raw material to South Africa which actually breaks down the essence of value chains in the country.
“So what happens in the end is that road construction companies are importing primary Bitumen and other materials which we can produce locally in Zimbabwe.
“Timber treatment companies, the likes of Border Timbers and Allied Timbers, are importing timber treatment chemicals which we can actually produce locally. So that’s the problem that we have and we really need support in that aspect.”
CZI President Sifelani Jabangwe said the chamber will look into the issue and call for a discussion on the way forward or find ways to coerce the Chinese to cooperate as the country drives for import substitution to save unnecessary foreign currency expenditure.
“We really need Import substitutions to minimise foreign currency going out. We need to find a way for them to be coerced to cooperate or discuss so that we find the best way forward,” Jabangwe told the conference.
“Let’s put the camps together because maybe the foreign currency that the Chinese companies want is just 30 percent of the total amount we are spending on those imports.
“There’s no reason why ZimChem should be struggling when there’s demand for its products and the supply is local. Alternatively, we can see how another battery can be set up so that they can supply you directly.”
ZimChem processes crude tar to manufacture a wide range of chemical products which include road construction products, adhesives, paints and veterinary products, among others.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Gweru'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa']}",trade_financial_sanction,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese']

China says illegal sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the United States of America have resulted in economic decay, the shortage of medicines and loss of lives of innocent people. Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Guo Shaochun says in an op-ed in The Herald today, that sanctions have undermined the environment for economic development here.
Ambassador Guo saw the sanctions through the prism of the ongoing trade war between China and the US, which have global ramifications, amid a geopolitical tussle between the two countries.

ZIMBABWE will not preoccupy itself with sanctions by some Western capitals but will continue to work with progressive friendly nations to grow its economy, President Mnangagwa has said.Further, President Mnangagwa reiterated that after the July 30 elections, focus now should be on economic development.The Head of State and Government and Commander in Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces made the remarks in an exclusive interview with China Global Television Network on the sidelines of the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation Summit held in Beijing this week.“We, as Zimbabweans, should say what potential do we have, what resources do we have, how do we exploit these resources to help grow our economy, to help bring better life to our people rather that say oh let us cry and say those who have imposed sanctions must remove them,” said President Mnangagwa.“They have their own reasons but we are not going to sleep because those people have imposed sanctions on us. We must ourselves make sure we do that which is possible. The world is not one basket. There are so many baskets in terms of international economic environment. There are so many headquarters in the global picture who are very friendly to Zimbabwe. We are saying in our view everyone should be friendly but those who choose not to be, we have no cause to have trouble with them. We will continue to consolidate the goodwill which we are receiving from other capitals in the world and again I should say that there is now a transition to a new world order and those who don’t see it are blind,” he said.President Mnangagwa said his Government would continue to create an environment conducive for investment.Said the President: “Now the political struggle is over, that is in relation to elections. It’s behind us. It must now take the back seat. What takes the front seat is the economic struggle. To do so, we need to institute various economic reforms in order to attract both global capital into Zimbabwe as well as to give confidence to all-weather friends who have stood with us throughput the two decades to continue to support us. And consolidate that relationship by also helping ourselves by creating an environment in the country where capital should feel comfort.”President Mnangagwa continued: “I can assure you what is critically important is to be transparent, is to admit where policies in the past were constraining economic development and make legislative amendments to improve the environment in the economic sphere, for instance the area of indigenisation which was constraining (investment) into our country. We have already attended to that. The issue of the cost of doing business, the ease of doing business, the world is now very competitive in the area of attracting investment in to the country.“Even at the level of domestic investment, we have done a lot to remove archaic legislation that was constraining economic growth in our country.”President Mnangagwa said the fact that Africa had a young population was an advantage and Governments should optimise that and create an environment that empowers the youths.He said he was impressed by the quality of the current crop of African leaders whose emphasis was economic development.“Political issues are necessary to keep unity in a country, to keep countries united and foster peace its important,” said President Mnangagwa.“But at the end of the day what is critically important is the growth of the economy, the uplifting of the standard of life of your people. The creation of a strong middle class in every economy is important. Those are my views. I believe with the statements that are coming out far different from before where political environment was important, the issue of independence, the issue of sovereignty was critical, now you see most of the leaders addressing economic issues, integration, initially at regional level but also we have to migrate to continental and international level. Yes, of course we have big economies who in my view are taking two steps backward, one step forward but we don’t need to follow that.“We need ourselves to continue with one step ahead without going back again as other big economies are doing.”",0,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing']}",trade_financial_sanction,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Beijing']"
Zimbabwe,4774,zimbabwesituation.com,2015-09-11T08:30:47Z,Chinamasa castigates fellow ministers over sanctions,"FINANCE minister Patrick Chinamasa on Thursday said the International Monetary Fund (IMF)was not imposing its policies on Zimbabwe, adding that discussions under the Staff-Monitored Programme have been brutal, frank and cordial.
Addressing delegates attending a roundtable discussion entitled Economic Prospects for Zimbabwe and Re-engagement Process, Chinamasa said: “I don’t think we should be apologetic for seeking to become sound managers of our economy. What would you criticise if we agree that we will spend more on infrastructure and social services?” he said.
“To the critics, let’s zero in on the policies. Don’t politicise the discussion. Let’s dwell on the policy.”
Chinamasa also urged fellow Cabinet ministers to stop being cry-babies, but seek ways to circumvent the Western sanctions that have been blamed for causing the current economic crisis.
This was after Foreign Affairs minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi said he found it strange that the discussion did not include sanctions imposed by the Western countries.
“It’s odd, so I decided to be the one to raise the issue. Re-engagement in our context is referred to as engagement with the international community, the re-engagement is with Western countries as Zimbabwe has no problem with Africa, Asia and Latin America, that is the overwhelming majority of the international community,” Mumbengwegwi said.
“We need to be clear when we are talking about the re-engagement that what we are talking about is the Western community and we should be concerned when our relations are not as they are supposed to be. But all around this table there is nothing wrong with Zimbabwe. There are countries worse than Zimbabwe and are not under sanctions,” he said.
In response, Chinamasa said while in reality the country was under sanctions, it should craft strategies to have the embargo lifted.
“We should work out strategies to get those sanctions lifted, that means more engagement with those countries that say sanctions should continue. We should talk to them and we should consider it as a process, but before sanctions are lifted we should not sit down and cry. Sanctions undermine our capacity to honour our debts to creditors,” he said.
Chinamasa said the country owed a number of countries and has to re-engage the creditors.
“If we ignore that reality, we will not go anywhere, we just go in a vicious circle. We must engage, we’ve to engage, if we don’t, we are shutting all avenues for development,” he said.
Chinamasa said the endgame to re-engagement “is to reach an accommodation with creditors in order to clear our arrears, to get new money and to access capital markets which Zimbabwe currently is not able to do”.",0,,,"{'None': ['Africa', 'Asia'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe']}",trade_financial_sanction,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']
Zimbabwe,8953,zimbabwesituation.com,2018-01-11T12:38:48Z,Govt against ‘catastrophic’ price controls: Chinamasa,"FINANCE minister Patrick Chinamasa says government will not impose price controls, but will engage business in the face of continuing price hikes of basic goods and services.
Zimbabwe’s inflation, which broke out of negative territory last February after nearly three years, has been rising on the back of a foreign currency crisis. The country imports most of its goods after the collapse of the productive sector, anchored on agriculture, following the seizure of commercial farms over a decade ago.
A foreign currency shortage, which intensified over the past two years on a widening trade gap, has seen most businesses funding their imports using expensive cash sourced from a revived parallel forex market.
Zimbabwe, which dollarised in 2009 after its currency was decimated when hyperinflation reached 500 billion percent in December 2008, introduced a local parallel currency to ease a bank note shortage in November 2016.
The surrogate currency, pegged at parity to the United States dollar, is trading at a discount of as much as 70 percent on the parallel forex market, triggering price increases for mostly imported goods.
“It will be catastrophic for us to put price controls. So we have opted to have dialogues with them (retailers and producers) and we have discovered through these that there is no basis at all for them to hike prices,” Chinamasa said at a Zimbabwe National Roads Authority (Zinara) update meeting held in Mutare last week.
Chinamasa, however, insisted that foreign currency shortages were not driving price hikes, arguing that strategic imports such as fuel continue to get their foreign currency from government. But trade bodies have said businesses were getting as much as half of their forex needs from the black market, as the central bank was struggling to meet demand.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who succeeded long-serving President Robert Mugabe in November last year after the veteran politician was forced to resign under pressure from the military and his party, has made economic recovery his top priority.
Chinamasa conceded that Zimbabwe’s economy was afflicted by low levels of confidence, which the new government was working hard to resolve.
“The main illness of any economy is confidence and trust. There is no confidence (in Zimbabwe). This is why the President is working hard to restore confidence,” Chinamasa said.
He added that social-media driven speculation and rumours also had a destabilising effect on the markets.
“People need to know the implications of what they say. If you wake up and say there is a shortage when there is no such thing, you will erase what has been built for months or years in just one day,” said Chinamasa.
He made reference of the September 2017 market frenzy and price hikes, which he attributed to social media speculation.
The previous administration had introduced a separate Ministry of Cyber Security, to which Chinamasa was briefly deployed in an October 2017 reshuffle, to clamp down on social media abuse.

Zimbabwe,7784,newsday.co.zw,2017-04-07T00:00:00Z,"Chinamasa threatens cash-hoarding retailers, wholesalers","FINANCE minister Patrick Chinamasa yesterday threatened to enforce the Banking Use Promotions Act to deal with suspected cash-hoarding retailers and wholesalers as the cash crisis worsens.
BY VENERANDA LANGA
Chinamasa told MPs that some companies were being monitored daily and the culprits could have their trading licences cancelled.
“The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), through its Financial Intelligence Unit, has been positioning people at traders to find out cash sales of that day and how much was banked. We are going to intensify those efforts and it will not stop us from passing a law that any businessperson who does not bank money will have his licence withdrawn,” Chinamasa said.
“We have instances where on a daily basis $1,5 million is received, but only $35 000 is banked and if it is bond notes, they are hoarding them to buy foreign currency on the black market and they must stop because we are going to take stern measures to bring these saboteurs to book,” he said, adding that $104 000 worth of bond notes was expected to be circulating in the economy.
Chinamasa said the country currently had 33 000 point-of-sale machines, adding there was need to import more to enable all traders, including vendors, to adopt use of plastic money.
He said the Bank Use Promotions Act compels traders to bank surplus cash on a daily basis.
“We have observed that most traders operating in businesses reserved for locals like public transport, retail shops, hairdressing salons and others are abusing their operations in the reserved sectors by not banking, and we will cancel their licences.”
Chinamasa said to date three traders had been arrested and appeared before the courts where they pleaded guilty and would be sentenced soon for not banking proceeds from their daily cash sales.
He said other factors fuelling the cash shortages included the high fiscal deficit exacerbated by the current account deficit and government’s employment costs, currently standing at above 93% of revenue, where salaries are paid through electronic transfer (RTGS) causing a misalignment when civil servants withdraw their salaries from the banks.
“This is the greatest cause of queues for cash as both RBZ and banks will be required to withdraw foreign currency from nostro accounts to meet cash requirements. Non-banking of cash by major traders is also causing cash shortages and queues and this indiscipline is counter-productive and cannot continue to be tolerated as money is like blood and needs to be circulated for the economy to survive,” Chinamasa said.

Zimbabwe,13927,herald.co.zw,2023-01-01T15:42:33Z,Export ban means Chinese firms will have to build plants in Zimbabwe to process lithium,"Export ban means Chinese firms will have to build plants in Zimbabwe to process lithium
Zimbabwe, with the largest reserves of lithium in Africa, took a bold step and banned all raw lithium exports after the government argued smuggling of the sought-after mineral to South Africa and the UAE was costing the country US$1.8 billion in lost mining earnings.
Chinese companies that have made multimillion-dollar acquisitions in Zimbabwe will have to build lithium processing plants after the southern African nation banned the export of the metal in its raw form.
Companies must either set up local processing plants or provide proof of exceptional circumstances – and receive written permission from the government – before lithium can leave the country.
Zimbabwe is estimated to have the largest unexploited reserve of lithium in Africa and is the sixth-largest producer in the world.
It imposed the export ban last week, as part of efforts to have lithium – the key raw material in electric-vehicle batteries – processed locally.
The government also wants to stop artisanal miners who reportedly dig up and take the mineral across borders. Harare says it has lost US$1.8 billion in mineral revenues due to smuggling, artisanal mining and externalisation to South Africa and the United Arab Emirates.
Chris Berry, president of commodities advisory firm House Mountain Partners in New York, said the export ban was a textbook example of resource nationalism.
“We saw the same example with Indonesia with nickel and Chile even tried to build a deeper lithium supply chain several years ago, though those circumstances were different and the country didn’t attempt to ban lithium exports, but instead levied huge royalties on lithium producers in the country,” Berry said.
Chinese firms that had made recent lithium investments in Zimbabwe would need to build processing facilities there at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars so they can export higher value lithium chemicals, he said.
“There is a great deal of capital required to build chemical conversion facilities outside of China, not to mention the two- or three-year lead time necessary to actually complete construction and commissioning,” he said.
Berry added that if more countries followed suit, it could have wider implications – such as higher prices for lithium and other raw materials such as cobalt.
Lithium prices have surged by about 1,100 per cent to a record in the past two years, with supply struggling to keep up with high demand. Lithium carbonate spot prices in China – the world’s biggest electric-vehicle market climbed to a record US$84,000 per tonne in November, according to Benchmark Minerals’ lithium price index.
In the past year, three Chinese companies – Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, Sinomine Resource Group and Chengxin Lithium Group – have acquired lithium projects in Zimbabwe worth a combined US$679 million, amid the worldwide race to go green.
Huayou Cobalt and Chengxin Lithium are already developing processing plants that would mean they are exempt from the export ban.
Huayou Cobalt acquired the Arcadia hard-rock lithium mine outside Harare for US$422 million from Australian company Prospect Resources last year. The battery maker told the South China Morning Post in September that it was investing US$300 million to develop the mine with an aim to expand production for the electric-vehicle market.
When Huayou Cobalt bought Prospect’s stake in the mine, one of the conditions from the Zimbabwean government was that the firm would process the mineral locally to make lithium-ion batteries.
The company said it would process first-line lithium concentrates of spodumene and petalite in the first phase.
“We are not going to export raw ore,” Huayou Cobalt said. “Lithium is one of many inputs needed for the production of batteries – and we do not enjoy access to all others at the same time. In phase two of our work here, we are targeting production of lithium sulphates, and that is as far as we can see feasible under local conditions.”
Meanwhile, Chengxin Lithium spent US$77 million on a deal last year that includes mining rights in the largely unexplored Sabi Star lithium and tantalum mine project in eastern Zimbabwe. A groundbreaking ceremony was held there earlier this month for a US$130 million lithium processing plant.
Lauren Johnston, a China-Africa researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs, said that “if African and Chinese interests diverge on minerals, and since Europe wants them [minerals] too, it might be most efficient to do the process at source and then share the fruits across those markets”.
She said this was especially the case if the manufacturing could be done from renewable energy sources in the first instance, like hydrogen.
But she said “if more African countries ban the export of key renewable minerals but are not ready yet to do the processing at home due to governance, infrastructure, energy and labour challenges, then this could impede the development of renewables globally”.
According to Gorden Moyo, director of the Public Policy and Research Institute of Zimbabwe, the export ban was long overdue.
“It makes perfect economic sense for Zimbabwe and all other countries to break the vicious circle of commodity export,” said Moyo, a former Zimbabwean minister for state enterprises.
“Raw materials fetch low prices in the global markets while at the same time exporting commodities is equivalent to exporting jobs.”
He noted that lithium was a key mineral in the clean energy transition. “If well managed, the massive lithium deposits in Zimbabwe may contribute towards public debt settlement, job creation and increased economic activity in the country,” Moyo said.
But he said the export ban would not stop smuggling.
“In reality the ban is meaningless simply because there is no political will to curb illicit mineral trade in Zimbabwe,” Moyo said, adding that it was being carried out by “military businessmen and women, senior government officials and politically exposed persons”.

Zimbabwe,13323,thestandard.co.zw,2022-01-29T22:00:58Z,Chinese quarry mine unsettles Byo residents amid bribery claims,"SITHANDEKILE Dube* is jolted by yet another heavy blast that just shook her house in Bulawayo’s Pumula North high-density suburb.
The blasts have become a common occurrence in the bustling neighbourhood after a Chinese firm, Haulin Investments (Pvt) Limited, set up a quarry mine in the suburb in 2021.
Hualin was given the nod to set up the quarry mine by the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) and the contract is valid for 10 years.
Investigations by CITE revealed that residents such as Dube, who are directly affected by the mining operations near Pumula High School, were not aware of the nature of the Chinese company’s operations prior to its licensing due to the alleged manipulation of the mandatory community consultations by bigwigs.
The residents, who now have to endure the noise pollution from the quarry site and the risk of having their properties damaged by the heavy blasts, say they suspect the Chinese circumvented Environmental Management Authority (EMA) processes after compromising some community leaders, including their councillor.
“It’s now a nightmare living here,” Dube said.
Patrick Ndlovu, a Pumula resident, said Hualin’s operations were shrouded in secrecy.
Council documents obtained by CITE showed that Hualin was initially given the nod to start operations on Stand 26102 in Pumula South on July 1, 2020, before it was moved to the new site in Pumula North under unclear circumstances.
The license was for an initial period of 10 years subject to review by the local authority.
Hualin’s monthly rentals were pegged at $5 000 per hectare, subject to a periodic review and an additional levy of $20 000 once a year.
Residents say the fees were too low given the risks posed by the quarry mining activities to the environment and their properties.
Khumbulani Maphosa, the coordinator of Matabeleland Institute for Human Rights (MIHR), whose organisation is involved in environmental monitoring, said the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) process for the mine was done during the lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and this meant that the affected residents were sidelined.
“The shifting of the mine from Pumula South as per the council resolution to Pumula North is dodgy because it’s not clear how it really happened,” Maphosa said.
Maphosa claimed that some Pumula residents were deliberately excluded from the consultative processes in order to manipulate the outcome in favour of the Chinese.
“The mining company is refusing to make the EIA report public,” he said.
According to an EIA report published in April 2021, Hualin through its consultant, Malnkosi Consultants used both formal and informal interviews with a cross-section of stakeholders.
“The results of the public consultation process showed that people need the project since it would contribute to the economic turnaround of the country,” read the report which was attached with signatures of participants.
Residents, however, insisted that there were no proper consultations before the quarry mine was set up.
Given Mangena, who is the leader of the Unemployed Patriotic Youth Association leader, said some stakeholders were deliberately excluded after they raised uncomfortable questions about the project.
Mangena said the questions raised via WhatsApp groups centred around concerns over pollution, damage to the environment and employment opportunities for local youths.
“The company said it will not employ people directly but the problem is that we are no longer involved in the process,” he said.
“It seems the company is only working with a certain clique and holding its own caucuses. We once added the Chinese miner to our group where people asked him questions and I was persecuted for allowing such to happen.”
On December 8, 2021, after pressure from the community, Bulawayo Progressive Residents Association (BPRA) organised a meeting with Hualin, company director Huang Hua, where the residents aired their grievances.
Haung assured residents that his company would take responsibility for any damages to the environment and properties.
He insisted that the quarry mine met all the legal requirements.
Another meeting was held on December 22, 2021, over the same issue where participants claimed that some of the people that were interviewed for the EIA were paid between US$10 and S$15 to influence the outcome of the study.
The residents also claimed that Huang handed out food donations to some community leaders during EIA study to influence the process.
“Leaders in the community should not use the company as a tool to improve their political mileage, that is wrong, the whole community must benefit,” Ndlovu said.
On December 24, 2021, at another meeting, Ward 17 councillor, Sikhululekile Moyo, said public consultations were held, but they were disrupted by the Covid-19 lockdowns.
“We called representatives of BPRA, the Bulawayo United Residents Association (BURA), Mthwakazi Residents Association and area section leaders including ward committees, who are elected by residents, not me,” Moyo said.
“When they met, they discussed the disadvantages and advantages. Minutes of all the meetings were attached to the documents sent to EMA.”
Moyo said the area where the mine was set up was designated for quarry mining in Bulawayo’s city masterplan.
There would be other quarry mines in Entumbane, Luveve, Pumula East, Robert Sinyoka, Pumula North.”
Moyo said the council invited bids for the proposed quarry mines in 2017, “no one showed interest” until Hualin came forward.
“An Indian, a local company and another Chinese came forward for other sites,” she added.
“These went through the protocols with EMA and the Ministry of Mines. In 2020, Hualin was advised that the place was theirs and they had to meet with residents in the affected area.
“However, EMA was clear that engagements didn’t stop, people can still write and hand in their reports to EMA. It’s more important to go to EMA than going to a newspaper.”
The councillor also dismissed allegations that she was one of the community leaders, who were allegedly bribed by the Chinese.
“As for the allegations against me, those who are making them can go to the police and I also have the right to go to the police,” she added.
“Let the law take its course.”
Moyo, however, admitted that she received groceries on behalf of residents from Hualin, but did not elaborate on the matter.
Bulawayo deputy mayor Mlandu Ncube defended the location of the mine in Pumula, saying the zoning was in accordance with the city’s master plan.
“According to our council report, everything was done lawfully. When we advertise and someone shows interest, they follow council procedures and we make a decision on procedures followed,” Ncube said.
“When someone comes in for a project, they must consult residents or a certain number of properties. When those people are consulted, the sender of the information comes back with a response of registered mail and then the council confirms whether these are proper addresses in those areas, which the council did.
“It confirmed the membership that those are people who live there so the consultation was done.”
However, the deputy mayor could also not confirm if the company “bought people or not.”
“We don’t know, we were not there, there’s no one who has proof of this,” he said.
Ncube said the quarry mining venture was creating employment for locals and helping in curbing crime.
“People were now killing each other in that rocky area. We also expect the company to play its part of social responsibility so they will fix that road from Pumula North and Methodist Village,” he said.
“For how long will we sit staring at those rocks, those rocks must bring revenue. If you go now to Robert Sinyoka or Methodist villages –individuals have been poaching sand, until someone’s house sunk into a pit.
“How do you compensate for that? This could have been avoided if there is someone to hold responsible. If a company caused the destruction of that property, we will know who to follow.
“I’m not saying the miner must destroy people’s houses, but if residents say their houses have developed cracks there will be someone who will be held responsible.”

Zimbabwe,13077,newsday.co.zw,2021-10-05T22:00:51Z,Ex-NetOne boss nails down Mandiwanzira,"BY MIRIAM MANGWAYA
FORMER NetOne chief executive officer Reward Kangai has implored Prosecutor-General Kumbirai Hodzi to expedite prosecution of the US$4 million corruption scandal in the parastatal which involved former Information and Communication Technology minister Supa Mandiwanzira.
Kangai is the State witness in the matter in which Mandiwanzira is being accused of interfering in the operations of mobile communication provider, NetOne, by allegedly corruptly handpicking a Chinese firm to investigate Huawei, with the investigating company set to be paid US$4 million.
He claims that he is still being victimised by individuals involved in the scandal, adding that there was interference with the course of justice on handling the matter which he reported to authorities in 2016.
On September 28, 2021, Kangai wrote to Hodzi informing him that he had approached several authorities, including the late former President Robert Mugabe, to have the culprits brought to book, to no avail.
In the letter gleaned by NewsDay, copied to Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) chairperson Loice Matanda-Moyo, and Justice secretary Virgina Mabhiza, Kangai said Hodzi risked destroying public confidence in the justice delivery system if he allowed the culprits to escape from the long arm of the law.
“As prosecutor-general, you have been reported in the Press as lamenting about the existence of cartels that have seriously affected the justice delivery system in Zimbabwe in the fight against corruption …,” Kangai wrote.
“I am, therefore, surprised that you would miss such a golden opportunity to deal with the cartels in that system, slip through your fingers as the above subject matter is replete with corruption from the investigation stages to through trial, including victimisation of the whistleblower.
“I am, therefore, appealing to you sir to allow the justice system to run its course as the matter provides that rare opportunity to deal with the very cartels that you, His Excellency President (Emmerson) ED Mnangagwa, and Hon Justice Matanda Moyo lament about.”
Kangai said despite provision of all the necessary evidence for justice to prevail, the culprits had not been brought to book due to deliberate interference in the justice system, six years on.
“This is not a matter between the accused person and myself, but much to do with the collective interest of the Zimbabwean nation, that is, to effectively rid country of the corruption scourge ,” Kangai said.
He said the country’s huge economic potential could never be realised when corruption was as deeply embedded in State institutions.
After the US$4 million scandal was exposed, Kangai was fired from NetOne and later arrested by Zacc on corruption charges.

Zimbabwe,193,newsday.co.zw,2012-04-28T00:00:00Z,"Chinamasa attacks corrupt prison officers, lawyers","Justice and Legal Affairs minister Patrick Chinamasa yesterday castigated corrupt prison officers and accused them of fuelling the vice in the justice delivery system.
Chinamasa made the remarks during a handover of 500 prisoners’ uniforms donated by the Law Society of Zimbabwe, as part of its corporate social responsibility programmes.
“I had singled out prisons as being free from corruption within the judiciary system, but I was told that’s where it starts,” Chinamasa said.
“I am told they tell prisoners which lawyer, police officer, prosecutor or magistrate to go to. In fact, there are senior counsels who give advice to accused persons on who to corrupt at the courts,” he added.
The minister also lamented the quality of some of the current lawyers whom he said did not match those from the days he was still a practising lawyer.
“I receive reports from judges that the quality of the legal profession has gone down and I am happy to note you have embarked on a comprehensive skills programme,” said Chinamasa.
“When my time is up, I would want to go back to my profession, it’s not in the same state as it was when I left it. Now there is a lot of corruption and it has lost its integrity. I care and I am anxious about the profession and would wish it to shine,” he added.
Chinamasa also said his ministry and the Zimbabwe Prison Service were sourcing funds to improve conditions in prison.
“Our idea is to present a prison whose conditions are humane not forgetting all of us here are potential candidates. Presently conditions are not good there but better than three years ago,” he said drawing laughter from the gathering.
Law Society of Zimbabwe president Tinoziva Bere said the prison garb was acquired from proceeds of last year’s fund-raising show which raised
$36 000.
Turning to the issue of delays in processing documents by the Deeds Office and Registrar of Companies, Chinamasa said he hoped they would soon improve on their efficiency as there were plans to have them operate as stand-alone offices.
The society also presented a scholarship to a needy University of Zimbabwe law student, Josephine Chiname.

Zimbabwe,3092,zimbabwesituation.com,2014-09-15T12:39:41Z,Corruption: Let’s be ruthless like China,"FINANCE Minister Patrick Chinamasa has said if the fight against corruption is to be successful, Zimbabwe must be prepared to be ruthless like China where no one is untouchable and top politicians and business executives have been jailed over graft.
Corruption is cited as one of Zimbabwe’s major problems but a government campaign this year which saw top executives at parastatals exposed for earning massive salaries while the companies teetered on the brink of collapse lost steam after it got caught up in Zanu PF’s succession fights.
Vice President Joice Mujuru attacked the anti-graft campaign claiming it was the work of infiltrators trying to destroy Zanu PF from within.
An order by the treasury pegging salaries for parastatal executives at $6,000 has also been ignored.
However, addressing a breakfast meeting in Harare last week, Chinamasa, who recently returned from China where he accompanied President Robert Mugabe to seek financial support for the economy, said Zimbabwe could learn from China’s ruthless methods.
Early this year Chinese President Xi Jinping described corruption as a “disease that calls for powerful drugs” and announced even stronger measures against graft which have seen top members of the Communist Party elite thrown into jail.
Said Chinamasa: “What l learnt from the Chinese basically is that they are a very efficient people and ruthless in achieving goals.
“l mean, they are ruthless, whether in terms of stamping out corruption, whether in removing deadwood in management, they are very ruthless and as a result their parastatals are among the top 500 companies worldwide.
“When we compare to ours it was very clear that when we come to parastatal reform, we have not scratched the surface; if we can have the ruthlessness that the Chinese have, the better.”
Chinamasa said Zimbabwe could also learn from the work ethic of the Chinese who, through sheer hard work, have seen their economy grow to become the second biggest in the world after the United States.
He said, unlike Zimbabweans, the Chinese were not an “8 to 5pm” people but they work until tasks are complete without even demanding extra in terms of overtime.
The minister also defended the decision by the Chinese to hire their own nationals as labourers in foreign countries.
“In fact, their impatience when they come to some countries is that they can’t drive local labour with the speed and efficiency that they are used to in China,” he said.
Zimbabwe has in the past 15 years cultivated closer ties with China after Western governments imposed targeted sanctions on Mugabe and his lieutenants for human rights violations and failure to uphold democracy.
But the Look-East policy has yielded very little in terms of rewards with critics saying Mugabe’s desperation has invariably opened up his mineral rich country to daylight plunder by the Chinese.
Chinamasa was however, adamant Harare has engaged Beijing on an equal footing in attempts to dispel assertions Zimbabwe had virtually turned into a Chinese colony.
The outspoken government official took issue with local journalists who have dismissed his so-called mega deals with the Chinese as “a pie in the sky”.
“What l expect, especially from business reporters, is constructive engagement,” he said, adding that he has remained very accessible to everybody who wished to seek clarification on Zimbabwe’s highly contentious Chinese dealings.
“So let’s not be abusive of each other. If you have any serious comment or advice, write it and we will consider it…but when you abuse you are just dispiriting, just discouraging information which does not do any good to the person saying it or to the country.”",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare']}",bribery_economic_corruption,"['Xi Jinping', 'China']","['Xi Jinping', 'China']","['China', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,6082,zimbabwesituation.com,2016-04-17T13:55:09Z,Impediments in fighting corruption revealed,"VARIOUS impediments still stand in the way of efforts to address rampant corruption eating into the core of the social, political and economic fabric of the Zimbabwean society, stakeholders have said.
By Byron Mutingwende
Stakeholders attendeding a national anti-corruption policy dialogue organised by Transparency International Zimbabwe in Harare on Thursday, said the United Nations Convention against Corruption — which the country signed in 2004 before ratifying in 2007 — was being violated.
Chief law officer in the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), Chris Mutangadura, said the seriousness of the State in combating corruption was reflected in the National Budget.
“The NPA received just over $200 000 from Treasury in the 2016 National Budget. Corruption is a big issue perpetrated by people with money and political power,” he said.
“Look at people who are funding soccer for example. Prosecutors and magistrates are lawyers, but they get pathetic salaries. They have to do the national duty of investigating corruption issues like the Salarygate and Asiagate scandals, which require financial resources to be done thoroughly and comprehensively.”
Mutangadura was of the view that the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) be given powers to investigate and arrest perpetrators of corruption through legislative reforms.
“There is need to set up a Special Economic Crimes Court, such as in Kenya and Namibia,” he said.
One of the participants said the political leadership should set the tone for zero tolerance of corruption, as exemplified by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has a tough stance against graft, even among the elite.
Prominent lawyer, Theresa Mugadza, called on all relevant stakeholders to emulate a strategy adopted on HIV and Aids to fight corruption.
She said the effects of corruption were worse than those of the pandemic because where the vice thrived, the nation would not have the capacity to feed its people and deal with drought and there were will be a shortage of essential drugs in clinics and hospitals.
“It’s sad to note that people are fast to go to tabloids to report petty issues about sex and polygamy, instead of whistle-blowing on corruption,” Mugadza said.
She said it was folly to continuously talk about corruption without arresting perpetrators implicated after thorough investigations, adding there was need to set up a national target of dealing with corruption.
Michael Mataure, the Parliamentary Affairs and Parliamentary Support Trust executive director, said there was need to condemn corruption from an early age, even among primary school children.
“Fighting corruption should be a part of us and I am glad the Ministry of Education is rolling out a new curriculum that also emphasises on the sense of identity,” he said.
Chitungwiza North legislator and member of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Finance and Economic Development, Godfrey Sithole, said there was need for the legislature and Zacc to work together in fighting corruption.
He urged the anti-corruption body to submit all reports on corruption to Parliament.
“Zacc should bring to Parliament all events on the ground pertaining to corruption. Zacc and police detectives on fraud should hold periodic meetings on how to deal with corruption so that we walk together with one purpose,” Sithole said.
Another participant said there was need to publicise the functions of the various anti-corruption institutions and encourage citizens to use the agencies that fight graft.
Mary-Jane Ncube, the executive director of TI-Z, hailed the establishment of a national code of corporate governance for the private sector, which has since been adopted by the government.
She called for the full implementation of the code.
“Zimbabwe should consolidate all corruption-related legislative matters in one law to create a comprehensive legal framework and examine ways to enhance coordination among the different institutions,” Ncube said.
The TI-Z boss called for the establishment of legislative and related measures that cover persons performing unpaid services or functions for the State or a public enterprise, bribery (active and passive) of foreign public officials and officials of public international organisations and a system of asset and income declarations applicable to high-level public officials.
She said Zimbabwe should consider corruption offences as serious enough to qualify as predicate crimes for money-laundering.
There was need to enhance the fines specified in the Criminal Law to deter legal persons from engaging in corruption, Ncube said.
The anti-corruption watchdog called for the adoption of provisions on criminalisation of foreign bribery and improvement of legislation on protection of witnesses, experts and victims and on liability of legal persons.
TI-Z said it was incumbent upon the country to consolidate existing legislation by adoption of stand-alone acts on laundering of proceeds of crime as well as on protection of whistle-blowers.

Zimbabwe,7066,newsday.co.zw,2016-11-19T00:00:00Z,Mines ministry official in $25 000 Chinese bribe storm,"A 32-YEAR-OLD Ministry of Mines official, who is being accused of demanding $25 000 bribe money from a Chinese mining firm, was on Thursday furnished with a trial date.
BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE
He will be tried on December 6.
Gift Moyo, who is an inspector in the ministry, appeared before Harare magistrate Arnold Maburo.
The complainant in the matter is a Chinese mining company, represented by Li Qianzhon.
Allegations are that sometime in June this year, Moyo and two other males went to Qianzhon Mine in Mazowe purportedly to carry out some inspections at the mine.
The State alleges they later met one Walter Muwoni, who was having a labour dispute with the mining firm over termination of his contract and had threatened to expose the firm’s illegal operations.
Moyo and his colleagues, it is alleged, approached the firm’s geologist, a Dr Feng, and informed him they wanted to inspect the mine’s records and site, after which they searched through the documents and later went on to the mine site for inspection.
The three are said to have found mining explosives over-stored by 50kg and asked mine employees to load them into their vehicle, indicating they were taking them away.
During the loading of the explosives, Moyo allegedly went to the firm’s office and accused the firm and Feng of breaching mining regulations.
It is alleged Moyo took away all the 200kg explosives, claiming they should be destroyed, but no documentation was raised for the seizure.
He then informed Qianzhon to report at their office at the Ministry of Mines at Zimre Centre in Harare.
On June 10, the firm’s mining manager, Dr Ma, and directors Salimu Garandi, Philip Mann and Qianzhon went to Moyo’s offices, where the latter requested Garandi to surrender his full blasting licence as well as cellphone, and asked him to go out of the office.
Moyo allegedly then demanded $25 000 from the other firm directors who were in the office, claiming the mine was involved in illegal dealings and he had all evidence and threatened to cancel the mining permit, mining licence, blasting licences and to shut down the mine.
The firm’s representatives allegedly pleaded with Moyo, saying $25 000 was too much and offered to raise $10 000, but Moyo threatened to tear Garande’s blasting licence and was given $400.
Qianzhon is said to have promised to bring $10 000 the next day, but then reported the matter to the CID Fraud Squad.
A trap was set up, leading to Moyo’s arrest by police detectives, who found him with the fake notes.
Dora Moyo appeared for the State.

Editor’s Memo,Dumisani Muleya
Of late the media, especially the Zimbabwe Independent, has been exposing petty, grand and systematic corruption involving state enterprises, mainly Zesa, senior government officials, including cabinet ministers, and their cronies.
Corrupt deals involving hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions, of investment and taxpayers’ funds have been exposed.
While corruption is troubling as it gnaws away at society’s fabric and destroys the economy and people’s lives, what is even more worrying is that Mugabe doesn’t do anything about it. In fact, his office is deeply entangled in some of these murky transactions.
Consequently, Zesa and other parastatals have become looting grounds for ministers and their partners in crime.
It’s not only Wicknell Chivayo, a convicted fraudster, and his partners who have been corruptly awarded tenders worth US$400 million; Mugabe’s in-law Derrick Chikore and his US$83 million (initially US$194 million) Dema Diesel Power Plant project; Energy minister Samuel Undenge and his corrupt activities; or Vice-President Phelekezela Mphoko’s son Siqokoqela with his US$350 million usurious loan offer in the Zesa feeding trough, there is lot of rot at the state power utility.
Chivayo got US$5 million unprocedurally; Undenge received a suspicious US$200 000 payment and Mphoko’s son wanted to reap US$70 million in interest charges.
Some of ZPC’s multi-million-dollar tenders include Munyati solar (awarded to ZTE Corporation), Insukamini in Bulawayo (17 Metallurgical China) and Mutare peaking power (Helcraw). Tenders were also awarded for the 300MW Kariba South extension, 600MW Hwange 7 and 8 extension (Sino Hydro), 30MW Gairezi hydro (Intratek, BHL India, Angelique) and repowering of Bulawayo (17 Metallurgical), Munyati (Intratek, Jaguar Overseas Limited) and Harare stations (Jaguar).
In some cases, companies which initially lost the tenders ended up involved in lucrative projects. The deals were inflated by more than US$500 million amid reports of corruption and bribery.
The Kariba South Power Station Extension Project, officially commissioned by Mugabe in September 2014, was initially pegged at US$355 million, but shot up to US$533 million. The cost escalation was US$178 million.
The cost of the Gairezi Project, awarded to a consortium led by Chivayo, surged to US$248 million, up from the initial US$90 million. This created a price variance of US$158 million.
The inflated costs in total amount to US$507 million.
Energy experts say Zesa could have saved approximately US$200 million over three years had it explored cheaper alternatives in the Dema deal alone.
What is the moral of the story?
The point is government officials are looting state enterprises with impunity on a massive scale. Corruption is now one of Mugabe’s ugly legacies and it’s getting worse.
State enterprises and parastatals remain in the red as it emerged their cumulative loses and net liabilities are in excess of US$1 billion, while local authorities lost more than US$500 million through mismanagement, corruption and theft in 2015.
This is contained in latest audit reports from the Auditor-General Mildred Chiri.
In her report for the period up to December 31 2015, Chiri warned that the culture of poor corporate governance, along with the failure to implement proper revenue collection, management and debt recovery strategies, posed a huge threat to the continued existence of the loss-making parastatals. All the while, Zimbabweans live as if they are citizens of a backwater desert. Despite Zimbabwe having vast natural resources and huge human capital, Mugabe has dismally failed to manage and develop the country.
Millions live in dire frustration, hopelessness and poverty, die from preventable diseases, or flee to neighbouring countries and overseas to survive.
The greatest crisis in Zimbabwe is hence not disease, hunger or poverty, but lack of leadership — corruption being one of its most appalling manifestations.",0,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Bulawayo', 'Mutare', 'Harare'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",bribery_economic_corruption,['ZTE Corporation'],['ZTE'],[],[]
Zimbabwe,11292,newzimbabwevision.com,2020-02-18T07:36:21Z,SUSPENDED ZANU PF YOUTH LEAGUE POLITICAL COMMISSAR Tsenengamu says he is not apologetic about his anti corruption stance denying Patrick Chinamasa’s statement that he has apologised to the party for h,"SUSPENDED ZANU PF YOUTH LEAGUE POLITICAL COMMISSAR Godfrey Tsenengamu says he is not apologetic about his anti corruption stance denying Patrick Chinamasa’s statement that he has apologised to the party for his actions.
Tsenengamu said he had neither apologised nor intends to do so, in the wake of State-owned media reports that he has apologized for naming and shaming corrupt businessmen.
This follows revelations by Zanu-PF acting Secretary for Administration Patrick Chinamasa, who said Tsenengamu and his colleague Lewis Matutu have demonstrated maturity and loyalty to the party, during the time they have been reduced to ordinary card-carrying members.
The Zanu-PF Politburo censored the two a fortnight ago after they named and shamed three businessmen they said were wreaking havoc in the economy by using their links to top party and Government officials to carry out corrupt activities, plundering and looting of State resources.
Chinamasa issued a statement yesterday saying the two have agreed to undergo ideological training at the ruling party linked Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology, despite Tsenengamu having insisted that he was not going for any training.
“After serving out their suspensions, the comrades will be welcome to contest for any positions in the party,” Chinamasa said.
“The commendable development demonstrates that the disciplinary process is intended to build, not to fracture the party.
“It is pleasing to note that the two have been exemplary in accepting disciplinary measures that will, at the end of the day, make them stronger party cadres.”
But Tsenengamu, in a charged response on Twitter, accused Chinamasa of lying.
“Please don’t misinform the public. I have not apologised to anyone and l am not going to. I have not wronged the party in any way.
“I am not apologetic about fighting corruption. I will not trade off my conscience for neither a position nor 30 pieces of silver.”
Tsenengamu also insisted that he was not going to the compulsory lessons on party ideology at the Chitepo College, saying he is more ideologically sound than most Zanu-PF leaders.-

Zimbabwe,13075,newsday.co.zw,2021-10-21T22:00:46Z,Mandiwanzira lashes out at ‘malicious’ Kangai,"BY MIRIAM MANGWAYA
FORMER Information and Communication Technology minister Supa Mandiwanzira yesterday accused ex-NetOne chief executive officer Reward Kangai of maliciously attempting to drag him into the parastatal’s US$4 million corruption scandal, for which he had already been cleared by the courts.
This was after Kangai wrote to Prosecutor-General Kumbirai Hodzi on September 28, 2021 imploring him to expedite prosecution of NetOne’s million-dollar corruption scandal, which implicated Mandiwanzira, who was, however, acquitted of the charges by the High Court.
Kangai was the State witness in the matter in which Mandiwanzira was being accused of interfering in the operations of NetOne by allegedly corruptly handpicking a Chinese company, Megawatt Energy, to investigate another Chinese firm, Huawei. Megawatt was set to be paid US$4 million.
The charges were, however, quashed by the then High Court judge Justice Nicholas Mathonsi following an application for review by Mandiwanzira.
In his letter to Hodzi, Kangai claimed that he was still being victimised by unnamed individuals involved in the scandal, adding that there was interference with the course of justice in handling the matter which he reported to authorities in 2016.
He said he was fired from his post as NetOne chief executive and was, instead, arrested for corruption after having exposed the US$4 million scandal.
But through his lawyer Fungai Chimwamurombe, Mandiwanzira distanced himself from Kangai’s dismissal, saying the latter was implicated in a forensic audit report which exposed mismanagement at the parastatal, resulting in the termination of his contract.
“Mr Kangai was terminated as chief executive officer of NetOne by the nonrenewal of his contract after 15 years at the helm of the State-owned enterprise. His termination followed a damning forensic audit report by PricewaterhouseCoopers which unearthed extensive corruption and mismanagement at NetOne and directly implicated Mr Kangai,” Chimwamurombe said.
He said although Kangai had lobbied for the arrest of prosecutor Admore Nyazamba, charges against him were later withdrawn by Hodzi after he discovered that they were malicious and baseless.

Zimbabwe,14439,zimbabwesituation.com,2023-10-25T09:54:16Z,Chinese national up for fraud,"A CHINESE national based in South Africa, who is facing a fraud charge, was on Monday denied bail when he appeared before Harare magistrate Feresi Chakanyuka.
Hu Dong, who was remanded in custody to today for trial, allegedly defrauded Sunny Yi Feng Tiles Company of R2,7 million by buying tiles using fake proof of payments.
Chakanyuka denied Hu bail saying he may flee the country as he had no relatives in Zimbabwe and neither did he have any properties in the country.
State prosecutor Pardon Dziva alleged that on June 17 last year, Hu came to Zimbabwe and misrepresented to the Norton-based tiles company that he had capacity to pay for some floor tiles worth R1 007 224.
He was given the tiles which were delivered to an unknown destination in South Africa.
The State further alleged that Hu then sent a fake proof of payment to the complainant purporting that he had transferred R1 007 224 from his South African Standard Bank account.
On August 24, 2022, Hu used the same modus operandi and was given some floor tiles equivalent to R649 952, which he again delivered to an unknown destination in South Africa.
Again, he sent a fake proof of payment to the complainant purporting that he had transferred R649 952 from his South African Standard Bank account.
On 28 November 2022, Hu used the same trick and was given tiles worth R1 019 884.
The court heard that on Tuesday last week, Hu went to the complainant’s premises intending to use a similar tactic and ordered some floor tiles costing US$45 000.
But Sunny Yi Feng Tiles Company had since discovered that Hu had used fake proof of payments. He was arrested as he tried to flee from the company premises.",1,,,"{'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare']}",bribery_economic_corruption,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['Chinese', 'CHINESE']"
Zimbabwe,10399,zimbabwesituation.com,2019-04-03T06:00:06Z,Supa seeks acquittal on graft charges,"Supa Mandiwanzira
Fidelis Munyoro Chief Court Reporter
Former Minister Supa Mandiwanzira, who is embroiled in a $218 million-consultancy scandal, is seeking acquittal on charges of corruption, arguing the indictment is defective.
Mandiwanzira is one of the several high-profile figures to have been charged in court for corruption in the Second Republic in which President Mnangagwa has vowed to fight graft and cronyism.
The former Information Communication Technology and Cyber Security Minister is contesting trial magistrate Mr Elijah Makomo’s ruling, dismissing his application for exception to charges of breaching procurement regulations.
The matter will be among the cases to be heard at the High Court before Justice Nicholas Mathonsi today.
Mandiwanzira, who is accused of corruptly engaging Megawatt for consultancy services rendered to NetOne Pvt Ltd, wants the court to quash the charges and uphold his application for exception on the grounds that the charges were out-of-place because the telecommunications company was not a procuring entity.
Mr Makomo ruled that the ex-minister has a case to answer for allegedly breaching the Procurement Act.
It was the lower court’s finding that Mandiwanzira, in his capacity as minister then, could not have acted on behalf of NetOne because it had its own directors and workers.
In his application for exception to the charges, Mandiwanzira, who is being represented by Advocate Thembinkosi Magwaliba averred that he acted in public interest and recovered US$30 million that Net-One had lost in the contract for network expansion and modernisation of equipment.
If convicted, Mandiwanzira, faces a minimum prison term of 20 years, fine, or both.
Mandiwanzira is facing charges of criminal abuse of office after he allegedly awarded Megawatt Energy, a South African-based company consultancy, work to audit the US$218 954 843.00 deal between Net-One and Huawei Technologies.",1,,,{},bribery_economic_corruption,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei']

Zimbabwe,6559,zimbabwesituation.com,2016-07-09T12:10:24Z,Mandiwanzira tackles corruption claims,"INFORMATION Communications Technology minister Supa Mandiwanzira (pictured) has of late been facing corruption accusations from his critics ranging from that he was involved in dodgy deals with Megawatt Energy, the company hired to investigate overpricing of equipment to NetOne by Chinese company Huawei, to settling factional scores using his ministry. Business reporter Kudzai Kuwaza (KK) this week spoke to Mandiwanzira (SM) on these issues. Find excerpts below:
KK : Why and how did you settle for Megawatt Energy to investigate the overpricing of equipment to NetOne by Chinese Technology Company Huawei?
SM: The ministry settled on Megawatt because it is the only company that was willing to offer its services pro-bono (for free) and pro-bono publico (for the public good).It was only going to be paid a commission from what they would have recovered. So clearly the government had no cost whatsoever. They also exhibited knowledge of the ICT and the telecomms sector in Zimbabwe; that was a plus. It’s important for you to know that Megawatt is not a fly-by-night company. They are involved in big money projects, including the construction of a 175-megawatt solar energy plant in Matabeleland South for around US$350 million.
KK: NetOne CEO Reward Kangai accused you of suspending him because he refused to pay Megawatt US$4 million. He also said you are building a structure in Midrand, South Africa, through your South African-based company, Blue Nightingale Trading which you own jointly with Megawatt CE Xiaodong Li. What is your response?
SM: First of all, let’s understand that Mr Reward Kangai is a disgruntled employee who has been sent home on forced leave to pave way for a forensic audit of NetOne. The forensic audit is being done by PWC on assignment from Auditor General (Mildred Chiri). It was Mrs Chiri’s recommendation to the NetOne board that they send Mr Kangai and other top managers on forced leave in order to avoid the possibility of them destroying evidence. Clearly, it is the board’s role to take action on their management and not the minister.
Mr Kangai or NetOne have no obligation to pay Megawatt. In fact, Megawatt is paying itself from whatever it recovers. I am very happy to say that because of the ministry’s intervention — that of letting them carry out this audit — NetOne has recovered US$30 million. That’s a phenomenal figure if you consider that the ministry of ICT’s annual budget disbursement from Treasury has not exceeded $3 million of the last two years.
The allegation that I have a business partnership with Megawatt and or their owners is a lie; a complete fabrication and one that will sure have legal consequences on Mr Kangai … I have no, business with that company or its owners, whether in Zimbabwe, South Africa, China or anywhere in the world including in space. Regarding a property, that’s even crazier. I don’t own any property in South Africa. If anyone finds such a property they must take it over.
I was a director of a South African shelf company called Blue Nightingale in my previous life as an active businessman. This company was established by directors of Rainbow Cinemas in Zimbabwe as a conduit for US films which could not be shipped to Zimbabwe directly because of sanctions. It’s now history that I donated 100% of Rainbow Cinemas (shares) to employees as an empowerment initiative in 2012. That is the last I ever heard of it, dealt with it or had anything to do with Blue Nightingale.
KK: How much did the vehicles purchased for you and your deputy minister Win Mlambo using Potraz funds cost?
SM: The vehicles were bought by CMED and are owned by CMED. I am sure you are aware that CMED is a 100% government-owned company. You can check the pricing with them, but what I know for certain is that they could not have been bought for any amount above that is stipulated and set by the Office of the President and Cabinet. I have read somewhere that I am driving around in a US$200 000 car. I am not that irresponsible, please. I don’t drive a US$200 000 car. By the way, I have already stated that all procedures were followed and all authorisations were granted for these CMED purchases which were made because I was using my own personal cars to do government business.
KK: Businessman Agrippa Masiyakurima, commonly referred to as Bopela, has accused you of targeting him because he has been bankrolling the First Lady Grace Mugabe’s rallies. He also accused you of failing to service your BancABC loan. How do you respond to this?
SM: That is an abuse of the First Lady’s name and the great work she is doing for the Women’s League. Those whose companies are under the spotlight for the forensic audit must not drag her name and her good work in order to hide their shady transactions with NetOne. He must wait for the results of the forensic audit being done by the Auditor General through PWC.
I am fully aware that Mr Masiyakurima has been all over trying desperately, and with spectacular failure, to soil my integrity. From trying to misrepresent a US$200 000 debt he owed my former employers as a bribe to splashing money to party youths in Manicaland so they could pass a vote-of-no-confidence in me. He even offered cars to some of them — but it all came to nought. Now he is going around lying that minister Mandiwanzira funded this factional meeting and that factional meeting. It is all going to fail too because it’s false. When the evidence of his US$200 000 indebtedness was brought out in public to pour water on his stupid claims — he rushed to pay back the debt in full plus interest. All documentary proof of these payments is available.
As for the BancABC loan, I think the bank has a responsibility to protect its clients’ information; in terms of bank-client confidentiality. That they allow Masiyakurima’s wife, who I understand works for BancABC, to take private client information and give it to her husband to abuse it to settle personal scores is very worrying. I hope the bank will be doing something about it soon.
KK: When can we expect the audit of NetOne to be completed?
SM: I have stayed far away from the process to ensure that it’s independent of perceived or real influence by the ministry or the minister. I have been told by NetOne board that it will be completed this month.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Matabeleland South Province', 'Manicaland Province'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa', 'Midrand'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",bribery_economic_corruption,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],"['Huawei', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,10927,zimbabwesituation.com,2019-10-28T07:45:15Z,Tackling graft: Lessons from China,"In Zimbabwe, corruption has been debated and written about for quite some time, that most citizens predicted that by now corrupt elements would be facing the wrath of the law, but unfortunately the country still has a long way to go. The greatest lesson that Zanu-PF can learn from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the way they deal with corruption.
Tangible measures are in place like heavy fines, seizure of property, incarceration and in very severe cases death sentences.
It is thus imperative for the country to take lessons from China because further delays or failure to restrain corruption will ultimately ruin Zimbabwe.
Corruption causes many political, economic, social and environmental challenges.
The Chinese government, led by President Xi Jinping, is in the midst of a sweeping anti-corruption campaign that has led to thousands of arrests.
According to the Associate Press, in 2018, more than 1 000 Chinese fugitives who fled abroad were returned to the country and more than $519 million in ill-gotten gains was recovered.
These figures were confirmed by the ruling CCP in what is seen as a further victory in President Xi’s years-long drive against corruption.
The party’s anti-corruption watchdog said among the 1 335 returned, 307 were party members or government employees, including five on a list of 100 most-wanted Chinese corruption suspects handed over to Interpol.
In his book, “The Governance of China 1’, President Xi outlines his government’s practical and hardline approach to the problem.
He said historical wisdom will help the country combat corruption and uphold integrity.
“We must draw upon the fine culture of clean government in Chinese history, steadily improve the party’s leadership and governance skills, and become better able to combat corruption, prevent degeneracy and ward of risks,” said President Xi.
“To improve party conduct, uphold integrity and combat corruption, we need to continue the best practices the party has long accumulated, learn from other countries’ beneficial experiences and draw upon the valuable legacy of Chinese history.
“China’s history of combating corruption and its ancient anti-corruption culture offer enlightenment, as do the failures and successes of the past. This historical wisdom can help us do a better job in combating corruption and upholding integrity today.”
Lessons from China: Confronting the enemy within
The genuineness and commitment by President Xi’s administration to eradicate corruption is the most notable thing.
Hence, the ruling Zanu-PF party should fight corruption in all its structures. This will help curb colossal corruption evident in present-day Zimbabwe, particularly in Government structures where high-ranking bureaucrats co-opt the system and enrich themselves.
There have been reports in the media where Government officials awarded themselves or their friends State tenders, taken bribes and abused office for their personal gains.
China set up the Central Commission for Discipline and Inspection (CCDI), an internal watchdog on corruption and graft in the ruling CCP, to deal with internal corruption within the party structures.
The ruling Zanu-PF should emulate the CCDI because it is not just a paper tiger.
Said President Xi: ‘’Worms can only grow in something rotten.’’.
His emphasis that fighting corruption from within the ruling party is critical because corruption by party and government officials is the instigator.
An interesting case is that of one untouchable Bo Xilai — former member of the CCP’s Central Committee Political Bureau — who was tried on charges of taking bribes, embezzlement and abuse of power and received a life sentence.
Additionally, in March 2018, a former deputy mayor of Lualong, a Chinese mining city, Zhang Zhongsheng, was the first official to be given a death sentence after he was found guilty of taking US$150 million in bribes.
To date, as many as 182 000 officials have been reportedly punished for corruption and manipulation of power since President Xi came to power.
If the ruling Zanu-PF adopts such firm and unbendable steps in the fight against corruption, it will send the correct signals that graft and mismanagement of State resources will not be tolerated in Zimbabwe.
There is need for strong political will to decisively root out offenders and give deterrent sentences that will stop would-be offenders.
President Xi said: “Through a thorough review history in China and elsewhere, our party has realised that improving party contact and upholding integrity and combating corruption are vital for the survival of the party and the state.
“The key is remaining firmly reliant on the people, maintain close ties with them, and never become isolated from them. To achieve this, we must do everything in our power to address corruption and other negative phenomena, see to it that the party always identifies with the people, and shares their concerns and ultimately their destiny.
“All party members must understand the political importance of this issue, stay alert, strictly adhere to the ‘two musts’, improve our working practices, and crack down on corruption with a strong determination.”
Zanu-PF should grasp the opportunity and draw lessons from the CCP’s zero tolerance to corruption.
Therefore, drastic changes in the Zimbabwean law and legal procedures should be undertaken, otherwise the continued pussyfooting with offenders by naming and shaming them before releasing them only encourages more corruption.
In his book, President Xi outlines the tough measures his government took to restore discipline in a nation in which corruption had reached crisis proportions.
He made it clear that if the leadership is honest, citizens at all levels will be afraid to engage in corrupt activities.
President Xi pointed that it will remain part of the CCP’s political strategy to combat corruption because building a corruption-free party is at the heart of the people.
“To achieve this, we must do everything in our power to address corruption and other negative phenomena, see to it that the party always identifies itself with the people, and shares their concerns and ultimately their destiny,” he said. “We must follow the spirit of leaving a mark in the iron tools we clutch and the footprints in the stones we tread and continue to win popular trust with new victories in the fight against corruption.
“We must raise public awareness of the need to combat corruption and uphold integrity, promote a culture of clean government, and combine the rule of law with the rule of virtue.”
President Mnangagwa must borrow from the resilience of President Xi to deal with the cancer of corruption in a way that will fortify the party and the economy.
For ages, only the boldest and most daring leaders ever have had the guts to challenge corruption because the risk is too great.
It is widely perceived that fighting corruption can be disastrous to political careers because many politicians and influential people do not tolerate anyone interfering with their source of livelihood.
The Chinese government, under President Xi, made it clear that ending graft is critical for national prosperity.
These unbending measures on fighting corruption from a Chinese perspective can be highly effective if they are implemented in Zimbabwe.
What’s needed now is an effective way of rooting out corruption and graft, particularly that of top Government officials.
Should the Second Republic be serious about ending corruption, then President Xi’s stance on corruption might very well be the antidote to Africa’s corruption problems.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe']}",bribery_economic_corruption,"['Xi Jinping', 'China']","['Xi Jinping', 'China']","['China', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,2142,zimbabwesituation.com,2014-03-22T17:56:38Z,"Pay cap: Why $6,000, MPs ask Chinamasa","LEGISLATORS from Zanu PF and the MDC-T, who have led the current Parliamentary debate against corruption, have clashed over Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa’s decision to evade the august house when he decreed a blanket salary cap of $6,000 for all CEOs running State entities.
MDC-T legislator for Mbizo Settlement Chikwinya told a panel discussion at SAPES Trust Thursday evening that Chinamasa should not have rushed to unilaterally declare a cap on salaries before hearing the views of MPs.
But firebrand Zanu PF legislator for Hurungwe West, Themba Mliswa, quickly defended Chinamasa, insisting the minister was acting within his mandate adding that Parliament could only play an oversight function over his efforts.
In his remarks, Chikwinya said he had since confronted Chinamasa over his decision to sidestep the legislature which, he insisted, popularised what has now become a vibrant national debate against corruption.
“We think as Parliament, we were left out,” said Chikwinya who last week was cautioned by Parliamentary Speaker against making “unsubstantiated” claims that ZIMRA boss Gershem Pasi was earning over $300,000 per month.
“Today l confronted Minister Chinamasa who apologised to say he was of the opinion that Parliament is not sitting. He appreciates that Parliament should have been given the opportunity to, first of all debate because this is a matter which Parliament is seized with.
“ … and in respect with the Constitutional provisions, especially as alluded to in Section 119, Sub-section 2, Parliament was supposed to be given the opportunity to actually make its submissions.
“We also represent, by the way, the very same CEOs, so we were supposed to hear their concerns for us to strike a balance.”
Chikwinya further questioned the wisdom of pegging the salaries to $6,000 and demanded to know how Chinamasa had settled for that figure.
He asked: “Why $6,000? What is the justification for $6,000?”
Mliswa however, said Chinamasa was responding to an emergency and did not have the luxury to allow national coffers to “bleed” while he waited to consult Parliament.
“I think it’s pretty clear that when one is bleeding, you stop the bleeding first … so that the doctor then assesses ‘do we need to operate or not’,” he said.
“So allow the bleeding had to be stopped. But that’s not the end result because bleeding has not stopped. Those parastatals, as they are, they have collapsed. They are dysfunctional. So that move must be applauded.”
Besides their differences on Chinamasa, the two young MPs have in recent weeks earned the admiration of Zimbabweans by speaking passionately against corruption.
Chikwinya meanwhile, called on President Robert Mugabe to impose a blanket amnesty on public officials who volunteer to surrender their loot in exeicise, he said, should be akin to a truth and reconciliation commission.
He also said Mugabe must demonstrate his statesmanship by sacrificing top lieutenants who have looted the national coffers, through prosecution.
Mliswa reiterated calls he made in Parliament some two weeks ago for transport minister Obert Mpofu to be questioned on the source of funds that allowed him to buy a bank.
The Zanu PF Mashonaland West provincial chair also called on Public Service Medical Aid Society (PSMAS) board chair Luxon Zembe to relinquish his post saying he had already been tainted by being part of the team that awarded former PSMAS boss Cuthbert Dube a monthly salary of $230,000.
“Honestly, I talk about morals and values amongst our people and Luxon Zembe is not doing himself a favour,” said Mliswa.
“Here is a guy who was part of the board that sanctioned that salary but he still wants to be chairman of the board and you let him think Zimbabweans are stupid! He is somebody we respect and, with a little dignity left of him, he must step down.”",0,,,{'ZWE': ['Mashonaland West Province']},bribery_economic_corruption,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']
Zimbabwe,2410,zimbabwesituation.com,2014-05-16T17:16:26Z,Mavhaire caught in US$654m dodgy deal,"ENERGY minister Dzikamai Mavhaire is entangled in a US$654 million dodgy deal involving the Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), a subsidiary of power utility Zesa Holdings, in which the firm could be forced into huge cash outlays if a proposed controversial solar power project in which losing companies in the tendering process have been brought in via the political backdoor goes through.
Informed official sources say Mavhaire is caught up in the controversial affair in which a Chinese company, China Jiangxi Corporation (CJC), was in January this year awarded a US$183 million contract for a solar project aimed at generating 100 megawatts of electricity after a tender was floated in September last year.
The sources, however, say due to political interference ZPC was forced to bring in some companies through the political
backdoor two losing bidders, namely Intratrek Zimbabwe (Pvt) Ltd owned by Harare businessman, Wicknell Chivayo, and ZTE Corporation, without re-advertising the tender as required by law.
Chivayo is reportedly connected to the Zanu PF elite and recently held a meeting with President Robert Mugabe over undisclosed issues. He actually posted the pictures of himself and Mugabe after the meeting last year.
The shady deals will result in ZPC forking out treble its budgeted amount, as costs will balloon from U$183 million to US$366 million if all companies are to do their jobs at the rate subscribed by CJC.
Intratrek has, however, been allowed to hike its charges for the project to US$217 million amid indications other companies also plan to follow suit, which will push up the total cost of the project to US$654 million.
While the decision to increase electricity generation is laudable given the country’s power deficit which has contributed to capacity underutilisation by industry, questions are being asked as to the role played by Mavhaire in reportedly arm-twisting ZPC to award the projects to Intratrek and ZTE.
“ZPC is now saddled with three projects instead of the one that should have been constructed by CJC which won the initial tender,” said a government source, adding “the cost of the project could well balloon further should CJC and ZTE push ZPC into allowing them to implement their projects at a revised cost of US$217 million as Intratrek have been allowed to.”
The source added: “This is a scandal which involves Mavhaire and other senior government officials. To justify controversial interventions, they conveniently argued that the energy sector is a strategic matter of national security such that CJC could not be allowed to go it alone. This was an excuse to have Intratrek brought in, but how do they explain the inclusion of ZTE which is also a Chinese company?”
Mavhaire refused to comment on the issue saying “as a minister I don’t follow gossip.
“Where have you ever seen a minister handling tender issues? Why are you phoning me instead of phoning (State Procurement Board (SPB) executive chairman Charles) Kuwaza? The business of selling newspapers through writing mere gossip is very unfortunate. Thank you,” he said, before hanging up.
ZPC spokesperson Fadzai Chisveto did not respond to questions which she had requested in writing despite acknowledging receipt, while Kuwaza also did not respond to e-mailed questions.
Intratrek and ZTE were among more than 100 companies who responded to ZPC’s tender for engineering, procurement and construction of a 100 megawatt solar plant in Gwanda or Plumtree in Matabeleland South province. Despite being shortlisted, the companies eventually lost out to CJC after the SPB adjudged on January 16 that the latter had proposed a competitive bid.
Intratrek’s bid was pegged at US$248 million while that of ZTE’s was US$358 million. Sources say despite losing out in the tendering process, the two companies were given a second bite of the cherry on condition that they reduced their quotation to match the US$183 million put forward by CJC.
Official documents seen by this paper this week indicate that “political interference bordering on corruption which saw ZTE and Intratrek also being awarded similar 100MW solar power plant projects has created a huge nightmare for ZPC which is already confronted by serious financial challenges for project sponsorship”.
“Unless the three contractors are able to secure 100% self-funding, ZPC is unlikely to raise the necessary down-payments and insurance associated with loan disbursements. Thus the implementation of these projects is dependent on contractors raising 100% self-funding,” one document says.
ZPC sources say the company has earmarked 2017 as the earliest date for the completion of the solar projects, noting “2014 will only be about the completion of feasibility studies and sourcing funds”.
The matter has sucked in the SPB, with sources indicating that the board issued an 11th hour directive to stop the signing of the deal between ZPC and Chivayo’s Intratrek on April 30.
The SPB is reportedly under pressure to sanitise the deal with Intratrek by passing a resolution approving the price variation to US$217 million, according to the sources.
Chivayo said he was not at liberty to comment on “matters that are subject to on-going negotiations under the auspices of the SPB”.
“However, my understanding of solar projects,” he said, “is that they would aspire to achieve compatible tariffs given the many variables which would be in design, weather patterns, topographical conditions, output capacity of the equipment, proximity to the grid and supporting infrastructure. These are all unique to each site and will ultimately determine the final price that emanates from the negotiations.”",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Matabeleland South Province', 'Harare', 'Gwanda']}",bribery_economic_corruption,['ZTE Corporation'],['ZTE'],['Jiangxi'],"['China', 'Chinese', 'Jiangxi']"
Zimbabwe,5455,zimbabwesituation.com,2015-12-04T12:35:58Z,Wield sword on corruption,"ON 2015 New Year’s Eve — December 31 2014 to be precise — Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speech on national television was almost pitch-perfect.
Comment
Xi was in Harare this week and his speech deserves to be revisited as it showed the difference between him and his host President Robert Mugabe who was basking in the glory on his visit without embracing what his Sino friends have been doing to develop the economy and saying on reform and leadership renewal. Zimbabwe has a lot to learn from China. Highlighting continued economic growth and rising living standard in 2014, Xi said he wanted to “click the ‘like’ button”for the country’s 1,3 billion citizens, whose “support for officials at all levels” made such achievements possible.
The Chinese leader, also head of the ruling Communist party as well as the world’s largest standing army, promised deeper reforms and the rule of law in 2015, comparing them to “a bird’s two wings.” The 61-year-old leader — 30 years Mugabe’s junior — reiterated his “zero-tolerance” stance to graft, vowing to keep “waving high the sword against corruption” and “fastening the cage of regulations.”
While applauded by many ordinary citizens, Xi’s ever-wider dragnet on corruption has also attracted increasing scrutiny as some began to compare it with Mao Zedong’s use of a crackdown on the vice to achieve political agendas.
But the consensus is that Xi is doing to the right thing. He has done in three years what Mugabe has failed to do in 35 years, not just on running the economy but also combating corruption. Xi’s unprecedented anti-corruption campaign is targeting party, government, military and state-owned company officials suspected of corruption after he came to power in late 2012.
The Communist Party’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, headed by Politburo Standing Committee member and key Xi ally Wang Qishan, has played a central role in this campaign, in which hundreds of officials across the nation have been investigated and prosecuted. This has seen Xi break powerful cliques involving an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons as well as billions of dollars worth of deals and bribes. He took down former domestic security czar Zhou Yongkang; General Xu Caihou, once the military’s second-in-command; and Ling Jihua, a top aide to ex-President Hu Jintao. Chinese state media have touted them as the three biggest “tigers” caught in Xi’s anti-graft campaign, with a stated goal of targeting both “tigers and flies” — high and low-ranking officials. He also arrested a number of other to officials, including Jiang Jiemin and Bo Xilai.
In Zimbabwe, Mugabe and his ministers have been making anti-corruption noises and putting structures to combat the vice, but the trouble has been lack of political will and failure to tackle corrupt elements right at the top echelons of power. The problem here is that the system is largely corrupt to the core and its leaders are main drivers of corruption. They are at the forefront of rent-seeking and stealing. Actually corruption has of late been intensifying in government. It’s now like official policy. As Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa has said before if the fight against corruption is to succeed, Zimbabwe must be ruthless in fighting it like China. No one must be untouchable. Mugabe must take the lead, but can he really do that?",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",bribery_economic_corruption,['Xi Jinping'],"['Xi Jinping', 'Wang Qishan']","['Wang Qishan', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Wang Qishan']"
Zimbabwe,11119,zimbabwesituation.com,2019-12-12T00:00:03Z,Will China ever tire of Zimbabwe’s corruption and bad debt?,"Meanwhile, both China and Zimbabwe have denied media reports that Chinese financiers had suspended US$1.3 billion in lending to three key projects after the Mnangagwa government diverted US$10 million from an escrow account for the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport expansion project as the country was hit by an acute shortage of foreign currency.
Zhao Baogang, China’s deputy ambassador to Zimbabwe, wrote on Twitter that “China supports efforts by the Zimbabwe government and the 1 Not found any post projects are now being implemented in line with the plan”. projects are now being implemented in line with the plan”.
When asked if the US$10 million taken from the airport expansion project account had been returned, Zhao said it had not.
George Guvamatanga, secretary of Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, said the Zimbabwean government met a delegation from China Eximbank in October to review current and future projects.
“All current projects are continuing,” he said. When pressed on the more than US$10 million that is alleged to have been withdrawn from an escrow account, Guvamatanga said all the escrow funds were still in the account of an independent bank.
“You can visit the RGM [Robert Gabriel Mugabe] Airport and Hwange Power Station and you will see that those projects are continuing,” he said on Twitter account, adding that the escrow accounts were not held at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe or a government-owned bank.
China is also backing Zimbabwe’s call for the US and European Union to remove their sanctions on the country, which is battling high inflation and an acute shortage of foreign currency.
Obert Hodzi, a Zimbabwean researcher and international relations scholar at the University of Liverpool in England, said because of the economic crisis in Zimbabwe, Chinese investments had not performed as well as expected.
Professor Martin Rupiya, head of innovation and training at the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes in Durban, South Africa, said there was no dilemma in the relationship between Beijing and Harare, and that China’s position as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council had been a plus for developing nations.
The former army general said China had advanced Zimbabwe various loans and support to help offset the impact of the EU and US sanctions.
The mistake the Zimbabwean leadership had made was to “assume the loans are an extension or expression of China’s foreign policy and therefore neglecting to pay up on what Beijing sees as a commercial investment”, Rupiya said.
Thousands gather in Zimbabwe for Mugabe’s funeral
Beijing extended US$2.2 billion worth of loans to Zimbabwe between 2000 and 2017, according to the China Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, but Harare has been in default since the country fell into recession.
Hodzi said China saw the foreign sanctions as interference in the internal affairs of another state and so by supporting Zimbabwe was sending a message that it would not tolerate such meddling in places like Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet.
Dr Chipo Dendere, assistant professor of political science in Africana studies at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, said that Sino-Zimbabwe relations were historical, “so that plays a big role in how the two countries engage”.
The Zimbabwe-born scholar said the shared ideology and historical ties made it difficult for either country to just walk away. But “China is not blind to the core of Zimbabwe’s problems which are corruption”, she said.
“China’s dilemma on one hand is the friendship and the desire to get access to resources [in Zimbabwe] and on the other is the reality that Zimbabwe’s elite are deeply corrupt.

Zimbabwe,6232,zimbabwesituation.com,2016-05-20T11:46:23Z,Dodgy deals inflated $507m,"ZIMBABWE’s controversial power generation projects have been inflated by more than US$500 million raising suspicion that Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (Zesa) managers and senior government officials could have corruptly benefitted through price escalations, the Zimbabwe Independent has learnt.
Elias Mambo/Herbert Moyo
Official sources say the price escalations and government’s inability or unwillingness to investigate the corrupt deals suggest ministers supervising the tenders and contracts, working with the State Procurement Board, are deeply involved in the attendant costly corruption.
Zesa is rocked by a massive tender scandals in which government has entrusted the country’s critical multi-billion-dollar energy projects to dodgy businessmen who have criminal records, ranging from fraud to drug trafficking.
Zimbabwe is planning to construct three solar plants, each generating 100 megawatts. The initial cost, as of 2014, was US$183 million for each of the projects bringing the total cost to US$549 million.
The solar tenders were won by China Jiangxi Corporation (CJC), ZTE Corporation and Intratrek Zimbabwe (Pvt) Ltd owned by Harare businessman Wicknell Chivayo.
Soon after winning the tenders, the companies demanded price escalations, resulting in the projects being pegged at US$240 million each, bringing the total costs to US$720 million. This meant a variation of US$171 million from the initial costs.
Government officials told the Independent this week the country initially planned to have one, 100MW project, which was won by CJC, but for unexplained reasons, Intratrek and ZTE, who had lost in the initial bids, were also awarded tenders.
Zimbabwe is also working on the Kariba South Power Expansion project and the Gairezi Hydro Project. Former Energy minister Elton Mangoma who negotiated the deals a few years back this week revealed the projects costs were also heavily inflated.
Mangoma said the inflation of costs was clearly done to cater for bribery and kickbacks for corrupt officials.
The Gairezi Project was awarded to a consortium led by Chivhayo’s Intratek. Mangoma said the Gairezi project cost had shot up to US$248 million, up from the initial US$90 million. This created a variance of US$158 million.
The Kariba South Power Extension project, which was officially commissioned by President Robert Mugabe in September 2014, was initially pegged at US$355 million, but shot up to US$533 million. The cost escalation was US$178 million.
The inflated costs in total amount to US$507 million.
Mangoma told Independent this week that the terms for the projects had also been altered, massively prejudicing Zesa.
“Kariba South was initially pegged at US$355 million of which Zimbabwe Power Company was supposed to fund between US$55 million to US$60 million and the balance was to be paid from a Chinese Exim bank loan,” Mangoma said. “The cost included a 10% contingency plan, so there is no way the cost could escalate to more than US$500 million within a three year period.
“I have no doubt that the escalation of the costs is meant to cater for the corrupt government officials because feasibility studies were done and there is absolutely no reason for the costs to soar.”
Mangoma added: “The Gairezi Hydro Power Station was initially pegged at US$90 million and now we hear the cost has risen to US$248 million. So basically it means the costs of the projects have ballooned to astronomical figures in the last three years”.
The costs for the solar projects were adjusted in 2014 when former Energy minister Dzikamai Mavhaire was at the helm of the ministry. The prices were escalated despite some experts in ZPC arguing it would make more economic sense to fund reputable alternatives, including the Hwange Thermal project which required US$400 million to produce an additional 300 megawatts.
The solar projects at current costs require US$720 million to generate 300MW, meaning ZPC could have saved US$320 million.
A Ministry of Energy official said: “Solar will require much more money to produce and there may well be a lot more unseen additional costs.
“Also important to note is the fact that the electricity will only be produced during daytime. There are fears that the scheme is simply being pushed through to create another feeding trough for politically-connected individuals to siphon more money from an already cash-strapped government.”
Former Finance minister Tendai Biti, who also took part in the negotiations for the projects, previously raised a red flag over the Kariba South project, citing the comparative costs of a similar project being done in Zambia.
“Zambia is expanding its power-generation capacity at Kariba Dam, which it shares with Zimbabwe, at a cost of US$278 million,” he said. Biti also said that although more work needed to be done on the Zimbabwean side of the dam than on the Zambian side, the cost should not have escalated that much.
“I went to China to negotiate … We want the project, but not corruption. There is no justification for the increased cost,” he said.
However, Energy minister Samuel Undenge said the costs were arrived at by the technical team which is responsible for assessing the projects.
“I have repeatedly said that ministers are given reports from those doing the technical issues in the ministry. We have engineers and financial directors who go through these things and submit to us. Our role is on policy implementation only,” he said.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZMB': ['Kariba Dam']}",bribery_economic_corruption,['ZTE Corporation'],['ZTE'],['Jiangxi'],['Jiangxi']
Zimbabwe,10518,zimbabwesituation.com,2019-05-04T17:24:27Z,We must emulate China's anti-corruption strategies,"Obert Gutu 4 May 2019
In fact, corruption is so deeply embedded in all facets of our life be it
political, religious, business, social etc. Corruption is like a malignant
cancer rapturing and tearing apart the very fabric of our existence as a
nation.
Corruption is the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. It can be
classified as grand, petty and political, depending on the amounts of
money lost and the sector where it occurs.
From your small-time illegal foreign currency dealer on the street corner,
to your vacuous and vapid but extremely powerful and well-connected
politician in the ruling party or even within opposition political
parties, corruption is widely being practised in Zimbabwe.
It has now become a national curse, a sordid and deprecating badge of
shame and dishonour.
Corruption is stinking to high heavens. Unless and until we adopt and
implement effective measures and strategies to identify, clamp down and
eventually reduce or even eliminate corruption, Zimbabwe’s national
economy will continue to tank and in the process, causing massive public
disaffection, disharmony and discontent.
Put simply, corruption in Zimbabwe has now effectively degenerated into
becoming a very serious and alarming national security threat.
Business cartels and monopolistic and greedy but insipidly corrupt
informal networks have since sprouted within the private sector to such an
extent that the prevailing unrealistic and random increase in the prices
of basic goods and services can easily be linked to the emergence of these
corrupt but extremely powerful business cartels. Something surely has got
to give.
We cannot continue on this ruinous and self-destruct route that is causing
untold misery and suffering to the majority of Zimbabweans.
In one of my recent opinion pieces, I boldly stated that I always speak
truth to power and as such, I am not going to spare the blame that also
involves very senior government officials and top-notch business
executives in the private sector.
We have got absolutely no other viable option but to be ruthless and
uncompromising when it comes to dealing with and thwarting corruption or
else the much publicised government’s anti-corruption onslaught will be
nothing but an embarrassing and humiliating flop.
Thus, we shouldn’t only denounce corruption in word; we should also be
seen to be effectively uprooting the cancer of corruption within our midst
and in the process, firing corrupt public officials and also ensuring that
the full wrath of the law descends upon all corrupt officials in both the
public and private sectors.
Let us learn from and indeed, emulate other countries that are apparently
succeeding in fighting graft.
A far-reaching campaign against corruption began in China following the
conclusion of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
in 2012.
The anti-corruption campaign under Chinese President Xi Jinping has since
gone a gear up and a significant number of senior public officials have
been caught and dealt with in the anti-corruption dragnet.
This anti-corruption onslaught was arguably the largest anti-graft effort
in the history of Communist rule in China.
President Xi Jinping, upon taking office, vowed to crack down on “tigers
and flies”, that is, high-level officials and local civil servants alike.
As of 2016, the campaign has “netted” over 120 high-ranking officials,
including about a dozen high-ranking military officers, several senior
executives of State-owned companies, and five national leaders.
More than 100 000 people have been indicted for corruption.
The campaign is part of a much wider drive to clean up malfeasance within
the Chinese Communist Party and shore up party unity.
It has become the emblematic feature of President Xi Jinping’s political
brand.
Nearer home on the African continent, Rwanda and Cape Verde are the
leading African countries in the war against corruption.
They tied at position 48 out of 180 nations with 55 points, in the
Transparency International’s report of 2017 rankings. Zimbabwe is located
way down the perking order. We have got to pull up our socks and deal the
cancer of corruption a ruthless sucker punch.
Rwanda is often touted as an example of what African countries could
achieve if only they were better governed.
Out of the ashes of a horrific genocide that killed about 800 000 Tutsis
and moderate Hutus in a short 100 days in 1994, President Paul Kagame has
resuscitated the economy, curtailed corruption and maintained political
stability.
Of course, some critics have argued that Kagame has sacrificed basic human
rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of association to sustain
the ruling party’s political hegemony.
But there is absolutely no denying that Rwanda is one of Africa’s
economic success stories.
Going forward, we expect heads to roll as the anti-corruption onslaught
gathers momentum in Zimbabwe. Failure is not an option and defeat is not
on the agenda.

Zimbabwe,9678,zimlive.com,2018-07-18T16:21:11Z,China is no model to copy: Obama warns,"JOHANNESBURG – AFRICAN countries must shun China’s model of “authoritarian control combined with mercantilist capitalism”, former United States President Barack Obama has warned.
Delivering the Nelson Mandela lecture in Johannesburg on Tuesday, Obama said Africans must embrace democracy as the only model to advance their economic interests as well as individual rights and freedoms.
“Strongman politics are ascendant suddenly, whereby elections and some pretence of democracy are maintained — the form of it — but those in power seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning,” Obama said.
In the audience sat Nkosana Moyo, a presidential candidate for Zimbabwe’s July 30 elections.
After a military takeover in November last year which ousted former President Robert Mugabe, his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa has tried to steer Zimbabwe towards the Chinese model – emphasising economic development over civil liberties and strong independent institutions.
Said Obama: “Many developing countries now are looking at China’s model of authoritarian control combined with mercantilist capitalism as preferable to the messiness of democracy. Who needs free speech as long as the economy is going good?
“The free press is under attack. Censorship and state control of media is on the rise. Social media — once seen as a mechanism to promote knowledge and understanding and solidarity — has proved to be just as effective promoting hatred and paranoia and propaganda and conspiracy theories.
“So on Madiba’s 100th birthday, we now stand at a crossroads — a moment in time at which two very different visions of humanity’s future compete for the hearts and the minds of citizens around the world. Two different stories, two different narratives about who we are and who we should be. How should we respond?”
Nelson Mandela understood that “democracy is based on the majority principle. At the same time, democracy also requires the rights of political and other minorities be safeguarded.”
He added: “He understood it’s not just about who has the most votes. It’s also about the civic culture that we build that makes democracy work.
“We have to stop pretending that countries that just hold an election where sometimes the winner somehow magically gets 90 percent of the vote because all the opposition are locked up or can’t get on TV is a democracy.
“Democracy depends on strong institutions and it’s about minority rights and checks and balances; freedom of speech and freedom of expression and a free press; and a right to protest and petition the government; an independent judiciary and everybody having to follow the law.”
Conceding that democracy “can be messy”, Obama insisted that “it is the only form of government that has the possibility of making that idea real.”
“Yes, democracy can be messy, and it can be slow, and it can be frustrating. I know, I promise. But the efficiency that’s offered by an autocrat, that’s a false promise. Don’t take that one, because it leads invariably to more consolidation of wealth at the top and power at the top, and it makes it easier to conceal corruption and abuse. For all its imperfections, real democracy best upholds the idea that government exists to serve the individual and not the other way around.”
Obama’s speech would have been closely watched across the border to the north in Zimbabwe, where the Zanu PF government has refused the opposition access to state media with threats to crack down on social media ahead of a vote on July 30.

The Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition has never, is not and has no plans of becoming a terrorist organisation, and will always use peace and dialogue as the only means to a sustainable solution to the Zimbabwean crisis.
The baseless statements by Mr Chinamasa are meant to silence the critical voices against corruption and bad governance. Even though these statements are outright nonsensical they serve as a reminder to many of us in the pro-democracy movement of ZANU PF’s default mode. All pretence about a new era and the second republic rhetoric has become hollow words.
The unfortunate statements by the ZANU PF Politburo member are a ridicule to the ethos of the liberation struggle and only synonymous to that of former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith’s venom, taken from the apartheid and colonial handbooks. The late nationalists’ Herbert Chitepo, Ndabaningi Sithole, Joshua Nkomo should be turning in their graves.
We are particularly petrified by the incitement of violence. Mr Chinamasa urged ZANU PF supporters to “use any means at your disposal to defend yourselves.” He went further to say: “They (31 July demonstrators) must know that when they are being attacked, law enforcement agents might not be near.”
Such reckless utterances should not be taken lightly given ZANU PF’s violent history as narrated at the Motlanthe commission after the 1 August 2018 state murders of 6 unarmed civilians.
There is an apparent attempt by the State to silence dissenting voices through arbitrary arrests, beatings, abductions and threatening civil society leaders and trade unionists. The media, particularly the state – controlled media continues to be partial while perpetuating divisions in society and brazenly attacking civil society as plotting to subvert Zimbabwe’s constitutional democracy.
Addressing the Zimbabwean crisis implies addressing the concerns of the ordinary citizens who have had to bear the brutal effects of an economic meltdown stemming from a constitutional and legitimacy crisis.
Government needs to honour its social protection obligations and this is achievable through wide consultations hence the need for an inclusive process.
The Coalition calls for the immediate arrest of Patrick Chinamasa for inciting violence and urging ZANU PF supporters to take the law into their own hands thus Contravening Section 187 (1) (a) as read with section 37 (1) (a) of the Criminal Law [Cordification and Reform] Act, Chapter 9:23, “incitement to participate in public violence’’. The role of protecting the lives and property of the people is the sole responsibility of the Police Service as clearly articulated by Section 219 of the country’s constitution.
Therefore, we appeal to the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission and the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission to call Mr Chinamasa to order and demand a retraction of those inflammatory statements which have a potential of fomenting violence and hatred amongst citizens.
We urge SADC and the African Union (AU) to closely monitor the developments in Zimbabwe and ACT, as these utterances show a state gearing up to slaughter its people given the past experiences. We are thus reminded of the old adage, that, “when a hyena wants to eat its children it accuses them of smelling like goats.”
On our part as Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, we have set our minimum demands for the national dialogue process based on wider consultations with our membership around the country.
Thus, it is our conviction that the national dialogue process must involve all stakeholders and a national visioning process that has civil society, government, political parties, business, religious groups and labour unions among other critical stakeholders.

It is cardinal postulate of international diplomacy that there is One China and Taiwan is an integral part of mainland China. The One China principle is also the basis upon which the Beijing-Washinton interaction rests.“Efforts, conduct and behaviour that offends the One China principle will inevitably lead to tension and may even cause conflict between the two leading economies of the world. The visit of Pelosi risks igniting military conflict by forcing Beijing to assert its rightful rights and authority over Taipei. We call upon Washington to be true and honest to the One China principle and desist from brewing  needless tension through stoking and fanning separatist tendencies on the island of Taiwan,” said Cde Mutsvangwa.The visit to Taiwan by Pelosi has been roundly condemned across the world and Cde Mutsvangwa said Zimbabwe as a long time ally of China strongly opposes any violation of the One China principle.“Zimbabwe, a long time friend stands by Beijing in recognising one China. Harare firmly opposes an actions and attempts to revise this policy in any form of State interaction. Speaker Nancy Pelosi should desist from hiding behind the cloak of false democratic excuses as she tramples upon China’s quest for indisoluble unity of the people and territory of Taiwan with the 1,4 billion on mainland China.”He added that the ruling party stands steadfastly with its sisterly revolutionary party, the Communist Party of China.“Zanu PF is in steady solidarity with its sister Party the Communist Party of China in this brazen act of intrusion and provocation by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her misguided visit to Taipei. It behoves the US to behave as a responsible superpower on the global stage. It is undesirable that the world is needlessly brought to the precipice of suicidal nuclear conflagration. The reckless pursuit of hegemony in multicolour and diverse will never bent to the unbridled command of Washington,” said Cde Mutsvangwa.“The ‘One China’ policy is the basis of Sino-US relations. As per this agreement, signed in 1979, Washington established formal ties with China rather than the island of Taiwan, however the visit by Ms Pelosi is in direct violation of that principle, triggering tension between the US and China,” he said.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Washington'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan', 'Taipei'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare']}",diplomatic_statement,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Beijing']"

Lloyd Gumbo in BEIJING, China
President Mugabe yesterday met African diplomats based here, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Speaker of the National People’s Congress, Zhang Dejiang in separate meetings, where they described him as an African statesman who stood up to challenge the West despite the imposition of sanctions on the country.Zimbabwe’s ambassador to China, Cde Fredrick Shava, said it had become a tradition for African diplomats to meet Heads of State visiting China on state visits.
Ambassadors took turns to praise President Mugabe after he addressed them on the developments in Zimbabwe, Africa and his visit to China.
Sierra Leone ambassador, Mr Victor Bockarie, was the first to heap praises on President Mugabe.
“You are a man we admire in our part of Africa. You are indeed a true son of Africa. You are standing the test of our former colonial bosses on the issue of land… Thank you for your endurance even if sanctions have been put on your doorstep,” said Ambassador Bockarie.
He implored President Mugabe to raise the threat of Ebola on the continent at the forthcoming African Union Summit.
Liberia’s ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Mr Mckniley Thomas, chipped in: “We are also great admirers of His Excellency, the President, a great son of Africa.”
A Nigerian representative praised President Mugabe for being the only leader who had told white people to back off.
In his remarks, President Mugabe said it was important for Africa to unite against imperialists.
He chronicled the bilateral dispute between Harare and London saying it arose after the country redistributed land to the landless majority.
He reiterated that it was important for Africans to add value to their natural resources in order for them to realise full benefits from the same.
President Mugabe said there was need for adequate infrastructure for the continent to fully industrialise.
He said Africa expected South Africa to take the lead in the industrialisation process of other African states, but to no avail since the economy in that country was still under white control.
President Mugabe said other countries on the continent would be patient with South Africa to address the skewed ownership of resources for the whole continent to benefit.
He said it was important for countries to merge businesses if they were similar so that they could improve their performance.
He blasted the West for killing former Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi under the guise of protecting civilians.
That country, he said had remained ungovernable while at the same time bemoaning problems bedevilling South Sudan where authorities in that country were on each other’s throat.
Premier Keqiang said the Sino-Zimbabwe relations had continued to grow because of mutual respect between the two countries.
“Our two countries have always grown our relationship on the basis of mutual respect and equality and I believe that this visit by you to China this time will be further impetus to the growth of our bilateral ties,” he said.
President Mugabe said: “We came on a State visit which we hoped as it was going to be accompanied by a programme to discuss cooperation and therefore we hoped would produce for us the necessary aid assistance from China that we need in order for us to boost our economy, to get the various sectors of our economy moving even as they are suffering from the burden of illegal sanctions imposed by Britain, Europe and America. And some discussions have taken place already.”
Mr Dejiang also praised President Mugabe for being a statesman.
“Mr President, you are a great leader of Zimbabwe and you are also one of the great champions in Africa. For a very long time you have made very important and significant contributions to the independence and development of Zimbabwe and the independence and liberation of Africa and I would like to pay tribute to you for your contribution,” he said.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa', 'Europe'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa'], 'SDN': ['Republic of the Sudan'], 'GBR': ['United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland', 'London'], 'USA': ['United States', 'West']}",diplomatic_statement,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,10258,herald.co.zw,2019-03-24T00:00:00Z,JUST IN : Chinese hits back at Mliswa,"Herald Reporter
The Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe has expressed disquiet over comments by Norton legislator, Mr Temba Mliswa over Zimbabwe-China relations.
Mr Mliswa appeared to suggest that the cooperation between Harare and Beijing – a historical tie dating back to the national liberation struggle in Zimbabwe – was not beneficial to the latter in light of its economic challenges.
Mr Mliswa has also been at war with Chinese company, Sunny Yi Feng Tiles factory which has a plant in Norton, some 40 kilometres West of Harare.
Below is the full statement, issued by the Embassy last night:
Recently, Temba P. Mliswa, the MP of Norton, has made a series of accusations against the Sunny Yi Feng Tiles Factory (Zimbabwe), a project by a Chinese company in Zimbabwe. The Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe attaches importance to this and hereby makes the following statement:
The Chinese government, in accordance with the laws and regulations, protects the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese enterprises and citizens. And at the same time, the Government always requires them to abide by the laws and regulations of the host countries and respect local customs.
The Chinese embassy attaches importance to MP Mliswa’s criticisms and proposals concerning the tiles factory and has since coordinated the two sides to solve the problem through dialogue and consultation on several occasions. With the facilitation of the Chinese embassy, the dialogue between the two sides is still going on and we expect it to produce positive results. If the relevant issues cannot be resolved through consultation, the two sides may settle them rationally through legal channels.
The Chinese embassy has also noted with serious concerns some remarks made by MP Mliswa concerning China-Zimbabwe cooperation. Mainly two points are: 1.If Chinese investment is so good for Zim, why is the Zimbabwean economy still struggling? 2. During the construction of the new Parly building, mineral extraction is the order of the day.
The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe solemnly makes the statements as follows in response:
To do its utmost to help Zimbabwe and its people is China’s foreign policy towards Zimbabwe. In recent years, The Victoria Falls Airport Expansion Project, the Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project, the Kariba South Hydro-power Station Expansion Project, the Hwange Power Station Expansion Project and so on, which have been or are being built with concessional loans from China, have played an important role in improving infrastructure and self-sustaining capacity for the economic and social development of Zimbabwe. The projects involve more than $2 billion.
A few days ago, China decided to provide another new batch of grant of 400 million RMB (58 million US dollars) to Zimbabwe to help the country complete post-cyclone reconstruction and other important projects. It is not only logically absurd, but also morally untenable to simply blame that Zimbabwe’s economic difficulty can be attributed to that China’s investment is not good for Zimbabwe. It is universally recognized that whether a country can get rid of poverty and achieve sustainable development mainly relies on its own efforts.
The New Parliament Project is a project financed by the grant from the Chinese government. It does not have any attached project, nor does it spend a single penny from the Zimbabwean government’s coffer. This project is a manifestation of the profound friendship between the two governments and the peoples of China and Zimbabwe and brooks no one’s smear or distorting.
China and Zimbabwe enjoy a profound traditional friendship. The two sides have always rendered each other strong support on issues concerning each other’s core interests. China-Zimbabwe relations will not be affected by slander or vilifying by any individual. The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe is firmly opposed to the move by certain individual or media to undermine the friendship and cooperation between the two countries through flinging abuses, fabricating rumors and malicious slander. This does no good to Zimbabwe’s own development. We sincerely hope that the Zimbabwean side will continue to create a more favorable environment for all foreign direct investment, including Chinese enterprises.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare', 'Norton', 'Victoria Falls Airport'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing']}",diplomatic_statement,"['Chinese', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Chinese']","['Chinese', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Zimbabwe,8062,zimbabwesituation.com,2017-06-19T07:32:37Z,Mugabe lashes out at Chinese,"PRESIDENT Robert Mugabe has lashed out at his “all-weather friends” — the Chinese — for allegedly using him to hoodwink the people of Manicaland province into believing they would benefit from proceeds of Chiadzwa’s Marange diamonds.
BY RICHARD CHIDZA/KENNETH NYANGANI
Addressing thousands of Zanu PF supporters in Mutare on Friday, Mugabe admitted he was made to “wave dummy cheques” by Chinese diamond miners who pledged $10 million to develop communities affected by mining activities.
“You have grievances as people of Manicaland and we are aware of that. We know that you had expected money to be deposited in the Community Share Ownership Scheme like what happened in Zvimba (Mugabe’s home area), but it never came. The Chinese used us and that is why we kicked them out,” Mugabe said.
Two Chinese firms — Anjin and Jinan — were among five diamond miners licensed to extract the mineral from Chiadzwa before government withdrew their operating licences last year following reports of massive leakages and smuggling of the gems out of the country.
The Chinese firms operating in the Marange area promised to plough back over $10 million towards the Community Share Ownership Scheme, but reportedly reneged on their pledge.
“Even me, an old man, I feel used. They made me walk around waving dummy cheques, yet they never fulfilled the promise they gave. We then had a misunderstanding with the Chinese and we kicked them out along with the South Africans and the Lebanese. They lied to me, but we will not forget the people of Manicaland,” Mugabe said.
First Lady Grace Mugabe is currently locked in a bitter legal battle with a Lebanese gem dealer after a $1,4 million ring deal went awry.
Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere, who served as Indigenisation minister at the time of the share ownership schemes, was implicated in the scam.
Government last year took over all diamond mining activities and established the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC).
Mugabe said court challenges by the Chinese had slowed down government’s plans.
“They went to court, but lost. This has slowed us down, but I can assure you that once we are mining and selling our diamonds, we will fulfil the promise made, not by government, but by the Chinese,” the President said.
Mugabe, for years, has harped on the so-called “Look East Policy”, mainly aimed at wooing Chinese companies to prop up his beleaguered regime with little success.
In the past two years, the Zanu PF leader has signed a litany of memoranda of understanding with a number of Chinese companies — dubbed the mega deals — but little has come in the form of operationalisation, amid reports that the Chinese were waiting in the wings to do business with Mugabe’s successor.
The Chinese were reportedly holding out for Mugabe to hand-over power to Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa.
Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans’ Association leader and former Cabinet minister Christopher Mutsvagwa last year admitted meeting the Chinese, in which discussions over Mugabe’s age were raised.
“In the course of discussing investments in Zimbabwe, the Chinese asked about political risk given the President’s age. They (Chinese) drew parallels to a retirement age father applying for a mortgage loan. The bank manager will ask for the working age son to co-sign so as to address life risk. The State House in Harare received that report and laced it with a nefarious twist to President Mugabe,” Mutsvangwa said last year.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Manicaland Province', 'Mutare', 'Harare', 'Zvimba District'], 'CHN': ['Jinan', 'Anjin']}",diplomatic_statement,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese']

All pretence about a new era and the second republic rhetoric has become hollow words.The unfortunate statements by the ZANU PF Politburo member are a ridicule to the ethos of the liberation struggle and only synonymous to that of former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith’s venom, taken from the apartheid and colonial handbooks. The late nationalists’ Herbert Chitepo, Ndabaningi Sithole, Joshua Nkomo should be turning in their graves.We are particularly petrified by the incitement of violence. Mr Chinamasa urged ZANU PF supporters to  “use any means at your disposal to defend yourselves.” He went further to say: “They (31 July demonstrators) must know that when they are being attacked, law enforcement agents might not be near.”Such reckless utterances should not be taken lightly given ZANU PF’s violent history as narrated at the Motlanthe commission after the 1 August 2018 state murders of 6 unarmed civilians.There is an apparent attempt by the State to silence dissenting voices through arbitrary arrests, beatings, abductions and threatening civil society leaders and trade unionists. The media, particularly the state – controlled media continues to be partial while perpetuating divisions in society and brazenly attacking civil society as plotting to subvert Zimbabwe’s constitutional democracy.Addressing the Zimbabwean crisis implies addressing the concerns of the ordinary citizens who have had to bear the brutal effects of an economic meltdown stemming from a constitutional and legitimacy crisis.Government needs to honour its social protection obligations and this is achievable through wide consultations hence the need for an inclusive process.The Coalition calls for the immediate arrest of Patrick Chinamasa for inciting violence and urging ZANU PF supporters to take the law into their own hands thus Contravening Section 187 (1) (a) as read with section 37 (1) (a) of the Criminal Law [Cordification and Reform] Act, Chapter 9:23, “incitement to participate in public violence’’.  The role of protecting the lives and property of the people is the sole responsibility of the Police Service as clearly articulated by Section 219 of the country’s constitution.Therefore, we appeal to the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission and the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission to call Mr Chinamasa to order and demand a retraction of those inflammatory statements which have a potential of fomenting violence and hatred amongst citizens.We urge SADC and the African Union (AU)  to closely monitor the developments in Zimbabwe and ACT, as these utterances show a state gearing up to slaughter its people given the past experiences. We are thus reminded of the old adage, that,  “when a hyena wants to eat its children it accuses them of smelling like goats.”On our part as Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, we have set our minimum demands for the national dialogue process based on wider consultations with our membership around the country.Thus, it is our conviction that the national dialogue process must involve all stakeholders and a national visioning process that has civil society, government, political parties, business, religious groups and labour unions among other critical stakeholders.The dialogue process should produce a clearly timed roadmap to the demilitarization of civilian political processes and the restoration of normalcy by focusing on key political, economic and social reforms.

by VENERANDA LANGA
This was brought up by Harare residents yesterday during public hearings on the NPRC Bill being held by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Justice, and thematic committees on Peace and Security and on Human rights.
According to the Constitution, the NPRC has a 10-year lifespan which dates back to 2013.
“Government, through Mugabe and Chinamasa, must apologise to the nation for failing to appoint the NPRC and avail money because three years of its 10-year lifespan have been wasted and yet there have been several cases of politically-motivated violence,” Obert Matsika of Chitungwiza said.
Participants also demanded that the clause which stipulates that Mugabe appoints the commission be removed as this could result in political appointees.
Others demanded the National Peace and Reconciliation minister should not be a member of a political party.
They said the NPRC should be run by churches.
Different people demanded the NPRC Bill, which is currently in the Second Reading Stage in the National Assembly, should include clauses banning political slogans that promote hate speech.
Other participants suggested the Bill must have clauses that stipulate action which the commission will take to curb future electoral violence, as well as clauses on how the NPRC will engage in dialogue with different political parties to discourage violence.
They said the Bill must be explicit on how to deal with the securocrats threatening, intimidating and announcing their political allegiance during election periods, including partisan traditional chiefs and headmen who intimidate voters, saying they were fuelling conflict.
Clayton Manjova of Heal Zimbabwe Trust said the Bill seemed to criminalise victims who will give evidence by mentioning issues of falsehoods.
“Rather there should be criminalisation of the perpetrators. There should be publication of the findings after, and not before, investigations so that the perpetrators do not tamper with evidence,” he said.
A development consultant, Cynthia Mawema, said the Bill should consider the role of the media in peace building and in instigating violence, taking into cognisance what happened during the Rwanda genocide.
Trade unionist Rita Nyamupinga said the NPRC Bill must be explicit on protection of employees and ensure the judiciary would act fairly in passing judgments.
A Bindura University student, Tatenda Gwaradza, said the Bill should consider traditional leaders in the national healing process as they can offer traditional methods of
healing.

Zimbabwe,8146,newsday.co.zw,2017-07-26T00:00:00Z,Chinamasa’s thoughtless gibe an insult to us,"Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa’s utterances that the government was content with the liquidity situation in the country is heartbreaking and shows top government officials are living in cloud cuckooland while the poor majority continue to wallow in abject poverty.
Comment: NewsDay Editor
The fact that Chinamasa could claim, with a straight face that cash shortages are a mirage, clearly demonstrates that it’s either government officials are out of touch with the reality on the ground or they have opted to be economical with the truth.
What is tragic, however, is that at a time when the liquidity situation has become so bad that most banks are giving out a handful pieces of silver, as all the notes seem to have disappeared, Chinamasa has the guts to taunt the suffering citizens. He even has the audacity to convince meek Zimbabweans that all is well as far as money circulation is concerned.
This simply demonstrates that the Zanu PF regime has become so clueless as to how to resolve this latest crisis and its officials have either opted to live in a world of make-belief or they believe that Zimbabweans are just a foolish lot with no reasoning capacity and will, therefore, take whatever they say.
Chinamasa’s remarks are regrettable and in bad taste given Zimbabweans have always meekly allowed the Zanu PF hegemony to continue to the detriment of the economy and social fabric.
Perhaps, it is time for Zimbabweans to stand up against misgovernance, political patronage, graft and milking of State resources by the Zanu PF elites.
There is no doubt that the fact that money is not circulating as it should is an indication that there is a serious economic problem. His claims that the government was working hard to address the movement of money through normal banking channels will likely have few takers because this crisis has been going on for so long and nothing significant has been done to bring reprieve to the country.
Many business hours are lost with people waiting in bank queues for cash that may never come. Most Zimbabweans have been spending much of their time in bank queues struggling to access their cash amid complaints from business that this has had a negative impact on production.
It has become the norm that the government only reacts to problems instead of being proactive. Economic projections should give them an indication of where we are headed as a country economically so that they become proactive. It has become a tradition in this country that politicians just talk without walking the talk.
The huge lesson from Chinamasa’s thoughtless joke is that until and unless the majority put a stop to this nonsense, Zimbabwe will continue to disintegrate.

Zimbabwe,11708,chronicle.co.zw,2020-07-22T00:42:46Z,President salutes China: Thanks Zim’s all-weather friend for help during Covid-19 pandemic,"Joseph Madzimure, Harare Bureau
President Mnangagwa has saluted Zimbabwe’s all-weather friend China for standing with the country through the trying times brought by the novel Covid-19 pandemic.
Yesterday President Mnangagwa received 30 000 testing kits donated by the Chinese Government including 220 000 surgical masks and 40 000 medical gloves among other personnel protective equipment (PPEs) that were donated by the International Department of Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the ruling party Zanu PF.
President Mnangagwa warned Zimbabweans to guard against complacency.
“The pandemic knows no borders, the pandemic knows no colour; the pandemic knows no level of economic development (and) the pandemic knows no level of health infrastructure. It has ravaged many countries on the globe. When we look at the manner in which it has caused havoc in the First World countries like America, Germany, United Kingdom, we in flagging economies, we really feel naked to deal with this pandemic.
“We, however, are grateful that our friends… our relationship with the People’s Republic of China that is historical and has stood the test of time has come to our rescue. You have sent us equipment from the time the pandemic reached this country. You have sent us medical experts to come and share their experiences and competences with our people and our medical doctors here.”
The President said donations from China were a testimony of an enduring friendship that dates back to the country’s liberation struggle.
“We shall remain grateful for that. Today, we are receiving this consignment coming from our sister party, the Communist Party of China to their sister party Zanu PF and also part of the material has come from the Chinese Government to the Government of Zimbabwe.
“Again, a friend who comes when you are lying on your belly is indeed a friend. Efforts to contain this dramatic increase in the number of cases in the last month have necessitated that we tighten the lockdown to support enhanced testing, community surveillance and cluster identification. “There was a period when we felt complacent when the figures were very low but of recent the surge, the spike is frightening, so I appeal to our people to stay at home,”
The President added that whenever Zimbabwe sought a shoulder to lean on, China has always been ready to listen and provide help.
“China under the President Xi Jinping has throughout consulted us, communicated with us to find out what assistance we need and every single request I have made, I have been replied to positively. On behalf of Zimbabwe and indeed on our behalf, I wish you Your Excellency to express and convey our sincere appreciation to the response we receive from the China,” the President said.
Apart from the donation that was made by China, Vice President Chiwenga, who was recently in China also sourced equipment to help the nation fight the pandemic.
“To my brother VP Chiwenga who has just arrived from China two days ago. Despite his condition, he remembered that there are problems at home and used whatever resources he had at his disposal to buy Covid-19 equipment, which he is now donating to the Government.
“We have so many citizens in the country who have means, who have capacity. Yes, I am grateful, not all Zimbabweans have ignored. I am proud that certain individuals, companies, private and the public sector churches and other organisations have come forward to express their compassion to fight and mitigate the impact of Covid-19. I am grateful that when our nation gets challenged, we have a citizenry, which stands up shoulder to shoulder to fight the challenges.”
Handing over the donation, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Guo Shaochun commended the New Dispensation for its commitment towards the fight against the pandemic. The ambassador said that the unity between the two countries in the fight against the pandemic has demonstrated a strong friendship that is unbreakable
“Now we are entering a new phase in this fight as community transmission picks up, we are alert but not deterred because I have seen first-hand the grit of Zimbabweans and China is determined to stick with you,” said the Ambassador.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'DEU': ['Federal Republic of Germany'], 'GBR': ['United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland']}",diplomatic_statement,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

BY VENERANDA LANGA
The MP said this while outlining a report on the 2018 allocation for the Women Affairs and Youth ministry using a PowerPoint presentation in the National Assembly.
“I brought in this House sanitary cups that can be used for 10 years and I spoke to the manufacturer, who said they can sell one at $6,50, and if we put aside $6 million, we will be able to deal with all young girls, who will not need to worry about sanitary wear,” she said.
“Why have condoms in the budget, but not sanitary wear and yet for men over 40 or 45 years having an erection is more like winning a lottery, and so we have condoms that are actually not being used because most of these men have (erectile) problems?”
Misihairabwi-Mushonga blasted the Women and Youth ministry for “weak” programmes after it mentioned small projects like supporting 100 gardening schemes instead of targeting the likes of mining and manufacturing.
She said the new government must change the old behaviour and embark on change management, which required doing away with old ineffective people that run ministries.
In an unrelated matter, Norton MP, Temba Mliswa (independent) implored Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga and Zanu PF chairperson, Oppah Muchinguri to ensure that the ruling party puts finality on MPs it expelled, but were still attending Parliament.
“Section 129(k) of the Constitution requires that the party must put its house in order and make a decision on those MPs expelled from the party because they are still coming to Parliament, but cannot participate because they are not sure of their position. An example is former Health deputy minister Paul Chimedza, who was expelled from the party, but he comes to Parliament and is not participating in committee work because the party has not dealt with this issue,” Mliswa said.
Deputy Speaker Mabel Chinomona ruled that Mliswa could not demand Chiwenga to deal with the issue immediately in Parliament, as it was a Zanu PF matter.
Earlier on, Speaker of the National Assembly Jacob Mudenda had urged Zanu PF to allow the concerned MPs to attend a workshop this weekend to discuss mines and minerals and exploration laws.

Herald Reporter
Chinese President Xi Jinping has congratulated President Mugabe on his 92nd birthday, wishing him good health. President Mugabe turned 92 on Sunday, and official celebrations to mark his birthday will be held under the auspices of the 21st February Movement in Masvingo on Saturday.
“I wish to extend my warm congratulations and best wishes on the occasion of your birthday,” said President Xi, who visited Zimbabwe last year on a State Visit where he, together with President Mugabe, witnessed the signing of mega deals between Zimbabwe and China.
“In December last year, I paid a State Visit to your country, enjoyed your warm reception and mapped out a grand blueprint for the future development of China-Zimbabwe relations with you.
“We, together, attended the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation. Your splendid speech at the Summit and your penetrating insights into the development of China-Africa relations made profound impression on me.”
President Xi said he was ready to work with President Mugabe to deepen political mutual trust and bilateral practical cooperation and “together start a new chapter for China-Zimbabwe and China-Africa friendship”.
“I wish you good health and may everything go well with you,” said President Xi.
Pakistan ambassador Mr Asaf Khan also sent his congragulatory message, praising President Mugabe for his good leadership qualities. “He is an icon, a legend,” he told ZBC News. “He is a Statesman with good leadership qualities for the nation and Africa. His endeavour is to raise the standards of Africa.”
Congratulatory messages for President Mugabe started pouring in on Sunday, with various Government departments and State enterprises wishing him happiness, good health and more strength.
Elders from Zvimba, his home area, congratulated him saying living that long could only be through the love and will of God.
Gogo Agatha Nyere, who is younger sister to President Mugabe’s late mother, Mbuya Bona, vividly narrated to ZBC News how he grew up from a young rural boy in Kutama to become the President.
Gogo Cecillia Mupariwa Zindoga, a neighbour at Cde Mugabe’s rural home, said the whole of Kutama neighbourhood felt blessed by the gift of long life bestowed on the President, as he is “a man of the people”. An uncle to President Mugabe, Mr Philemon Kutama, said he worked hard and suffered to lead Zimbabwe and Africa.
“It was during our boyhood that he developed an avid culture of reading,” he said.
“As the youngest of the herd boys of that time, I had to assume the duties of monitoring the movement of cattle as the elder, Robert (Mugabe), buried his face into books.”
Mr Kutama said President Mugabe’s rise from just a herd boy to become President was not achieved overnight, but followed a difficult road punctuated with prison, suffering, hunger and tears.
President Mugabe’s love for books did not end during his time as a boy, as he went on to become a teacher, before acquiring a degree from Fort Hare University in South Africa. He also taught in Ghana before returning home to participate in full time politics.
During his time in prison between 1964 and 1975, President Mugabe also studied and acquired many degrees.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Masvingo', 'Zvimba District', 'Kutama'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa', 'Johannesburg'], 'GHA': ['Republic of Ghana']}",diplomatic_statement,"['Xi Jinping', 'Chinese']","['Xi Jinping', 'Chinese']","['Chinese', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese']"

Herald Reporters
AMID an increase in Covid-19 positive cases on the continent, especially among returning citizens, President Mnangagwa has called for greater solidarity among world states in the fight against the deadly disease, while China has announced debt cancellation to African countries.
In a virtual address at the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against Covid-19, that was co-chaired by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Senegalese President Macky Sall, the incoming chairperson of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), President Mnangagwa yesterday saluted China for helping African countries, including Zimbabwe, in confronting the novel-pandemic.
“At the end of March 2020, Zimbabwe imposed a nationwide lockdown in an effort to contain the pandemic. The lockdown measures yielded positive results. However, of late there has been a spike in the number of imported cases on account of returning residents. We are in need of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test kits to scale up our testing while we equally focus on isolation, quarantine and contact tracing of the affected persons,” he said.
The country has received over 9 000 returnees from 48 countries with the number of positive cases rising sharply in the past two weeks from 54 to 401 as of yesterday, but with still only four deaths.
Most of the cases are coming from South Africa and Botswana.
By yesterday the world death toll reached 445 468, on 8 261 260 cases although the number of infected is higher since some countries cannot test all suspected cases. But death figures are accurate. There have been 4 013 202 confirmed recoveries.
In his virtual address to the forum, President Xi announced a debt cancellation to African countries, saying the Asian economic powerhouse would continue cooperating with African countries.
“Within the FOCAC framework, China will cancel the debt of relevant African countries in the form of interest-free government loans that are due to mature by the end of 2020,” he said.
“For those African countries that are hardest hit by the coronavirus and are under heavy financial stress, China will work with the global community to give them greater support, by such means as further extending the period of debt suspension, to help them tide over the current difficulty.
“We encourage Chinese financial institutions to respond to the G20’s Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and to hold friendly consultations with African countries according to market principles to work out arrangements for commercial loans with sovereign guarantees. China will work with other members of the G20 to implement the DSSI and, on that basis, urge the G20 to extend debt service suspension still further for countries concerned, including those in Africa,” said President Xi.
President Mnangagwa took the opportunity to thank China for its continued support to Zimbabwe and Africa in fighting the disease.
“We welcome the initiatives announced by President Xi to continue assisting developing countries in the fight against the pandemic. Going forward, through this platform there is a scope to explore other opportunities in research and development in public health issues, pharmaceutical and medical equipment production,” President Mnangagwa said.
He also pledged to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries at national level.
President Xi stressed the need for sanctions against Zimbabwe and South Sudan to be lifted to enable the two countries to effectively mobilise resources needed in the fight against Covid-19.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa who is also the AU chairperson echoed the same sentiments, saying the continent had not been spared by the global contagion and its economic and social effects.
In response to the pandemic, the AU chairperson said Africa is setting up a fund that its member states will draw from in the fight against the world pestilence.
“As the AU we have established an African Covid-19 Response Fund as a key intervention to mobilise and direct resources towards the continent’s response to the challenge,” said President Ramaphosa.
He said because of the pandemic, that has killed 6 700 people on the continent with 250 000 confirmed infections, economies in Africa will suffer gravely.
“We would like to ask China to consider support for the provision of diagnostic and therapeutic supplies over a period of six months. This support would be managed by AfriExImBank in collaboration with its counterpart in China. This would allow several African countries to procure goods from China,” he said.
Since Zimbabwe recorded its first case of the global pandemic, China has been consistent in its support for Government efforts to curb the contagion.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa'], 'SDN': ['Republic of the Sudan']}",diplomatic_statement,['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping'],"['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,3933,herald.co.zw,2015-04-20T00:02:35Z,Bonus: Chinamasa speaks out,"Minister Chinamasa
Tendai Mugabe Senior Reporter
FINANCE and Economic Development minister Patrick Chinamasa yesterday said President Mugabe’s directive to reinstate civil servants bonuses will be implemented as directed saying the announcement of the suspension of bonuses for two years had been due to procedural mistakes.
Minister Chinamasa’s comments come in the wake of President Mugabe’s announcement that the suspension of civil servants bonuses was null and void as neither Cabinet nor the Presidency had approved the move.
Also read…
Minister Chinamasa had announced the suspension of civil servants’ bonuses for the next two years in line with measures aimed at creating fiscal space to fund Zim-Asset.
Although the announcement was welcomed by economists as a painful but necessary measure, President Mugabe said the Presidency and Cabinet had not approved the decision.
Addressing thousands of Zimbabweans who gathered to celebrate the country’s 35th Independence anniversary at the National Sports Stadium on Saturday, President Mugabe assured Government workers that they would be paid their 13th cheque as usual.
Minister Chinamasa admitted mistakes were made.
“I acknowledge we have committed mistakes and overlooked the procedures but these mistakes are understandable and have been made in good faith.
“We were bound to make the mistakes given the budgetary pressures weighing heavily on the shoulders of Treasury. Primarily the challenges we are facing in meeting the 2014 bonus commitments, the challenges to do with the payment of pensions and wages for our foreign missions.
“The challenges to do with our failure to remit contributions to the Premier Service Medical Aid Society for the good health of the bulk of civil servants as well as the challenge in meeting the debt repayment commitments we have made to our creditors so as to open doors in the future for new resources to be made available to us so as to sustain our country’s journey to economic recovery,” he said.
Minister Chinamasa said also alarming is the increasing failure to pass on salary deductions under the stop order system to various creditors of civil servants.
He said to overcome the challenges Government feels the urge to work hard to pursue efforts which lead to economic recovery.
“We must run if not sprint so as to make up for lost time. In the process we have tripped and made some mistakes and I am happy that His Excellency (President Mugabe) in his speech at the Independence celebrations has corrected our mistakes and in a manner has lifted us back to our feet and given us a clear command and mandate to continue the effort to find and ‘explore ways of cutting down the bloated public service wage bill’ which continues to be an albatross around our necks. It is eating into funds which should be deployed towards financing Zim-Asset,” he said.
Addressing thousands of people who gathered for the main 35th Independence anniversary celebrations at the National Sports Stadium on Saturday, President Mugabe said Government will pay its employees the 13th cheque come year-end.
“I want to thank all our public servants for the support they gave to the Government, support which has seen us go through the year in peace and harmony, go through the year in achieving some of our programmes.
“We have maintained peace, indeed. We have done much as what was afforded by our financial capacity. I want to say, through the Public (Service) Commission, thank you, thank you civil servants.
“At the same time, I want to make it clear that the reports in the newspapers, that bonuses were being withdrawn, is not Government policy.
“The Cabinet did not approve all that and the Presidency was never, never consulted on the matter. We were never consulted; the three of us, and that is myself and the Vice Presidents. And we say that is disgusting to us and it will never be implemented at all. So, let the civil servants not be down-hearted; that will not happen. The rules are that when Government bestows a benefit on civil servants, that benefit cannot be withdrawn because it has become a right.
“That is there in the rules, and our rules handling the governing of public servants. When they are given a benefit, we cannot reverse it at all. It has become their right and that is what we stand by. So, your bonuses will come to you,” President Mugabe said.
Minister Chinamasa spoke as civil servants yesterday hailed President Mugabe for reinstating their bonuses saying his intervention was a much-needed morale and confidence booster.
A wave of despondency, they said, threatened to cripple service delivery following the announcement of the suspension of bonuses.
In separate interviews, civil service unions said President Mugabe’s pronouncement brought relief to Government employees.
Zimta chief executive officer Mr Sifiso Ndlovu said the bold announcement showed that the President cared about the plight of workers.
“The announcement by the Head of State and Government is a demonstration that he is a principled leader with the interests of the workers at heart,” he said.
“It is also a moral and confidence restoration move. We have always been questioning the validity of the announcement made by the Minister (Chinamasa).
“As civil servants we feel that the announcement by the President will reduce the amount of despondency that was already building in the civil service as a result of the announcement by the Finance Minister.”
Civil servants, Mr Ndlovu said, would now press on the provision of other non-monetary benefits promised by Government.
He said such benefits were long overdue although Government had committed to fund them through the National Social Security Authority.
“Government promised way back to implement non monetary benefits through mobilising NSSA funds,” he said.
“Now that the issue of bonuses is resolved, we now have fertile ground to discuss the provision of such benefits.”
College Lecturers Association of Zimbabwe president Mr David Dzatsunga said they were happy with the President’s intervention which he said was humanistic and pro-poor.
“We are quite happy that the President has stepped in to save the situation that had already dispirited the entire civil service,” he said.
“The President’s announcement is evident that this attempt to deny us our bonuses was illegal.
“It is very instructive to note that as civil service unions we were not consulted on this matter the same way the Presidency was not also consulted. In this regard, we applaud the intervention by the President and it shows that he has the workers at heart.”
Mr Dzatsunga said Minister Chinamasa’s announcement was not only a slap to the civil servants but the generality of workers in Zimbabwe.
He said even the private sector took a cue from Government and the precedence that Minister Chinamasa attempted to set was not only irrational but also not unacceptable.
Last week, economists applauded the scrapping of civil servants bonuses saying that would eventually lead to full national economic recovery.
Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries president Mr Charles Msipa described the move as a good essential starting point.
Employers Confederation of Zimbabwe president Mr Jack Murehwa, said Government had taken a rational business decision.
Mr Murehwa said if the bonuses were to be paid, then Government would have to borrow the additional cash or raise additional taxes and levies in an environment where business and individuals were already seriously taxed.

Zimbabwe,4784,zimbabwesituation.com,2015-09-18T09:11:21Z,Govt row: Min slams pro-whites Chinamasa,"IN A sign of confusion in the cabinet linked to the bitter fights over President Robert Mugabe’s succession, war veterans minister Chris Mutsvangwa has hit out at finance minister Patrick Chinamasa’s pro-IMF strategy.
The outspoken Mutsvangwa further attacked “some of ministers in the cabinet (who) still think the white man is superior”.
Mutsvangwa is a key ally of vice president and succession aspirant Emmerson Mnangagwa while Chinamasa is close to the Zanu PF faction working to block a Mnangagwa presidency.
And indicating that the succession question is also impacting efforts to right the failing economy Mutsvangwa effectively accused Chinamasa of treachery by claiming the IMF which the Finance Minister is actively wooing wants to topple Mugabe.
“They (IMF) want to remove Mugabe … they want Tsvangirai to be on the helm,” Mutsvangwa told a war veterans meeting in Mutare this week.
Chinamasa has been working hard to get Zimbabwe back into the good graces of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a desperate bid to secure debt relief, new financial support and to improve the country’s battered image in the West.
He has made some progress which is why he reacted with annoyance when Mutsvangwa tried to throw spanners into the works by attacking the IMF at a meeting with a delegation from the institution last week.
Chinamasa, at the time, called his cabinet colleague to order, reminding him that Zimbabwe was not paying its debts.
“We owe countries and international financial institutions huge amounts of money, hence we should not politicize the situation,” said the treasury chief.
But Mutsvangwa hit back while addressing a provincial war veterans meeting in Mutare recently.
“Some ministers in the cabinet still think white man is superior,” he said.
“They have the mentality that whatever comes from America is number one; whatever comes from British is first.
“That’s a wrong mentality but I will stand by you. We are the brave of the brave.”
Mutsvangwa then went for the jugular, effectively accusing Chinamasa of trying to topple Mugabe by working with the IMF.
“We have nothing to do with IMF because their agenda is removing war veterans from influential positions in government,” he said.
“They want security sector reform and they want Tsvangirai to be on the helm of the government.
“They want to remove Mugabe and war veterans from power because they want access to our wealth.”
Zimbabwe’s economic salvation, Mutsvangwa stated, could only be secured through Mnangangwa’s China strategy.
“There are plans to build a new Harare city and VP Mnangagwa has met the Chinese to discuss the project,” he said.
“The matter will be soon taken to cabinet for consideration. It involves links of roads to South Africa as well as links to Beira. This means it’s a multi-billion dollar investment.
“Initially, capital will be around $5 billion which is not coming from the government but we will use our minerals as a guarantee to Chinese which President Mugabe agreed to.
“We will call the Canadians and Australians to evaluate our minerals and we pay back the Chinese using our minerals.
“The new city will generate money to pay back the debt.”",0,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Mutare'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa'], 'MOZ': ['Beira']}",diplomatic_statement,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']
Zimbabwe,2390,zimbabwesituation.com,2014-05-04T22:41:45Z,VP Mujuru defends Chinamasa,"Vice-President Joice Mujuru yesterday said Government was fully behind Finance and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa in his mandate to lead the country’s economic turnaround.
She also criticised some Government officials for “spending a lot of time in their offices” instead of interacting with key industry players with a view to developing the economy.
The Vice-President, who was addressing the Zanu-PF Mashonaland East Provincial Women’s League Conference here, said it was important for all Zimbabweans to rally behind the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (Zim Asset).
She added that while Zanu-PF fought for the country’s independence without a budget, Minister Chinamasa had given Zimbabwe economic guidelines through his National Budget presentation.
“There are a lot of people saying our Finance Minister is not good enough. Some say, ‘How can a lawyer be the Finance Minister? (President) Mugabe is only taking his cronies.’ What I can tell you today is we are fully behind him and we will support him.
“As if that is not enough, you have some in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce who think their job is to stay in offices in Harare. Go to the communities and encourage our people to produce and work hard.
“The party liberated this country without a budget. They can control money, but can they control our minds? Let’s make sure that as Zimbabweans, we work hard and produce so that we can have food security at household level.”
Vice-President Mujuru took a swipe at some farmers who expected free Government inputs without producing.
She said the Zanu-PF Government was focusing on food security at household level and a decent living for all Zimbabweans as enunciated in Zim Asset.
“This is our motto: food security for everyone regardless of their political affiliation. But, unfortunately, we have some of our people who are not doing what they are supposed to do at the farms.
“They got very productive farms, but are doing nothing. You hear them boasting of large pieces of land. If you are that kind of a person, you are letting the country and those who fought for this country down.
“Imagine those millions we have wasted in importing maize, yet we can grow it ourselves. This year, the Presidential Input Scheme has made sure that every family has enough food. Let’s continue to work hard as women so that we can produce enough food.”

PRESIDENT Mnangagwa has sent a condolence message to China following the death of former leader Jiang Zemin describing him as an outstanding statesman who led his country into growth and progress.
Jiang (96) died last Wednesday in Shanghai.
In a condolence message at the Chinese Embassy in Harare, President Mnangagwa said he had fond memories of Jiang visiting Zimbabwe in 1996.
“In memory of our dear leader Jiang Zemin. I am deeply saddened by the death of the Former President of the People’s Republic of China H.E Cde Jiang Zemin. In Cde Jiang Zemin, China and indeed the progressive world have lost a great Statesman and established international Diplomat who contributed to the greater cooperation between China and the international community.
“I personally have fond memories of my personal interaction with the late Cde Jiang Zemin in 1996, when he paid a visit to Zimbabwe on a state visit and I was assigned by the late President RG Mugabe to accompany him. The visit was indeed successful and cemented the excellent relations we enjoy today between the Republic of Zimbabwe and the People’s Republic of China. May I once again express my deepest condolences to the People’s Republic of China and the family of Cde Jiang Zemin on their loss. Farewell Cde Jiang Zemin.”
Jiang became China’s leader in 1989 and will be remembered for presiding over a decade of breakneck economic growth and rising prosperity in China as it became a global superpower.
He oversaw notable events like China’s entry into the World Trade Organisation and the handover of Hong Kong from the British to the Chinese.
In 1996, Jiang visited Zimbabwe as part of a six-nation African State visit.

Zvamaida Murwira, Harare Bureau
FINANCE and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa, yesterday slammed Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development Minister Professor Jonathan Moyo over his attacks on Government’s Command Agriculture Programme equating him to a barking dog that would not stop the programme.
Minister Chinamasa said this during the National Assembly’s question and answer session, while responding to a question from Zvimba West legislator Cde Ziyambi Ziyambi (Zanu-PF) on why the Government was not pulling in one direction over Command Agriculture.
Harare East legislator Cde Terrence Mukupe (Zanu-PF), had also asked Minister Chinamasa to clarify on funding of Command Agriculture given that some Government Ministers, especially Prof Moyo, were going on social media to attack the programme despite them being part of deliberations in Cabinet.
“The fact that some people are not in agreement is a non event when the programme is moving well. Varikutaura imbwa dziri kuhukura,” (those talking are barking dogs) said Minister Chinamasa in apparent reference to Prof Moyo who has relentlessly slammed the Government food initiative on his Twitter Account. Prof Moyo has been using social media to denigrate the programme calling it “command ugly culture” despite him being one of the beneficiaries at his farm in Mashonaland Central province.
He reportedly approached The Standard newspaper last week with a story attacking Command Agriculture, VP Mnangagwa and the programme’s financier, Sakunda Holdings, and reportedly assisted in the editing of the story.
Commander Zimbabwe Defence Forces General Constantino Chiwenga, war veterans and political analysts have called for Prof Moyo’s censure and urged him to resign if he does not agree with Government policies.
Minister Chinamasa said financial institutions that were initially reluctant to fund the programme, had already started coming on board, giving more credence to the programme.
“Following the success of that programme, we have begun to see commercial banks coming into play because these inputs must be paid up-front. Sakunda Holdings has started working with these commercial banks which are CBZ, Barclays and another one. Those who fail to repay would jeorpadise their chances of getting support in future,” said Minister Chinamasa.
He said the programme had exceeded Government expectations despite some challenges that were faced.
The latest crop assessment has revealed that over four million tonnes of food crops were harvested against national consumption of three million tonnes.
Chitungwiza North National Assembly Mr Godfrey Sithole (MDC-T), asked what criteria was used to select Sakunda.
In response, Minister Chinamasa said any person or financial institution prepared to lend Government money at less than five percent interest rate and willing to be repaid after one year was free to participate.
“We are going to support 1,8 million household. We will also be going on command fishery, livestock among others, soya-beans among others,” said Minister Chinamasa.
He said he had established a unit in his Ministry to study the reports from Auditor General and determine how to respond to recommendations.
He was responding to questions from Glen Norah MP Mr Webster Maondera (MDC-T), on why there was no action being taken against State entities that violated corporate governance procedures.
“I prefer that we get a draft of the Auditor’s report and then we can comment. We did not have the apparatus to read the report.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has congratulated President Mnangagwa and the people of Zimbabwe for attaining 38 years of independence. Zimbabwe marked Independence Day yesterday, which came in 1980 following a protracted liberation struggle supported by China among other countries.
“On the occasion of the 38th anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Zimbabwe, I wish to extend on behalf of the Chinese government and people, my sincere congratulations and best wishes to you and through you to the Zimbabwean Government and people,” said President Xi in his message.
“Your State visit to China at the beginning of this month was a great success, during which we agreed on the elevation of our bilateral relations to Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Cooperation and reached broad consensus on deepening friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation across the board.
“I attach great importance to the growth of China-Zimbabwe relations. I am ready to work together with you to advance our bilateral cooperation for more tangible fruits to the greater benefits of our two countries and peoples. I wish Zimbabwe prosperity and its people happiness.”
Zimbabwe and China enjoy cordial relations dating back to the days of the liberation struggle when the Asian country helped fighters with combat logistics and training.
The relations were elevated to comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership for better development when President Mnangagwa visited China early this month.
President Xi said his country was ready to work with Zimbabwe to jointly plan a new blueprint for bilateral cooperation and continue writing a new chapter of China-Zimbabwe relations to better benefit the two countries and their peoples.
The two sides agreed to enhance the alignment of development strategies, deepen cooperation within the frameworks of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and continue to orderly promote cooperation in such areas as infrastructure construction, agriculture, investment and financing.

Zimbabwe,309,theindependent.co.zw,2012-06-22T13:21:51Z,China helps Zanu PF to map poll strategy,"Brian Chitemba
ZANU PF has roped in the services of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to draw up strategies to revive its waning support base in Matabeleland ahead of the next elections.
A CCP delegation met the Zanu PF politburo, central committee and district coordinating committee members from Bulawayo, Matabeleland North and South on Tuesday to formulate ways of enticing the electorate.
Zanu PF lost control of the Matabeleland provinces after the MDC first contested elections in 2000, and the party believes that borrowing CCP strategies would help revive its flagging fortunes.
The CCP’s Centre for International Exchanges director-general, Wu Shumin, advised Zanu PF to address relevant issues facing the Matabeleland region, saying the party would only be electable if its policies solved problems facing the region’s electorate.
Zanu PF is unpopular in Matabeleland due to perceived marginalisation and unfulfilled development projects, and the Gukurahundi atrocities committed by the Zanu PF government in the 1980s believed to have resulted in the deaths of about 20 000 people.
Shumin advised the party to address poverty, unemployment, housing shortages, deteriorating healthcare, rampant corruption and industrial development. Bulawayo has particularly been hit by de-industrialisation which saw the closure of 87 companies leaving about 20 000 jobless.
The CCP backed the controversial indigenisation programme saying it would gain Zanu PF political mileage because the black majority had been disenfranchised for decades.
“The party’s greatest strength lies in connecting with the people and there should not be a time when it is alienated from them,” said China Executive Leadership Academy official Liu Jingbei.
“Successful parties derive their strength from vibrant grassroots structures and discipline among members,” Jingbei said.
Meanwhile, Zanu PF has tasked its politburo members to come up with a raft of recommendations on how the party can win the next elections to ensure that President Robert Mugabe holds onto his 32-year rule.
The party’s national commissar Webster Shamu wrote to all politburo, central committee and national consultative assembly members instructing them to analyse Zanu PF’s performance in the 2008 elections and give him feedback urgently.
Zanu PF officials told the Independent that the 2008 election analysis and recommendations were a waste of time, particularly in Matabeleland where Mugabe has never been popular with the electorate.
“Who will vote Zanu PF in Matabeleland?” asked a senior party official from the region. “We can’t win in this region because people feel marginalised and if Mugabe rejects devolution then forget the Matabeleland vote.”
Senior party officials in Bulawayo met at the provincial headquarters on Sunday, but failed to come up with any recommendations as they were soon sucked into a bitter debate over district structures.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Matabeleland North Province', 'Bulawayo']}",political_process_policy_intervention,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

However, we feel there is a need for moderation in those budgets because how does one justify huge budgets that are way over what we spent during the population census.”But a ZEC official who requested anonymity said the budget was realistic.“Population census doesn’t have polling stations. How can the referendum be compared with population census when we will have about 11 staffers at each polling station compared to just an individual going around homes asking how many people are there,” said the source.ZEC deputy chief elections officer responsible for finance and administration Mr Notai Mutemasango confirmed they received $2 million for ink to be used in the referendum.The negotiators in the inclusive Government yesterday met the Sadc facilitation team and briefed them on the progress made in the constitution making process.Speaking after meeting the facilitators, Minister Chinamasa said the parties would urge their supporters to vote for the new constitution.“Negotiators met the Sadc facilitation team and it was a joint meeting,” he said.“We updated the team on progress made so far in terms of the new supreme law and the respective political parties communicated that they are going to campaign for a Yes Vote.”Minister Chinamasa said the parties told the team that the election roadmap would be clearer after the determination of the dates for the referendum.",0,,,{},political_process_policy_intervention,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']
Zimbabwe,797,thezimbabwean.co,2013-02-27T08:10:00Z,Chinamasa backtracks and says election funding is secured,"Chinamasa was quoted by the newspaper on Sunday as stating that some US$80 million had been secured from local firms to fund the referendum, set for March 16th.He then told SW Radio Africa’s correspondent Simon Muchemwa on Monday that he was “misquoted” and that no money was secured.This was backed up by Finance Minister Tendai Biti who told a press conference in Harare on Monday that no money had yet been secured. He had told journalists last Friday that there was no enough time to get money from international donors, and the government would be turning to local firms.However, Chinamasa later on Monday backtracked and said the money has been secured. The Minister, currently in Geneva, told SW Radio Africa’s Muchemwa that acting-Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa was set to make a statement and that “we just need to figure out the modalities on how we get this money to ZEC.” He gave no other details about where the money has been sourced from.Economist John Robertson told SW Radio Africa that if funding is sourced from within the country the money will most likely come from the Mbada diamond mining firm or from Econet.“Econet is not only earning money in Zimbabwe. It has broadened its base across Southern Africa and its revenue source is larger than Zimbabwe’s market. So they (Mbada and Econet) appear to have between them at least US$65 million that is needed,” Robertson said.He explained that very few other companies in Zimbabwe are able provide the millions required by the government on such short notice, saying that “the purchasing power of Zimbabwean consumers remains very constrained.”Robertson also speculated that there have been “few details of the agreements published because partly the government might be embarrassed to admit they can’t be sure of a repayment date. And lenders could be embarrassed because they have been pressured into lending something without seeking the assurances of repayment they needed first,” Robertson said.He added: “There is caution on both sides because people are not happy about an agreement that have been forced into making.” – SW Radio Africa News",0,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'USA': ['Geneva']}",political_process_policy_intervention,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']
Zimbabwe,1032,newsday.co.zw,2013-07-19T00:00:00Z,‘Chinamasa scuttles poll funding’,"FINANCE minister Tendai Biti yesterday accused Justice and Legal Affairs minister Patrick Chinamasa of scuttling poll funding offers by refusing to co-operate with donors willing to fund the July 31 elections.
REPORT BY WONAI MASVINGISE
Biti said some foreign donors had offered to release $60 million, but Chinamasa had allegedly spurned the offer by refusing to meet the donors’ demands.
The minister declined to spell out the donors’ demands.
“Donors want to give us money, but there are certain things that need to be done,” Biti said.
“Chinamasa promised to write a letter on Monday, but up until now he has not done so. I cannot find him even on his mobile phone. I am so frustrated that this national responsibility is solely being left to the Ministry of Finance. Zanu PF wants to put me in a position that they can say Biti failed to fund the election.
We have just disbursed $20 million and we are now endeavouring to find the $60 million that is now outstanding.”
Early this year, Cabinet tasked Biti (MDC-T) and Chinamasa (Zanu PF) to jointly source poll funding, but the efforts collapsed after Chinamasa and some elements within Zanu PF turned down offers by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), accusing the UN agency of pursuing a regime change agenda.
The fallout followed UNDP’s insistence on a needs assessment audit.
Zanu PF hardliners have insisted that election funds should be sourced locally.
Although all efforts to get a comment from Chinamasa were fruitless amid reports that he had left for Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to attend the Peace and Security Council today on Zimbabwe’s election preparedness, sources indicated that the polls could be financed on credit.
The sources added the debt would reportedly be settled after polls like what happened during the national census where service providers were paid after the event.
Ballot papers would be printed at quasi-government entities Printflow and Fidelity Printers while CMED would mobilise vehicles for transportation of voting materials.
Preparations for the make-or-break harmonised polls have been fraught with challenges, especially money.

Zimbabwe,1092,herald.co.zw,2013-08-05T02:46:35Z,"Zuma endorses poll outcome, All urged to accept result, China, Kenya echo facilitator’s sentiments, MDC-T leader gangs up with handlers","Cde Zuma
Daniel Nemukuyu and Zvamaida Murwira
SADC facilitator Cde Jacob Zuma, Kenyan President Mr Uhuru Kenyatta and the Chinese government have congratulated President Mugabe and Zanu-PF on their landslide victory in the just-ended harmonised elections and urged all parties to accept the result. Cde Zuma said the result should be respected as observers said it was an expression of the will of the people.
The UN, AU, Sadc, Comesa and other observer groups from Africa have endorsed the elections while the United States, Britain and its dominion Australia — who were not invited to observe — have joined MDC-T in condemning the election.
This has effectively put MDC-T leader Mr Morgan Tsvangirai and his Western sponsors on one side, and Africa and Zanu-PF on another side aping the contestation in Zimbabwe over the past decade.
A Sadc diplomat, who declined to be named, said the issue was no longer just about Zimbabwe.
‘‘It’s now Africa versus Britain, the US and Australia. What is now on trial is Africa’s own verdict over its own poll versus European interests,’’ he said.
Analysts say Britain, the US and Australia — who are still to remove their sanctions regimes — were trying to defend their stance by parroting the MDC-T claims, yet the sanctions regimes, along with the pirate broadcasts they have since intensified, were the major outstanding GPA issue.
British ambassador to Zimbabwe Ms Deborah Bronnert yesterday told SkyNews that: “We have some very serious concerns about both the failures of very important reforms before the elections, but also some issues about the conduct of the elections on the day itself.”
Australian foreign minister Bob Carr yesterday called for a rerun saying without a new election, Australia won’t lift its sanctions regime.
EU ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Aldo Dell’Ariccia differed with the hawks, saying the EU was for dialogue, and its relationship with Zimbabwe would depend on how Zanu-PF uses its two-thirds Parliamentary majority, particularly where the Constitution is concerned.
President Mugabe won the election with 61,09 percent of the votes, while his main rival Mr Tsvangirai (MDC-T) polled 33,94 percent.
Professor Welshman Ncube of MDC accounted for 2,68 percent, while Zapu leader Dr Dumiso Dabengwa and Mr Kisinoti Mukwazhe of the Zimbabwe Development Party got 0,74 percent and 0,29 percent respectively.
In a statement released through his International Relations and Co-operation spokesperson Mr Clayson Monyela, Cde Zuma described the election as a success.
“HE (His Excellency) President Jacob Zuma extends his profound congratulations to HE President Robert G Mugabe on his re-election as President of the Republic of Zimbabwe following the successful harmonised elections held on 31 July 2013.
“President Zuma urges all political parties in Zimbabwe to accept the outcome of the elections as election observers reported it to be an expression of the will of the people.”
Cde Zuma commended Zimbabweans for conducting a peaceful election and urged them to unite and work together towards the country’s development.
“He also encouraged the people of Zimbabwe to seize this opportunity to collectively contribute towards building their country driven by a common desire for peace, stability and prosperity,” said Mr Monyela.
Mr Zuma said South Africa was ready to continue partnering Zimbabwe in pursuit of mutually beneficial co-operation.
Mr Kenyatta also congratulated President Mugabe on his resounding win.
“My congratulations go out to President Robert Mugabe on his re-election in the just concluded Zimbabwe general election,” he said.
President Kenyatta hailed the good relations between Kenya and Zimbabwe, saying he looked forward to deepening the historical ties.
Asian powerhouse, China also joined in, congratulating the country for holding a peaceful poll.
“China congratulates Zimbabwe for the success of the election,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying was quoted as saying.
She urged the international community to respect the choice made by the people of Zimbabwe.
China is among the few countries which the Zimbabwean Government allowed to send observers to the harmonised elections last Wednesday.
The Chinese observer mission, which was led by former envoy on African Affairs Liu Guijin, described the election as peaceful, orderly and credible.
Other local and international observers from the African Union and Sadc have certified the polls as reflecting the will of the people and as free and fair.
Only the Tsvangirai-led MDC and two Western-sponsored non-governmental organisations, including the Zimbabwe Election Support Network, are disputing the poll outcome, alleging unproven vote-rigging.
Meanwhile, Government has dismissed claims that South Africa is set to reintroduce visa requirements for Zimbabweans as part of measures to reduce the influx of people crossing into that country.
Home Affairs Minister Kembo Mohadi said Zimbabwe was not aware of such a development.
The social media has been awash with reports that South Africa was set to reintroduce visa requirements for Zimbabweans as part of measures to shut out Zimbabweans.
But Minister Mohadi said no such communication was extended to the Government.
“I am not aware of that, I do not know anything about that,” he said.
“I do not have information to that effect unless it was done during the time I was out of office during elections.”
South Africa scrapped visa requirements for Zimbabweans in 2010 in part fulfilment of a Sadc Protocol on the Facilitation of Movement of Persons signed in 2005 in Gaborone, Botswana.
Authorities said the relaxation of visa rules was to facilitate the legal movement of people between South Africa and Zimbabwe and strengthen efforts to fight human trafficking, human smuggling and other cross-border crimes.

President Mnangagwa yesterday said the Government had put in place measures to ensure Monday’s harmonised elections are transparent, free, fair and credible.
Speaking at the BRICS Africa Outreach Dialogue at Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg, South Africa, the President said although campaigning for the elections had reached its climax, he decided to honour the invitation to attend the event because Government attached great importance to the group of the world’s emerging economies as its meetings made strategic deliberations.
“My country goes to the polls in two days’ time which are set to deepen our democratic traditions in keeping with the guidelines and standards set by Sadc and the African Union,” President Mnangagwa said at the dialogue that was held at the 10th BRICS Summit.
“I thank the observer missions, including some from BRICS countries, which have heeded our invitation to join us during this crucial plebiscite. Let me assure you that all measures have been put in place for peaceful, transparent, free, fair and credible elections.”
Presidents of BRICS member-states — Michel Temer (Brazil), Vladimir Putin (Russia), Xi Jinping (China), India Prime Minister Narendra Modi and host President Cyril Ramaphosa attended the three-day summit that ended yesterday. It ran under the theme “BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial Revolution”.
President Mnangagwa was among African leaders who attended the outreach that is meant to strengthen relations between BRICS and Africa. Angolan President Joao Lourenco, Edgar Lungu (Zambia), Hage Geingob (Nambia), Paul Kagame (Rwanda), Yoweri Museveni (Uganda), Peter Mutharika (Malawi), Macky Sall (Senegal)and Filipe Nyusi (Mozambique) also attended the dialogue.
President Mnangagwa said he considered it important for him to attend the BRICS Summit and have a chance to exchange views with other leaders as the grouping ushers in its second decade of cooperation.
“My country thus recognises this forum as one where crucial strategic matters are deliberated upon, which matters have a bearing on shaping new global inclusive sustainable development and mutually beneficial partnerships,” he said.
The theme for this year’s summit, he added, resonated with the country’s development aspirations.
“We welcome the numerous possibilities for cooperation it (BRICS) offers for my country,” he said.
“My country is determined to leapfrog our development and growth. We have started on an ambitious but attainable drive to industrialise and modernize all sectors of our economy. Opportunities abound in the infrastructure, mining, agro-processing, light-to-heavy industrial manufacturing, ICTs and financial services sectors. All these key economic aspects rank high on our vision to be a middle income country with a per capita income of $3 500, decent jobs, broad-based empowerment, free from poverty and corruption by 2030. We therefore welcome collaboration on multi-country projects which facilitate speedy regional and continental integration at tertiary levels where there is greater beneficiation of our mineral resources for Zimbabwe’s overall industrialization. Zimbabwe stands ready to enhance collaboration, inclusive growth and shared prosperity with all of you.”
The President lauded BRICS for championing multi-lateralism since its formation in 2006. This, he said, has secured the interests of most developing countries. He urged the grouping to remain steadfast in working towards a stronger and open multilateral system.
“If ever we needed one, the time is now,” he said.
“We can be happy that one of the BRICS countries’ currency is now counted among the IMFs basket of reserve currencies. Zimbabwe recognizes the merit of the BRICS ambition to make the world better, more uniformly developed and prosperous place for all mankind.

MDC-Alliance supporters yesterday ran berserk in central Harare after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) announced results, which saw the ruling Zanu-PF retaining its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.The ruling party had, by the time of going to print, won 144 seats against the MDC Alliance’s 61, while the National Patriotic Front won one and independent candidate Temba Mliswa also won.In an interview with journalists after a closed door meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Dr Sibusiso Moyo (Rtd) at his Munhumutapa offices, leader of the Chinese Observer Mission Mr Liu Guijin said Zimbabwe opposition should find better and peaceful ways to conduct itself in areas where it has disputes.Mr Liu said the opposition should refrain from going onto the street and destroying property and should use constitutional means to resolve problems at their disposal.Mr Liu was accompanied by Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Huang Ping as well as other members of the observer mission.“I came here for six days leading a small Chinese delegation of observers, I had the opportunity to observe the preparation work in Bindura, Norton and some other places also including Harare and also had the opportunity to visit some polling station,” said Mr Liu.“My impression is that this election, the preparation and ballot process is peaceful, orderly and the outcome naturally will be credible.“For Zimbabwe this is an important moment I hope that this election would be a new start. A new start for peace development and prosperity. . . if the opposition has different opinions or disputes they should resort to peaceful means, to constitutional means to resolve the problem and refrain from going onto the street and to destroy people’s properties,” he said.Mr Liu said Zimbabwe is at a great moment where it must arrest its troubles of the past by building on the foundation laid by the just ended elections.He said Zimbabweans should leverage on the abundant natural resources that the country is endowed with and rebuild the economy working together.“Zimbabwe is endowed with rich natural resources, with well-educated people and with multi-party system, I think if people work together – different political parties work together and they can make things different quite soon,” he said.He also said that as a good friend of Zimbabwe, China has been very helpful in the past with Zimbabwe’s development process and definitely it is going to continue on the same path after the elections.The peaceful and democratic elections, he said, will also send a good signal to the Chinese investors, whom he said should up their investments in the country.He also urged the Zimbabwean private sector to take advantage of their Chinese entrepreneurs and business counterparts who will be coming into the country in search of business partnerships.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",political_process_policy_intervention,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese']

“We wish to reiterate that the Communist Party of China values its profound, traditional friendship with Zanu-PF and stands ready to further deepen our friendly cooperation and to guide China-Zimbabwe comprehensive strategic partnership towards one new height after another, thus contributing to the building of an even closer community with a shared future for China and Africa.
“We sincerely wish Zanu-PF every success on your journey of leading and transforming Zimbabwe into a middle income economy by 2030. May the Republic of Zimbabwe enjoy prosperity, and her people happiness.”
In a statement, Russian President Vladimir Putin said: “Please accept my sincere congratulations on the occasion of the re-election to the Presidency of the Republic of Zimbabwe.
“I am confident that traditionally friendly relations between Russia and Zimbabwe will continue to develop for the benefit of the peoples of our nations in the process strengthening stability and security on the African continent. I wish you good health and every success in your important position of the Head of State.”
President Mnangagwa won the elections with 50,8 percent of the votes cast, beating his closest rival Mr Nelson Chamisa of the MDC-Alliance who got 44,3 percent.
President Mnangagwa’s ruling Zanu-PF also amassed 145 seats out the 210 contested seats to secure a comfortable two thirds majority in Parliament.
The President-elect has since received congratulatory messages from several leaders, including South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi.
On Monday, diplomats representing several African regions and the entire developing world visited President Mnangagwa at State House to congratulate him on his convincing victory.",1,,,"{'RUS': ['Russian Federation'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare']}",political_process_policy_intervention,"['Russia', 'China']",['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,9723,herald.co.zw,2018-08-02T02:47:05Z,Chinese observers endorse July 30 poll,"Ishemunyoro Chingwere Herald Reporter
THE Chinese election observer mission to Zimbabwe has endorsed the July 30 harmonised elections as peaceful, orderly and credible, and immediately condemned violent opposition elements that wreaked havoc in Harare yesterday.
MDC-Alliance supporters yesterday went berserk in central Harare after the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) announced results, which saw the ruling Zanu-PF retaining its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.
The ruling party had, by the time of going to print, won 144 seats against the MDC Alliance’s 61, with the National Patriotic Front and independent candidate Temba Mliswa winning one seat each.
In an interview with journalists after a closed door meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Dr Sibusiso Moyo at his Munhumutapa offices, leader of the Chinese Observer Mission Mr Liu Guijin said Zimbabwe’s opposition should find better and peaceful ways to conduct itself in areas where it has disputes.
Mr Liu said the opposition should refrain from going into the streets and destroying property and should use constitutional means to resolve problems at their disposal.
Mr Liu was accompanied by Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Huang Ping as well as other members of the observer mission.
“I came here for six days leading a small Chinese delegation of observers. I had the opportunity to observe the preparatory work in Bindura, Norton and some other places also including Harare and also had the opportunity to visit some polling stations,” said Mr Liu.
“My impression is that this election, the preparation and ballot process is peaceful, orderly and the outcome naturally will be credible.
“For Zimbabwe this is an important moment. I hope that this election will be a new start, Aanew start for peace development and prosperity. . . If the opposition has different opinions or disputes they should resort to peaceful means, to constitutional means to resolve the problem and refrain from going onto the street and to destroy people’s properties,” he said.
Mr Liu said Zimbabwe is at a great moment where it must arrest its troubles of the past by building on the foundation laid by the just ended elections.
He said Zimbabweans should leverage on the abundant natural resources that the country is endowed with and rebuild the economy together.
“Zimbabwe is endowed with rich natural resources, with well-educated people and with a multi-party (political) system, I think if people work together – different political parties work together and they can make things different quite soon,” he said.
He also added that as a good friend of Zimbabwe, China had been very helpful in the past with Zimbabwe’s development process and was definitely going to continue on the same path after the elections.
The peaceful and democratic elections, he said, will also send a positive signal to the Chinese investors, whom he said should up their investments in the country.
He also urged the Zimbabwean private sector to take advantage of Chinese entrepreneurs and business counterparts who will be coming into the country in search of business opportunities.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",political_process_policy_intervention,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese']
Zimbabwe,10888,herald.co.zw,2019-10-21T00:03:25Z,China slams Western meddling,"Herald Reporter
The Western hegemonic forces that imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe are the same instigators of Hong Kong riots that have seen the passing of a Bill by US lawmakers paving way for diplomatic action and economic sanctions against China.
This was said by Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Mr Guo Shaochun during a recent wide-ranging interview with The Herald, where he took a swipe at Western nations for “gross interference in China’s internal affairs”.
The sanctions imposed by Western powers, Ambassador Guo said, were a “tool” for meddling in the internal affairs of developing countries for “furtherance of own interests”.
The recent passing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in the US is seen as reminiscent of ZIDERA and an endorsement of anti-government violence.
Hong Kong’s violent protests started in June, against proposals to allow extradition to mainland China. Masked radicals and rioters have been forcing their way into protected buildings including the Legislative Building and the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government.
“Though China and Zimbabwe are geographically apart, what is happening to Hong Kong is not unfamiliar to Zimbabweans. It reminds people of the notorious Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001. Sanctions have become a tool of some Western countries to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs in furtherance of its own interests.
“This is blatant hegemonism and also shows that some countries are still intoxicated with the old dream of colonialism,” Ambassador Gou said.
“The US House of Representatives’ recent passage of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is another gross interference in China’s internal affairs. We express strong indignation on and firm opposition to it.”
China, the ambassador said, would “definitely take strong counter-measures in response to the wrong decisions by the US side to defend its sovereignty, security and development interests”.
He said while Western nations were against the Hong Kong government’s response to the riots, the same governments were using similar means to thwart dissent in their countries.
“Let’s see how the Western countries deal with the riots. In the US for instance, the police have every right to shoot whenever they deem a potential life-threat.
“Earlier this year, the European Parliament passed a resolution on the right to protest, considering what was happening in some parts of Europe around that time. The resolution underlined duties of the police and law enforcement authorities.
“It argued that the right to protest and freedom of expression are not without boundaries,” he said.
Ambassador Guo said maintaining rule of law is the incumbent responsibility of any responsible state or government.",1,,,"{'None': ['Europe'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'HKG': ['Hong Kong']}",political_process_policy_intervention,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,11832,herald.co.zw,2020-08-26T00:02:30Z,We don’t interfere in internal affairs: China,"Herald Reporter
China respects the sovereignty of other countries and will not interfere in internal issues, and claims that Beijing is involved in Anjin’s business deals in Zimbabwe and also stoking conflicts are grossly unfounded and aimed at driving a wedge between the two countries’ long running relations, a Chinese Embassy spokesperson has said.
The remarks follow fake news published in a local newspaper, which are seen as aimed at distorting and smearing the Chinese foreign policy towards Zimbabwe.
“The article is full of unfounded accusations, conjectures and sheer lies, proving nothing, but an appalling lack of common sense and self-confidence. The only motive for cooking up these absurdly far-stretched claims is to attract attention, sow discord in China-Zimbabwe bilateral friendly relations, and drag China into Zimbabwe’s internal affairs, all serving the author’s own hidden political agenda.
“Certainly, looking at this from his angle, we do understand this is an easy way for him to make money and gain political capital, even to live a better life. For this reason, perhaps some sympathy is due,” said the spokesperson.
The Chinese spokesperson said mutual respect for each other’s sovereignty, non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit were fundamental principles governing China’s relations with Zimbabwe.
“Sincerity, real results, affinity, and good faith are the philosophy underpinning China’s cooperation with and assistance to Zimbabwe. This is the reason why, despite being a developing country itself and still confronted with a host of difficulties and challenges, China has remained a steadfast supporter of Zimbabwe’s development over decades.
“Our dedicated and selfless help, in the form of grants and financing support, among others, has seen the construction of schools, hospitals, power stations and airports across the country,” the spokesperson said.
The spokesman said thousands of boreholes had been drilled, reconstruction of the areas hardest hit by Cyclone Idai is being pushed forward with full strength while over 10 000 tonnes of food were reaching ordinary Zimbabweans for years.
It added that no country in the world understands Zimbabwe better than Zimbabwe itself.
“Not interfering in or criticising Zimbabwe’s internal affairs is the bottom line of our foreign policy towards Zimbabwe. It is our firm conviction that no country can solve its problems by counting on external intervention.
“We trust the wisdom and capabilities of Zimbabweans themselves. Never before has China got itself involved in the internal affairs of Zimbabwe. Nothing we are doing at the moment is remotely close to this. Never in the future will we be interested in doing so.
“There is neither the intention nor the interest on China’s part. Those obsessed with fabricating lies about China doing this are either typically ignorant or obviously paranoid,” said the embassy spokesperson.
The Chinese Embassy applauded Zimbabwe for creating a conducive business environment, which would attract more investors including those from China, adding that more Chinese investors will be encouraged to take up local opportunities.
“Our consistent position, which warrants reiteration here, is that the Chinese government is not interested in taking resources from Zimbabwe. This is never our intention and we have never done anything close to it.
“In fact, it takes little more than a serious look at all the cooperation agreements between the two governments to see the fact. Mining is not in any way one of them; natural resources are not used as a collateral or in exchange for support in any of them. No Chinese state-owned enterprise is extracting such precious metals as gold, diamond, and platinum in Zimbabwe.”",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'Anjin'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe']}",political_process_policy_intervention,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

Speaking to a group of editors at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ International Press Centre in Beijing Tuesday, Ambassador Wang Ke in the Africa Department, said as a friend of Zimbabwe, they hope the elections would be conducted without interference.
“We are very confident that Zimbabwe has the ability to manage the elections, and they will be fair and successful. The Chinese government will fully respect the result of the election. Of course, it should be free and fair. It should be a choice by the people,.
Ambassador Wang pointed out the policy mandated by President Xi Jinping who said there are five “Nos” in China’s relations with the African continent in general.
“The first one is we do not interfere in the way African countries choose to develop and secondly, we will not interfere in domestic affairs and that includes elections.”
She added that China stands ready to further strengthen relations with Zimbabwe, which date back to the days of the liberation struggle.
“We support Zimbabwe particularly in safeguarding your sovereignty and national integrity. I want to mention that in 2008 China executed the right to veto the resolution made by the US and other Western countries to sanction Zimbabwe.
“This is the only veto that China executed on an African country.”
The ambassador also touched on the recent citrus protocol signed by Zimbabwe and China, saying opportunities to export fresh produce were available but it was up to Zimbabweans to not only boost production, but also avail quality produce.
“Actually, Zimbabwe has done well, you’re much better than other African countries because I have read the data that trade volumes between our countries are US$2,4 billion.”
“Our recent citrus agreement will further enhance your exports to China but on the basis that you have to compete very well with South Africa.
“I think that it’s on your side to produce high quality, quantity and be competitive. Small quantities for Chinese trade dealers are not profitable so we are ready but African countries should make themselves ready.”
The agreement has allowed 11 citrus orchards and six citrus pack houses access to export to China.

Minister Shamu said it was important to instill in citizens and the journalism fraternity progressive values anchored on clear appreciation of national history and cultural heritage so that they appropriately exercise citizen journalism.
The minister said this during a meeting with Deputy Minister of the State Counsel Information Office of China, Mr Qian Xiaoqian, who is in the country for a familiarisation visit.
Minister Shamu said there should be leverage on social media for the people’s good.
“However, it is also important to note that if not wisely utilised and appropriately regulated, these platforms can be a cause of strife in society.
“The so-called citizen journalism facet of the new media means everyone has the potential to disseminate information that is not sometimes inaccurate or undesirable, information which may indeed be in total disregard of the national interest and lead to uncalled for internal strife in a country,” said Minister Shamu.
“Self-censorship, which is a cornerstone in sensible dissemination of information in both the traditional and new media, assumes an abundance of progressive thought in society.”
The minister commended the good bilateral relations between Zimbabwe and China saying Beijing has always supported Harare in the wake of the onslaught by the West.
Zimbabwe, said Minister Shamu, recognised Beijing as the legitimate government of mainland China and Taiwan.
“We support your country on the One China Policy and we continue to plead with our sister countries in the Sadc region to do the same. China should safeguard its territory and national unity by preventing Taiwan from being separated from the mainland. We support your principle of one country, two systems,” he said.
Mr Qian said China would continue to support Zimbabwe, particularly in condemning the illegal sanctions against Harare.
“We will continue calling for the sanctions removal,” he said.
Mr Qian and his delegation latter visited the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Holdings and held a meeting with parastatal’s management led by Mr Happison Muchechetere.
They also visited Zimpapers where they held a meeting with the company’s editors and senior executives led by the group chief executive officer, Mr Justin Mutasa.

Zimbabwe,1251,zimbabwesituation.com,2013-09-16T21:12:04Z,Why China is making a big play to control Africa's media,"When one of South Africa’s biggest newspaper chains was sold last month, an odd name was buried in the list of new owners: China International Television Corp.
A major stake in a South African newspaper group might seem an unusual acquisition for Chinese state television, but it was no mystery to anyone who has watched the rapid expansion of China’s media empire across Africa.
From newspapers and magazines to satellite television and radio stations, China is investing heavily in African media. It’s part of a long-term campaign to bolster Beijing’s “soft power” – not just through diplomacy, but also through foreign aid, business links, scholarships, training programs, academic institutes and the media.
Its investments have allowed China to promote its own media agenda in Africa, using a formula of upbeat business and cultural stories and a deferential pro-government tone, while ignoring human-rights issues and the backlash against China’s own growing power.
The formula is a familiar one used widely in China’s domestic media. It leads to a tightly controlled pro-China message, according to journalists and ex-journalists at the Africa branch of CCTV, the Chinese state television monopoly that owns China International Television and launched a new headquarters in Nairobi last year.
“It was ‘our way or the highway,’” recalls a journalist who worked in Ethiopia for CCTV. He said he was ordered to focus primarily on diplomatic negotiations over Sudan, with his bosses citing “China’s interest in the region” – a reference to China’s state oil companies and their heavy investments in Sudan.
Other CCTV Africa journalists say they were told to provide positive news on China, to omit negative words such as “regime,” and to ignore countries such as Swaziland that have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Chinese demand for ivory could not be mentioned in stories about Africa’s poaching crisis, one journalist said. Another recalled how human-rights questions had to be avoided in an interview with an authoritarian African leader. “I knew it would be cut out of my story, so I self-censored,” he said.
The journalists asked not to be named for fear of repercussions.
If there is an “information war” between China and the United States on an African battleground, as former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested at a Congressional committee hearing in 2011, it appears that China is beginning to win the war.
In South Africa, Chinese investors have teamed up with allies of the ruling African National Congress to purchase Independent News and Media, one of the most powerful media groups in the country, which owns daily newspapers in all of the major cities.
The deal was spearheaded by Iqbal Surve, a businessman with close African National Congress connections who says he wants the media to report more “positive aspects” of the country. Financing was provided by state investment groups from China and South Africa, along with Mr. Surve’s consortium. Top leaders of the ANC helped put together the Chinese investors with Mr. Surve’s group, analysts said.
Under the deal, China International Television and the China-Africa Development Fund, both controlled by Beijing, will end up with 20 per cent of the newspaper chain – a stake that will allow them to materially influence the company, according to South Africa’s Competition Commission.
Even though South Africa’s feisty journalists will push back against any attempt to censor them, China is still likely to end up with more power to shape the media in Africa’s wealthiest country.
“I do not think the Chinese authorities will crudely impose their views on our media, as they do on much of their own, but I do think that they are likely to try and influence it for a more sympathetic view of themselves and the ANC government,” said Anton Harber, a journalism professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, who has reported extensively on the Chinese investments.
“It is my view that the ANC is working with their Chinese allies – ruling party to ruling party, in the way the Chinese government so often works – to increase their influence in our local media and counter what they view as a hostile media sector.”
Meanwhile, other Chinese media investors are gaining a bigger foothold across Africa. A Chinese company, StarTimes, purchased a controlling stake in South African satellite television provider TopTV this year, adding to its presence in 13 other African countries. The state-run radio broadcaster, China Radio International, has FM stations in three East African cities, while its AM channel covers all of Kenya.
China’s leading English-language state newspaper, China Daily, created an Africa edition last December, published in Nairobi and distributed on Kenya Airways flights and other venues. China has also launched a monthly magazine, ChinAfrica, based in Johannesburg.
China’s state news agency, Xinhua, has nearly 30 bureaus in Africa, along with its own television channel. It provides news bulletins for 17-million Kenyan cellphones, while CCTV provides a mobile TV service called I Love Africa. African journalists and press officers are often invited on all-expenses-paid “training” sessions in Beijing, as part of Chinese aid programs that give short-term training to 30,000 Africans and full university scholarships to another 18,000.
In Zimbabwe, CCTV provided new equipment for the state television monopoly, allowing it to broadcast President Robert Mugabe’s campaign rallies for many hours during the July election campaign. China also supplied giant television screens for Zimbabwe’s main cities, so that government information could be broadcast on the streets.
The centrepiece of China’s media empire is its new CCTV hub in Nairobi and its flagship show, Africa Live. With its staff of about 100 people (about 40 of whom are Chinese), and correspondents in 14 bureaus, the show is intended to compete with BBC and CNN.
Top executives of CCTV in Nairobi declined requests for an interview. But speaking on condition of anonymity, their journalists said the Africa headquarters is extremely well-financed, with state-of-the-art equipment and salaries double the Kenyan norm.
Its content, however, is often simplistic and condescending. It produced a documentary, for example, called Glamorous Kenya that portrayed the country as “a land of mystery” and “kingdom of animals.” It gives consistently glowing coverage of Chinese trade and aid in Africa, including frequent stories about the two dozen Confucius Institutes that provide Chinese language training across Africa.
News scripts are carefully vetted by Chinese editors, the journalists say, and there are instructions to avoid any negative coverage of Chinese leaders at summits. Some journalists are docked pay if their reports are considered “poor.”
When a CCTV reporter quoted Zambian mine workers who were angry at their Chinese employer, his story was shelved. And when Muslims protested against the Ethiopian government, the CCTV correspondent wondered whether to cover the street protests. His bosses swiftly vetoed it. “No religion,” they said.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa'], 'ETH': ['Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia'], 'SDN': ['Republic of the Sudan'], 'SWZ': ['Eswatini'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'KEN': ['Republic of Kenya', 'Nairobi']}",media_campaign_intervention,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Deputy Minister Supa Mandiwanzira has said content development should be a major priority for Africa ahead of next year’s digitalisation deadline. Chairing a session on Media Exchange and Co-operation between China and African countries in Beijing yesterday, Deputy Minister Mandiwanzira said the programmes would only be balanced if Africa produced excellent quality local content.
“Digitalisation is bringing with it a proliferation of television channels,” he said.
“These channels could serve as a platform for cultural colonisation through foreign content unless all of us in Africa embark on an aggressive initiative to promote the production of quality indigenous content.”
Deputy Minister Mandiwanzira is in China to attend the Second Forum on China-Africa Media Co-operation which opened yesterday and is being held two years after the successful inaugural one in 2012.
The forum seeks to deepen exchanges and co-operation in the sector covering the spheres of press, publications, radio, film and television between China and African countries.
Government ministers and media executives from 40 African countries are attending.
“It is commendable that China continues to take this noble initiative to promote media cooperation with the continent,” said Deputy Minister Mandiwanzira.
“The significant coverage of Africa by CCTV is bringing balance to the global media coverage of Africa which for long has been dominated by Western TV networks with their naked agendas bent on characterising Africa as a failed continent.
“That this forum is exploring further co-operation on content exchange with China, it’s important that China assists with building production capacity in Africa or else the co-operation will soon appear to be one-sided.”
He said Zimbabwe was grateful to China for the donation of a state-of-the art television outside-broadcast van delivered last year.
The Chinese government has also offered to roll-out analogue to digital migration in Harare and Bulawayo in return to carrying CCTV on the digital platform.

Zimbabwe is being represented at the global beauty pageant by Miss World Zimbabwe Annie-Grace Mutambu (19), who will fight it out with 116 other beauties from all over the world.
The winner will take over the crown from reigning Miss World, Rolene Strauss of South Africa.
The Chinese government blocked access to Facebook in the Asian country as part of its Internet censorship policy following the July 2009 Ürümqi riots after Xinjiang independence activists used Facebook as part of their communications network.
The Chinese government alleged that these social networking platforms were being used to co-ordinate protests in Xinjiang, and to spread rumours harmful to the State.
According to the Miss World Facebook page, however, the lifting of the ban was a result of the Chinese government’s deep involvement in the pageant with its grand finale to be held on December 19 at the Crown of Beauty Theatre in Sanya, China.
The ban suspension will hold until December 19.
“The Chinese President, and his family, joins the opening ceremony of Miss World every time the competition is held in the country,” read part of the statement on the Miss World Facebook page.
According to the Miss World website, the contestants would experience the exotic wonders of Sanya and Hainan Island, where they will compete in the Miss World Challenge Events ahead of the final contest.
Miss Zimbabwe Trust spokesperson Tendai Chirau told NewsDay that they had done their best in terms of grooming, as Mutambu went through a lot of routines.

Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Minister Dr Christopher Mushohwe has warned students going to study in China of the strict rules against social media surfing obtaining in that country and that they should behave.
The country has no Internet privacy. Posts are easily traceable. Addressing 49 students selected to undertake undergraduate studies at Ocean University in China, Minister Mushohwe implored them to obey that country’s laws and the university’s rules.
He said China has a population of more than 1,4 billion with over 700 million nationals hooked on the Internet. “Unfortunately, for you, you are not like students, who go to countries like South Africa and other countries,” said Minister Mushohwe. “China is a much disciplined country. You will never find one small stupid item on the social media in China. It is not possible.
“It is not possible that you can read anything on social media, which will talk ill of the Chinese leadership, even newspapers will not write negative things about the leadership.”
The minister said China has many students studying abroad, but when they are back in their country they adhere to their values. “That is how patriotic the Chinese are,” said Minister Mushohwe.
He said the situation was totally different in Zimbabwe where the social media was giving him serious headaches as the responsible authority of the sector.
“In Zimbabwe we have serious problems with social media, but we have not more than 1,5 million people hooked on the Internet as opposed to more than 700 million in China,” he said.
“We get serious headaches and for me, who is responsible for the ministry, you can imagine my problems.” He said almost on daily basis he receives complaints from people, who would be abused on the social media. “Please I know that you are very active on social media,” he said.
“They do not apply in China. Do not make the mistake of uploading things that are not acceptable in China. If you write things that are not acceptable China system will pick every little things you put on your social media platform”

Matika was ordered to report once every fortnight at Luveve Police Station as part of the bail conditions.
She was also ordered to surrender her passport and to continue residing at her given address until the matter is finalised.
The State, which was represented by Mr Terrence Chakanyuka did not oppose the bail application.
Mr Chakanyuka said on April 10, Matika allegedly published a false Press statement purporting to have been issued and signed by the President.
The false statement with the President’s fake signature, was extending the lockdown period by 13 days from April 20 to May 3 2020.
“Accused person then circulated the fake document on different WhatsApp platforms using her cellphone, Huawei with Econet line and also forwarded the fake message to her daughter Renah Muhambi,” said Mr Chakanyuka.
According to the State, President Mnangagwa did not originate or sign the said fake statement.
Matika’s daughter and their accomplice Prisca Gumbo (44) of Mpopoma suburb have since appeared in court. They were both released on bail.
Spreading fake news on social media and mainstream media about Covid-19 has been categorised as a Level 14 offence, the highest in the country and people convicted of the crime face up to 20 years in jail.
Recently, President Mnangagwa warned peddlers of falsehoods regarding Covid-19 issues saying they face a 20-year jail term if convicted. — @mashnets",0,,,"{'ZWE': ['Bulawayo', 'Cowdray Park', 'Luveve', 'Mpopoma']}",media_campaign_intervention,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei']
Zimbabwe,13607,zimbabwesituation.com,2022-06-26T13:48:46Z,Corruption watch: Chinese embassy has gone rogue,"Where propaganda using the Zimbabwean media is concerned, boy oh boy, China is on steroids and will not be tiring any time soon.
By definition and description, propaganda is information with a purpose, the purpose to influence opinion and perception.
You need propaganda the same way you would oxygen if things are not going right for you.
If you are suffering from acute paranoia and you are just too anxious to be heard and to make a statement.
If you have lots of bad things to hide. So, in this sense, propaganda becomes some kind of compensatory behaviour.
It’s not like all forms of propaganda are lies, no.
Some of the information is actually true, some partially true, but the rest are a plain mound of lies and falsehoods.
There are favourite words to use these days where the last is concerned.
Disinformation and misinformation.
When it comes to China in Zimbabwe, the whole thing is so funny.
You just need to listen to how the Chinese embassy and its typical hangers-on are busy accusing other people of fake news, disinformation and misinformation in the same foul breath that they are doing exactly like that themselves.
There is so much that’s just not right with Chinese investments in Zimbabwe and Beijing’s relations with the Zimbabwean government.
The Zimbabwean elite is parceling out all manner of contracts to their imagined “all-weather friends”.
Nothing wrong with giving Chinese investors and proxy companies of Beijing contracts.
It’s simply that the contracts are mired in secrecy.
Where there is opacity, corruption thrives.
And that’s exactly what we are seeing and have been seeing for a long, long time.
The privileged elite from Zimbabwe is taking advantage of the secrecy to do fraudulent and criminal deals with the Chinese.
Forget this talk about foreign direct investment from China.
There is nothing like that. On a scale of one to 10, the Chinese are not investing in Zimbabwe.
They are just coming to milk our resources and take the proceeds back home.
If you move around Zimbabwe today and you are objective about it, you get this extremely sad feeling that, in the next 15 to 20 years, nothing will be left of Zimbabwe.
The only thing that the Chinese will not be able to take out is the air, but then, they are already making it too dirty to breathe.
Just move around Mutoko, for instance, and you will go back home wondering if, given the energy of the Chinese miners, there will be any gold or granite left in a few years to come.
There is talk of discoveries of lithium in that area, too.
The dragons are circling for the kill.
The local leadership is too happy with that because, if it’s not them that are benefiting directly, it’s their sons, girlfriends and cronies.
Not to talk of the usual stuff.
Serious environmental degradation, displacements, rampant abuse of workers with impunity, disrespect for local cultures and traditions, bribery, you name it.
In the midst of these ills, China has seen that it must do serious propaganda in Zimbabwe.
The messaging is predictable. It involves cooking up all sorts of conspiracy theories against the critics of Chinese investments and Sino-Zim relations.
In this regard, everyone who criticises Chinese investments and relations with the Zimbabwean elite has been sent by Washington and a select number of other western governments.
They are on western payrolls.
China must take the cup for being just about the most foul-mouthed diplomatic mission in Zimbabwe and, of course, other areas where Chinese interests are receiving critical reviews.
If you have a dim view of how Chinese enterprises and the embassy are doing their business in Zimbabwe, just make sure you have the strongest shock absorbers against the vitriol, name calling and hate speech.
Together with their local accomplices, they will call you a money-mongering good-for-nothing agent of regime change at the drop of a scarf.
The arrogance and impunity are so crass.
And, you guessed right, nothing happens to them because they enjoy the proximity to selfish and greedy power.
To do this, the Chinese have found willing pawns in some parts of the Zimbabwean media.
Quite unfortunately—but predictably—they abuse the public media.
If they feel like shouting at you or smearing you, they will go to the government-controlled media.
There, they have a blank cheque.
They will just issue vitriolic statements and foist them on the public newsrooms.
No matter how defamatory their statements are, the official media will just reproduce the froth and sometimes even put it on the front page for a good measure.
The statements, again, are predictable.
Hate speech, conspiracies, name calling and all sorts of other unpleasant things. Very false information in there too.
This, naturally, tends to have a bad bearing on the ethics of the profession of journalism.
The official media habitually don’t care about what’s right or wrong.
They will publish damning information about you and don’t even bother talking to you or verifying what they have been given.
In other cases, nameless journalists—shameless gutter journalists to be more precise—cook up stories and send them to the editors at the public media.
Because the content is pro-China, no problem.
This strategy is successful for the Chinese because the official media is so, so manipulated by the elite, which, as already said, is eating with Chinese investors et cetera.
It’s been like that for a long time. The public media don’t enjoy editorial independence.
But that’s also because some journalists from the public media are getting bribes from the Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe.
There is a budget for that at the embassy.
In other words, China is promoting brown envelope journalism in Zimbabwe.
That becomes an irony considering how the Chinese embassy habitually fumes and foams about independent journalists being paid by imaginary western sources to criticise Chinese interests.
That the independent journalists are objective and factual—as they are most of the time—doesn’t matter at all.
The Chinese embassy is always whimpering about sponsored journalists.
Don’t worry with that crap.
It knows full well that that’s exactly what it’s always doing but hoping people won’t know.
There is a growing trend whereby the embassy is funding online media outlets.
These include a fairly new platform called Review&Mail whose founder recently gave his kid a Chinese name, has been doing PR for the embassy and calls himself an “expert on Zim-China affairs”.
This particular platform receives salaries, equipment and other forms of support from the Chinese embassy.
It wasn’t going to be a bother if the Review&Mail was doing PR-based propaganda for the embassy.
You can’t be faulted for that.
The problem with this publication is that it has got into the habit of spreading falsehoods just so as to please the master.
So, what this online news blog does is that it writes its brazen lies and, because it’s still unknown, hands the content over to the official media for the reinforcement of the lies, the propaganda.
Some of the content goes to Xinhua, a news outlet run by the Chinese government.
But, surely, if the Chinese embassy was smart enough, it should demand a refund from the Review&Mail.
That platform is doing a shoddy hatchet job in its quest to please the master and justify continuing getting more money from Chinese taxpayers.
Like, recently, it carried this load of gook about how an independent journalist “lied” in her story.
What happened is that the Chinese embassy gave money to some propaganda journalists to go to Hwange to counter the story that was commissioned by my organisation, Information for Development Trust.
What does this team do when it gets to Hwange?
The worker who was quoted exposing Chinese labour abuses is forced to appear before the Chinese managers where the “journalists” have been planted and later claim critical independent journalists are spreading lies about Chinese investments Such a naïve fallacy!
That guy needs his job.
He was fired at one time for an altercation with a Chinese manager who sprinkled water on him and later assaulted and injured him.
So, what do you expect him to say?
Of course, he denies saying the things—true things—he said in the first place.
He was being subjected to smart duress.
Funny thing is that the Review&Mail went ahead and called what it did in connivance with the Chinese, an investigation, when it was, in fact, journalistic fraud.
After that, the online publication gave the story to one of the public newspapers that did an equally despicable propaganda job that a Martian would not believe even after a crate of the local brew.
The embassy also uses its Twitter account to enhance its propaganda.
The tweets are mostly against other foreign governments and critics of Chinese interests.
Here, it pays jobless and under-employed youths, among them journalists, to troll perceived foes.
Once the embassy posts something, the trolls take it up and bring the war to your doorstep, literally.
For the uninitiated, these trolls are “patriotic” Zimbabweans defending Sino-Zim relations, but the real truth lies elsewhere.
So, social media has become another tool for Beijing to do its vicious and paranoid propaganda.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Mutoko'], 'USA': ['Washington']}",media_campaign_intervention,"['Chinese', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Chinese']","['Chinese', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Zimbabwe,3860,theindependent.co.zw,2015-03-13T07:49:56Z,Chinese firm poised for ZBC digitalisation,"CHINESE information and communications technology company, Huawei is the front-runner in the digitalisation of state broadcaster ZBC in a tender process that is fraught with allegations of irregularities.
Herbert Moyo
Zimbabwe is among a host of countries in the southern African region battling to meet the June 27 deadline for the migration to digital from analogue broadcasting.
Government sources last week told the Zimbabwe Independent that officials from the Information, Media and Broadcasting Services ministry have indicated that they prefer Huawei to undertake the digitalisation project.
“Senior Information ministry officials are so keen on Huawei that they are prepared to flout normal tender procedures to ensure they succeed. They are even scouting for two companies who do not meet the requisite specifications to rope into the tender process so that there is a semblance of legality to the bid,” said a senior government official. “Huawei is also pulling out all stops to ensure it is awarded the tender and has even offered to carry out the feasibility study for free.”
Officials at Huawei’s Harare offices last week referred all questions to a Chinese official they identified as Lightman.
But Lightman could not be reached all week, except once when he said he could not comment because he was at the South African embassy in Harare applying for a visa.
Information Minister Jonathan Moyo also did not respond to calls and messages sent to his mobile phone and email last week. Government sources, however, said the preference for the Chinese company also stems from government’s precarious financial position which has seen grants to ZBC dwindling over the years, resulting in failure to pay workers’ salaries, poor equipment and programmes, among a host of tough challenges.
Last year, then acting ZBC chief executive officer Allan Chiweshe warned of the likelihood of missing the June 2015 digitalisation deadline, saying this could only be averted if government steps in with the necessary financial support.
“We need government support if we are to meet the international digitalisation deadline of 2015. We have already missed the Sadc deadline of 2013. If we miss the 2015 deadline, we will be switched off. There will be no ZBC,” Chiweshe told the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Media.

Three university students joined the seventh edition of the global Huawei ICT competition which aims to cultivate ICT talent within Zimbabwe and foster national development.
Speaking at the Huawei ICT send-off held in Harare yesterday, Enterprise solutions manager of Huawei Tafadzwa Muriritirwa said they were excited to be part of this competition.
“Three high-performing best students were selected after regional level online exams to represent at the final global level, two best students from University of Zimbabwe and the other one from TelOne Centre for Learning were selected.”
The Huawei ICT competition was seen as a great opportunity for the students to secure as much knowledge as possible so as to contribute to the economy of Zimbabwe.
This was revealed by Minister of Information Communication Technology and Courier Services Jenfan Muswere who graced the occasion.
“The purpose of the send-off is to appreciate the role of ICT Huawei and that the students are involved in terms of innovation and grasp knowledge, our expectation is to raise the Zimbabwean flag high through innovation, it’s also an opportunity for Zimbabweans to be able to gain the necessary skills to build functional digital systems.”
Minister Muswere challenged the students to make use of the opportunity rendered in a quest to develop the country.
“Ensure to be ICT soldiers, as Zimbabweans we want to have software side and manufacture ICT home-based solutions that contributes to the economy of Zimbabwe”, he said.
Beneficiaries expressed gratitude saying the competition is of significance in attaining knowledge.
Tinashe Mahweku, a final year student at the University of Zimbabwe pursuing electronic and telecommunications said he was appreciative of the opportunity rendered.

Zimbabwe,1482,theindependent.co.zw,2013-11-08T02:00:26Z,Network providers push growth in data business,"AFTER clinging on to traditional practices of focusing on voice revenues, Zimbabwe’s three mobile phone network providers are visibly warming up to international trends with the players pushing growth in their data businesses.
Staff Writer.
Apart from data, other overlay services such as mobile money transfer platforms and value added products are beginning to get attention by operators, much to the benefit of consumers.
Zimbabwe’s mobile penetration rate stands at 98% while internet permutation rate is at 47% giving more room for business to push their products.
Last week,the country’s largest mobile company, Econet Wireless (Econet), said it had a strategy to grow overlay and non-voice operations as a means to drive revenue growth going forward.
“Our business growth strategy will see us increase data capacity and capability as well as stimulating usage of data through new products which will be unveiled,” Mboweni said.
He said the move was informed by global research which notes that data revenues will contribute more than SMS and MMS by 2017 and voice revenues will be less than 50% of gross revenues at the time.
“The contribution of voice revenues to mobile operators is expected to decline. Data or broadband is expected to grow exponentially and overlays are also expected to make a significant contribution,” Mboweni said in a presentation.
Econet has embarked on a drive to improving smartphone penetration to drive data usage.
The company in partnership with a Chinese multinational networking and telecommunications equipment and services company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd this weekend launched a variety of affordable high speed smart phones and tablets.
Mboweni said Econet is also investing in reliable high speed internet with the widest coverage and robust infrastructure unparalleled by any other operator.
In a half year results presentation for the period to August 2013, Econet said data users had grown by 52% year-on-year on its network from 2,5 to 3,8 million users with over 60% growth in usage per subscriber having been registered.
The company has introduced smart bundles which have seen users enjoying data usage at cheaper rates. Econet subscribers can now also use data to make voice calls at more than half the normal costs of voice calls.
Econet, through its subsidiary Liquid Telecom, has successfully over 4 500km of fibre in Zimbabwe and is putting fibre connectivity to residential suburbs in order to increase home internet usage.
The second largest network provider Telecel last month reduced from US$30 to US$25 the cost of its data dongle to enable more people to access data from their computer affordably and conveniently by taking advantage of Telecel’s fast data speeds and affordable data bundles.
The gadget is high speed to allow for optimal download and upload speeds and comes with 300MB of data and 30 SMSs already pre-loaded.
Telecel also has new super voice bundles for 90 minutes at 50 US cents and 200 minute bundle for US $1. The data package means subscribers can call for as little as 1 US cent per minute. The mobile company also has Telecel red handset deals where it is pushing smartphones and tablets which can be bought on 11 and 24 month plans.
State owned NetOne is giving stiff competition, giving its subscribers broadband internet access and beyond at low prices ranging from as low as 2,5 US cents per megabyte to 4,3 US cents per megabyte and lasting between 30 and 120 days depending on the amount of data purchased.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'USA': ['United States']}",tech_transfer_investment,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei']
Zimbabwe,3938,herald.co.zw,2015-04-29T00:00:49Z,"Embrace ICT in structures, govts told","Happiness Zengeni in Cape Town
Good data management can help governments across Africa to provide trends, forecasts and facilitate rapid urbanisation. This can, however, be made possible if the same governments fully embrace ICT in their structures.
Industry experts at the ongoing Huawei Safe City Africa Summit in Cape Town all emphasised the need to reinforce city safety and in the process reduce crimes through establishing innovative ICT safe city solutions.
Forrester Research Principal Analyst Jennifer Belissent said the first step that is required is for governments to be aware of what is going on in the various cities.
“This can be done through the installation of cameras, sensors, networks, metres and GPS as they help in gathering the data,” she said.
Once the data is gathered it can then be analysed and action taken.
Ms Belissent said simple things such as car number plates can help in preventing crimes or “to find stolen cars.
This can be integrated with other data services and enable them to track unlicenced drivers, or cars without insurance.”
In Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, Zinara and CVR recently integrated its systems to allow the tracking of vehicles that have irregular registrations or failed to pay customs duty upon importation.
The system has already successfully flashed out vehicles that were not on the national vehicle registration database, those that have been imported but not yet registered and those with expired licence discs.
Ms Belissent said urbanisation means that a growing population depends on cities to meet their social, environmental and economic needs.
Safety is fundamental to those needs, and public safety is a concern of city leaders — whether it’s preventing crime, reducing infant mortality or mitigating the effects of natural disasters.
Better access to data and new analytic tools makes that job easier. A safe city not only improves live-ability, but also encourages economic growth and ensures sustainable development. And, that makes safety a key element of any smart city. “
Huawei Technologies South Africa director Wireless Solutions director Rose Moyo however, said technology does not replace the process but (in terms of unusual events) it allows monitoring before, during and after the incident.
She said CCTV cameras help in monitoring an area before something like an accident happens while rapid response will be given during the incident. “The case can therefore be easily solved using the data that would have been collected.
The acceleration of global urbanisation and the proliferation of the internet will drive the convergence of ICT and urban infrastructure.
Countries worldwide are actively formulating plans for the development of safe and smart cities to seize new opportunities generated by global urbanisation.
At the Summit, safe city project leaders from many countries including Madagascar, Kenya, Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Kingdom shared their experience on ICT best practices to enhance public safety with innovative ICT.
Mr Randimbisoa Blaise Richard, Minister of Public Safety of Madagascar, said: “As a multicultural country, Madagascar has gone to great efforts to meet the increasing requirements of economic growth and social stability triggered by the acceleration of globalisation.
Our major responsibilities are to maintain social order and combat crime, working to ensure that Madagascar is a safe country to live, travel, and invest in.
To this end, we chose to co-operate with Huawei and adopt its safe city solution to protect both the lives and property of our residents, leveraging Huawei’s cutting-edge technology and consummate service in 2013.”
Mr Richard Chace, chairman of the Global Security Industry Alliance (GSIA), shared his insights from the perspective of global safe city standards and trends.
He said: “I’m very focused on how urbanisation trends around the world are driving the specification and implementation of safe city technologies and solutions.
“I feel very strongly that successful safe city programmes build heavily on well developed public-private partnerships that are designed to be “win-win”.
“The best use of technology is the one driven by sound planning that first seeks to define problems and then match the right manageable solutions for the long term.”
With a focus on ICT infrastructure, Huawei innovates with its partners and customers to provide a one-stop safe city solution.
Huawei also provides services to government customers though channel partners including Telkom, MIS (PTY), REUTECH, IRT, and Mustek.
Justin Schmidt, executive manager of Hexagon Ventures, discussed how Huawei and Hexagon have developed the industry’s first joint safe city solution which fully meets business needs for city safety management.
He said: “For the first time, the majority of the world’s population lives in cities and this is putting pressure on cities to provide a safe environment for their citizens.
“Hexagon and Huawei are meeting this global challenge head-on with integrated safe city solution that enables cities to determine threats, resolve crises more easily through collaborative efforts and resolve issues with intelligent analysis of big data.”

Under the deal, the two companies will offer smart batteries and solar power products under the Huawei Smart Energy Fusion. The product will initially be rolled out in selected DPA markets such as Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa and Kenya.
“We are always looking to work with innovative partners like Huawei to bring smart systems and deliver best fit energy solutions to meet the energy needs in our markets,” DPA CEO, Norman Moyo, said.
According to DPA, Huawei is offering DPA a solution that ensures up to 30% more energy, more stable power supply and a financial saving for end users.
Under Covid-19, demand has increased for a reliable power service to home offices in order to support the “new reality” remote working.
“The Huawei Smart Energy Fusion product brings customers convenience at a low cost to their daily business and lives,” DPA said.
With the Huawei Smart Energy Fusion product, DPA will be able to increase power capacity for customers wanting to scale up. The product is designed with string battery technology that is scalable from 5kW to 30kW on every stack, giving customers flexible investment. It can be installed with or without solar panels and connected to either grid or generator to supply optimum power.
Demand for renewable energy has increased in Zimbabwe as homeowners and large businesses go green to counter erratic power supply. Government has since slashed duty on solar products in order to encourage uptake and help ease pressure on the power utility.
In March last year, Zimbabwe launched the National Renewable Energy Policy and the Biofuels Policy of Zimbabwe, hoping to attract investment. — newZWire",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'ZMB': ['Republic of Zambia'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa']}",tech_transfer_investment,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei']
Zimbabwe,9366,zimbabwesituation.com,2018-04-26T09:42:53Z,Govt releases $6m for digitisation project,"GOVERNMENT has released $6 million to the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ) to complete the digitisation project amid reports that most transmission sites countrywide are ready for migration from analogue to digital. This follows the disbursement of another $6 million at the beginning of this year as part of the $22 million allocated to the project in the 2018 National Budget.
Secretary for Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Mr George Charamba yesterday toured Chibondo transmission site outside Hwange.
He said going forward, only local engineers will be contracted to finish outstanding work after a successful skills transfer through the Huawei contract.
The Chinese contractor will now be limited to providing equipment while local engineers will do footing and installations at base stations, Mr Charamba said.
We have been favoured with $6 million by Government so we can do seven new sites that’s in Buhera, Chikombedzi, Gutu, Kwekwe, Maphisa, Murehwa and Nembudziya. We may get an extra $4 million before the end of the first half of the year,” said Mr Charamba.
He said less than 30 local engineers were now engaged in the project from the initial 32.
“The project has been running for three years where we contracted Huawei. The idea was to surround the Chinese with local engineers for skills transfer and now we are at a stage where the digital programme is moving directly with Huawei as a material supplier only.
“They contracted Zambians and we made a very clear statement that they can’t import labour. For the remaining sites we will not use Huawei as we have changed the contract because we have acquired skills we wanted.
“Installation of the transmitters will be done by us and we can now pat our backs because the objective has been achieved,” said Mr Charamba.
The permanent secretary said the development has cost cutting benefits and also reduces pressure of looking for foreign currency to pay the contractor.
Government targets to build 48 transmitters, 24 new and an equal number being upgrades of existing infrastructure countrywide.
Among those that are ready are Kamativi whose installation is almost complete, Manjolo in Binga, Kenmaur in Lupane and Chibondo in Hwange where radio signals have been activated.
Mr Charamba said despite benefiting on skills development, the project, which still needs $103 million, was still facing financial challenges compounded by foreign currency shortage to acquire new equipment.
He said the money was needed to buy transmitters and other gadgets while the initial targeted 12 new stations have been increased to 24.
For the first time, some parts of Matabeleland North around Hwange, Binga and Lupane have started receiving radio transmission following the switching on of three stations at the Kamativi and Kenmaur sites.
The stations now reaching the province are Sport FM, Radio Zimbabwe and National FM while engineers said three more, Power FM, Star FM and ZiFM will be switched on next week to bring them to six.
As for Victoria Falls, Mr Charamba said there was still debate on whether to erect a new site or ride on existing ones run by mobile telecommunication companies to avoid breaching International Telecommunication Union regulations by encroaching into Zambia.
BAZ chief executive Engineer Obert Muganyuri said some equipment had already been acquired following release of the funds as the project targets to have at least 28 sites ready by year end.

Huawei, which has a massive global imprint including in Zimbabwe, is leading the world towards the adoption of super-fast Internet technologies.
Mr Ramaphosa was speaking at the 4IRSA digital economy summit in Johannesburg, where he outlined his government’s strategy to unlock economic opportunities in the digital era. Near the end of his speech, the President turned his attention to multilateral relations, which he said should also reflect an enabling posture for the global digital economy. Mr Ramaphosa said the US action against Huawei was an example of protectionism which would affect South Africa’s telecommunications sector.
“This standoff between China and the US, where the technology company Huawei is being used as victim because of its successes is an example of protectionism that will affect our own telecommunications sector, particularly the efforts to roll out the 5G network, causing a setback on other networks as well,” he said.
He said a number of telecommunication companies had written to him to express their concerns about trade restrictions that had been imposed on Huawei by the US government. “Telecom companies got together and wrote me a letter saying that this tussle between the US and China around the company called Huawei is going to hurt us because we can’t go to 5G, and only Huawei can lead us to 5G,” said Mr Ramaphosa.
With the trade discussions between the US and China set to resume, Mr Ramaphosa said the Chinese telecom giant was a victim.
“We support a company that is going to take our country and indeed the world to better technologies, and that is 5G.

Zimbabwe,11594,theindependent.co.zw,2020-05-15T07:40:36Z,Smart cities need smart legal framework,"On May 4, 2020, Technomag, an online magazine, published an article stating that plans to install surveillance cameras in Harare were at an advanced stage.
According to the same article, this is part of the National Smart City initiative spearheaded by the Ministry of Information Communication Technology and Cybersecurity.

This initiative will see cities such as Harare partner with Chinese company Huawei to install closed circuit television cameras (CCTV) as a way to promote safety within the city’s perimeter.
At a global level, the smart city concept is based on the use of various technologies to promote public safety, as well as to make a city’s operations and service delivery more efficient. Zimbabwe formally launched its smart city blueprint named the Zimbabwe Smart Sustainable Cities Initiative in March 2018.
The Zimbabwe Smart Sustainable Cities Initiative Green paper lists access to clean water, beautification of the city, improved health delivery, and the establishment of a sufficient public transport as some of the objectives of Zimbabwe’s attempts to create smart cities.
Smart cities by their design are intended to achieve a wide range of sustainable interventions, that include complex processes such as waste management, power distribution, water purification and supply, urban space utilisation, metering and billing services.
The monitoring of traffic is one other common feature that is embodied in smart cities. The deployment of technology is supposed to deliver safer, quick and efficient public services, the supposition being that human beings are incapable of making complex, fast and efficient decisions.
Smart cities require massive data gathering. Therefore various technologies must be deployed in the form of cameras, sensors and other tech related data gathering tools. The collected data is processed and analysed to identify ways in which service delivery, public processes, and resource management may be efficiently carried out.
It is this continuous collection and processing of data that is a cause for concern. The types of data that are collected range from personal information to more sensitive data such as facial, and biometric data. The CCTV cameras installed in Harare are primarily meant to monitor traffic.
The collection and processing of data must be guided by the eight universally protected principles. First, data must be fairly and lawfully processed. At the present moment there is no framework for that in Zimbabwe. Second, the data must be processed for limited purposes and not in any manner incompatible with those purposes.
Without a law, it is difficult to appreciate the extent to which this data will be used for the specific purposes of traffic monitoring. There are already instances of personal data collected for specific purposes being abused.
Third, the collection should be adequate, relevant and not excessive. Fourth, the information collected should be accurate and where necessary, up to date. There are no mechanisms for anyone to appreciate the accuracy of the information being collected and let alone its uses.
Fifth, the data should not be kept for longer than is necessary. Data storage and destruction is critical. Sixth, the data should be processed in line with the data subject’s rights. A data subject is basically every individual that can be identified, directly or indirectly, through data markers or identifiers such as name, geol location data, facial features, genetic makeup.
Data subject rights include, right to access and right to information about the data subject being held by an entity collecting or processing; right to withdraw consent, this consent is assumed right now as no proper consent requests were sent for Hararians; and concomitantly a data subject has the right to object, right to be forgotten.
Eight, for data to be processed well it should be done so securely and lastly personal information should not be transferred to other jurisdictions without adequate protection.
These principles are usually embodied in a country’s data protection and privacy laws. Currently, the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) is the main law used to protect the right to privacy and regulate data protection in Zimbabwe. This Act does little to provide actual guidance on how data collected through a city wide CCTV system should be handled and protected.
This is problematic given the reports that the CCTV cameras supplied by Huawei might have facial recognition capabilities. Facial recognition cameras make it easier to carry out targeted surveillance on any individuals; there is a need to have laws in place to guard against any potential abuse of this technology by the State or any other private entities. Biometric data such as images of an individual’s face or an individual’s fingerprints deserve a higher level of protection because of the sensitive nature of the information.
While Zimbabwe might be able to conduct business of this nature with China and similarly disposed countries, this impacts trade with other economies that have stringent data regulations that advance data subjects rights over political or economic expedience. Chinese companies find themselves mired in controversies of mission creep, abuse of data and furthering state surveillance. The current efforts to move towards smart cities sounds very noble. Sadly constitutional rights protection and sound regulatory frameworks, always appear to be an afterthought under the Second Republic.

Zimbabwe,3811,herald.co.zw,2015-03-19T00:00:30Z,‘Zim to meet digitalisation deadline’,"Prof Moyo
Zvamaida Murwira Senior Reporter—
Zimbabwe is set to meet the June 17, 2015 broadcasting digitalisation deadline after Government secured $200 million through the issuance of Datacasting licence to NetOne to fund the migration from analogue system to digital, a Cabinet Minister told the National Assembly yesterday. Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Minister Professor Jonathan Moyo said the new system would revolutionise the broadcasting sector, one of which would entail a new licence system where receivers would be levied between $3 to $5 access fee per month under a pay per view arrangement.
Also read…
The migration is set to create thousands of jobs in the broadcasting and downstream industries as there will be several broadcasting channels.
Presenting a Ministerial statement in the National Assembly to update the House on the migration project prescribed by the International Telecommunications Union, Professor Moyo said Government found funding through issuance of a Datacasting licence for Digital Dividend.
“The Datacasting Licence was issued to NetOne on 23 December 2014 by the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe at the cost of $200 million after an open, transparent and competitive licensing process in accordance with the Broadcasting Services Act. What this means is that the broadcasting sector has been innovative enough to fund the country’s digital migration. This is commendable given the challenge of competing demands on Treasury,” said Prof Moyo to rousing applause from legislators across the political divide.
Upon securing the $200 million, said Prof Moyo, BAZ engaged a Chinese company, Huawei Technologies, to implement the digital migration on the basis of a feasibility study submitted to Government last year.
Finance and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa signed a Memorandum of Understanding in Beijing on August 2014 during a historic state visit by President Mugabe where several mega deals were signed.
Prof Moyo said the implementation would be done in two phases, with the first one expected to be completed by June 17 2015 involving digitalisation of 30 transmitter sites.
He said BAZ would ensure that there would be no analogue television transmitter along or near the country’s borders to interfere with neighbours, which was the essence of the ITU deadline.
“In this regard Mr Speaker, Honourable Members should take note that the ITU deadline is a ‘Switch Off’, not a ‘Switch on’ deadline. There is therefore no question that we will somehow fail to switch off those analogue television transmitters along or near our borders. In any event, in a number of cases there will be nothing to switch off because there are no analogue television transmitters along or near our borders,” said Prof Moyo.
BAZ, he said, would build six new transmitters in Binga, Chikombedzi, Chipinge, Hwange, Kotwe and Mapisa, areas that would have such gadgets installed for the first time in their history.
Phase two, he said, would involve, among other several things, digitalised 18 new transmitter sites, six ZBC studios, six content production centres, web television system — all to be completed by December 2015, except revamping 25 radio transmitters to be done by end of January 2016.
Government, he said, would secure and subsidise between 300 000 and one million set top-boxes, that is decoders to convert analogue signal to digital for viewing public.
Public broadcasting will move from television licensing regime to a new ICT application where licence fee will be accessed at a fee which was being proposed at between $3 and $5 per month per television set.
“Everyone who watches television will be required to pay an access fee through subscription. This includes those who subscribe to satellite television content such as DSTV. The manual access television license will be retained for those who will choose not to subscribe to any licensed television content but this licence will be at a very high scale to cover the cost of its manual collection,” he said.
Prof Moyo said some of the advantages of digital migration were that the country would have more television broadcasting channels including a public broadcasting channel to be dedicated to the National Assembly covering sittings and that for portfolio committees on a continuous basis.
There would be another frequency available for licensing to at least six private commercial television broadcasters while the fourth would be reserved for future use to be decided by future generations, he said.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Binga', 'Chipinge', 'Chikombozi'], 'CHN': ['Beijing'], 'UGA': ['Kotwe']}",tech_transfer_investment,"['Huawei', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Huawei']","['Huawei', 'Beijing']","['Huawei', 'Beijing']"
Zimbabwe,3935,herald.co.zw,2015-04-29T21:31:09Z,Huawei making Africa a smart continent,"Tonderai Rutsito
Huawei this week demonstrated its technological prowess by unveiling innovative ICT safe city solutions at the Safe City Africa Summit in Cape Town. The technology allows monitoring of incidents in different parts of cities before, during and after through the use of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. The technology is already fully functional in 30 countries serving 400 million citizens in 100 various cities of the world.
With the current speed upgrades by Liquid Telecom, TelOne, Powertel and Telco, Zimbabwe and Harare in particular is now ready for the installation of such a smart and safe system to curb crime and ensure the safety to its citizens.
The technology seamlessly integrates LTE broadband trunking, video surveillance, Unified Communications (UC), and video conferencing systems with a Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system to achieve the visualisation of command and dispatch.
Leveraginmakg, the intelligent video analysis system based on big data, the solution can quickly and precisely extract clues from massive volumes of videos.
This facilitates active prevention before incidents, quick response during incidents and precise retrieval after incidents in public areas.
Huawei, however, highlighted that the decision to install the new technology in Zimbabwe rests with the Government and other stakeholders.
Addressing more than 400 industry members Huawei’s president for Eastern and Southern Africa, Mr Li Peng, said innovative ICT infrastructure is the foundation upon which the safe smart cities is built and their focus is to ensure safe cities in Africa.
“In 2015, the ‘Year of China’ in South Africa, Huawei would like to reiterate our commitment to work hand-in-hand with our partners to provide Africa with innovative one-stop safe city solution. These solutions will help to build safer and more harmonious urban residential, business and tourism environments to attract investment and increase employment for sustainable economic development.
“These solutions will help to build safer and more harmonious urban residential, business and tourism environments to attract investment and increase employment for sustainable economic development,” he said.
The acceleration of global urbanisation and the proliferation of the internet will drive the convergence of ICT and urban infrastructure.
Countries worldwide are actively formulating plans for the development of safe and smart cities to seize new opportunities generated by global urbanisation.
At the summit, safe city project leaders from many countries including Madagascar, Kenya, Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Kingdom shared their experience on ICT best practices to enhance public safety with innovative ICT.
Mr Randimbisoa Blaise Richard, Minister of Public Safety of Madagascar, said: “As a multicultural country, Madagascar has gone to great efforts to meet the increasing requirements of economic growth and social stability triggered by the acceleration of globalisation.
“Our major responsibilities are to maintain social order and combat crime, working to ensure that Madagascar is a safe country to live, travel and invest in.
“To this end, we chose to co-operate with Huawei and adopt its safe city solution to protect both the lives and property of our residents, leveraging Huawei’s cutting-edge technology and consummate service in 2013.”
Mr Richard Chace, chairman of the Global Security Industry Alliance (GSIA), shared his insights from the perspective of global safe city standards and trends.
He said: “I’m very focused on how urbanisation trends around the world are driving the specification and implementation of safe city technologies and solutions.
“I feel very strongly that successful safe city programmes build heavily on well developed public-private partnerships that are designed to be ‘win-win’.
“The best use of technology is the one driven by sound planning that first seeks to define problems and then match the right manageable solutions for the long term.”
Forrester Research principal analyst Ms Jennifer Belissent spoke about the role of ICT solutions in protecting a city’s safety and making cities safer and smarter.
She said: “Urbanisation means that a growing population depends on cities to meet their social, environmental and economic needs. Safety is fundamental to those needs, and public safety is a concern of city leaders — whether it’s preventing crime, reducing infant mortality or mitigating the effects of natural disasters.
“Better access to data and new analytics tools makes that job easier. A safe city not only improves live-ability, but also encourages economic growth and ensures sustainable development. And, that makes safety a key element of any smart city.”

Six of them will be independent. So with regard to the channel holders (broadcasters) we are learning. This goes also to the private telecommunication companies. We are going to put measures to see to it that they operate within the confines of the country’s laws. I won’t reveal now what we are going to do because it will give them time to change systems, but we are going to do something in that regard,” Dr Mushowe said.The Minister said the digitalisation programme was now 25 percent complete.He said there were only two countries in Africa that had moved from analogue to digital, adding that Zimbabwe was on the right track.“We set a date last year but we failed to compete because of financial constraints. But we are now at 25 percent to complete the programme. We are grateful to Huawei of China who have managed to give us equipment to use even if we still owe them $11 million. We are working well with them and that is anchored on the rich history that we share with that country,” said Dr Mushowe.“The licences will be cheaper as compared to Multichoice who came here to make money out of our people. But as government we are here for our people and that will see you paying next to nothing to access channels on ZBC tv.”Dr Mushohwe said every area in the country will receive clear TV signals.“We have places like Gokwe Nembudziya, Manicaland and others which have mountains and digitalisation will help to improve that. After all we will do fill-ins in valleys so that every Zimbabwean has access to local broadcasting stations,” said the Minister.He said content production was a multimillion dollar business which locals, especially the youths, must take advantage of.“The youths must embrace this digitalisation programme. President Mugabe is very worried about the youths. He always wishes well for them each year as they graduate from schools. So this is an opportunity for them to create employment and be their own bosses in content creation for broadcasters,” Dr Mushohwe said, adding that Government will be advocating for 75 percent local content.He said there was a lot of work to be done for the channels that will be operating 24 hours a day.“This is an opportunity for us to rebrand ourselves, rebrand our children, our society because for long we have been watching content from imperialists.It’s high time we rebrand and restore our values as we also make money for economic development at the same time.

Zimbabwe’s economic success hinges on maximum exploitation of information communication and technologies in all facets of the economy, Information Communication and Technology Minister Jenfan Muswere has said.
Minister Muswere revealed this while launching a Huawei ICT competition for 2019/20 in the capital yesterday, where he lauded the organisation (Huawei) for enhancing the ICT ecosystem in the country thereby increasing the possibility of an enhanced virtual community going forward.
Science, technology and innovation have become key factors contributing to economic growth in both advanced and developing economies.
Information and communication technologies (ICT) have been at the heart of economic changes for more than a decade now and they play an important role, notably by contributing to rapid technological progress and productivity growth in agriculture and other key manufacturing sectors.
Minister Muswere, told the participants at the event that ICT had great potential to stimulate economic growth and productivity in major economic sectors and his ministry was working towards the achievement of that objective.
“Indeed, our economic success depends on maximising on our ICTs capabilities. As a ministry, we are developing a digital infrastructure master plan in order to consolidate the utilisation of ICT’s for macroeconomic growth,” said Minister Muswere.
The ICT Minister bemoaned deficiency of investment in this lucrative sector at the same time applauding Huawei’s initiative, which plans to empower youths in ICT related field.
He also hinted on the potential amount of employment creation the sector possessed.
Events of the past week where thousands of people were left stranded as the EcoCash platform collapsed, is evidence of the ICT skills and capacity deficit in the country, calling for major investments in terms of skills and capital investment.
“Some of the challenges facing the ICT sector in Zimbabwe are lack of skilled ICT professionals and investment in the sector.
“It is therefore pleasing to note that supporting skills development is one of Huawei’s key priorities for building an ICT talent ecosystem through seeds for the future in Zimbabwe.
“With the right skills, our people are better prepared to contribute to economic growth, they are better prepared to contribute to economic growth, they have a better chance of securing decent jobs and they are also better equipped to set up their own business and in turn create jobs for others,” he said.
The Huawei ICT competition, which is being run under the theme “Connection, glory, future”, brings together ICT students from several countries to compete for scholarships at China’s top technology universities.
Upon his assumption of office, Minister Muswere pointed out ICT infrastructure development as a priority during his tenure aimed at enhancing connectivity and efficiency of the cyber world in the country.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",tech_transfer_investment,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei']

Speaking after touring broadcasting digitalisation sites in Kotwa and Mutoko in Mashonaland East yesterday Mr Charamba said the delay would not only cost the country demurrage charges as suppliers would levy for storage but would also affect implementation time frame of the digitalisation project.
“We had a slight hitch in respect of payments to the contractor. It had nothing to do with shortage of resources but it had to do with certain preliminary corporate expectations,” said Mr Charamba.
He said the agreement tied his ministry, NetOne and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.
Mr Charamba said there was a delay by the board of NetOne to familiarise itself and appreciate the financial arrangement.
NetOne, he said, had since made a resolution committing itself and the central bank now had necessary documents that would enable it to disburse payments to Huawei, the Chinese contractor.
“The impact of that delay is that we have lost out on implementation schedule.
“We have lots of equipment that should have been shipped from China and other supplying countries to Zimbabwe. That equipment is building up and when it does that, it creates demurrage charges,” he said.
The equipment, he said, was specifically made for a customer hence the contractor was facing problems with suppliers.
“But I am now assured by the RBZ that payment will be resumed shortly and we will pick up pace and make for lost time,” he said.
Mr Charamba expressed satisfaction with civil works that were being carried out on sites.
The Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe chief executive Engineer Obert Muganyura said they had identified new sites for 24 transmitters that ought to be installed.
He said civil works to have access roads were at different levels of completion.
“So far 11 sites have been completed, four are almost complete in respect of the civil works,” he said, adding that access roads remained a challenge to existing sites.
Engineers would be going to China next week to inspect towers before they are shipped.
He said they hoped to complete the whole process in March next year.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Mutoko', 'Mashonaland East Province'], 'IND': ['Kotwa']}",tech_transfer_investment,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],"['Huawei', 'Chinese']"

NetOne’s network expansion will enable it to accommodate an additional four million users and to provide internet services at high speeds
Martin Kadzere Senior Business Reporter
THE Exim Bank of China has released $65 million for NetOne’s network expansion. The money, which is 30 percent deposit of the total credit facility, was released to Huawei International of China, a company contracted to undertake the network expansion, NetOne managing director Mr Reward Kangai said in an interview last week.
“It is a down payment that will enable our contractor to start manufacturing the telecommunications equipment including towers and base stations,” said Mr Reward Kangai.
“We are not receiving money but it is paid directly to the contractors as and when it is needed.”
This will see NetOne, with 3,3 million subscribers, expanding its network capacity to accommodate more users and improve voice quality and data speeds going up to 4G technology.
Government signed a concessional loan agreement with China Exim Bank worth $218,9 million for NetOne’s network expansion under the company’s Phase II Project.
The loan agreement carries an interest rate of 2 percent per annum and is payable over a period of 20 years. NetOne has opened an escrow account where it will deposit repayments.
“The expansion will see us accommodating an additional four million users and to provide internet services at high speeds,” said Mr Kangai.
Last year, the company spent about $20 million on capital expenditure which included setting up 50 base stations.
NetOne contracted Nokia and Huawei to undertake the project.
“Upon the completion of these two projects, NetOne will have capacity to accommodate 12 million users,” he said.
Econet Wireless, the largest mobile phone company has nine million subscribers.
The expansion of NetOne is among several infrastructure projects being funded by the Chinese.
Telecommunications fall under the infrastructure and utilities cluster, one of the four clusters of Zim-Asset, the country’s economic blueprint.
The Government has already contracted Sino-Hydro to expand capacity at Hwange Power Station at a cost of $1,5 billion.
The project will add 600 megawatts onto the grid. The same company was also contracted to add two units at Kariba Hydro Power Station.
Some of the projects being financed and implemented by Chinese companies include the $150 million expansion of Victoria Falls airport and the rehabilitation of Harare Morton Jeffrey water plant at a cost of $144 million.
In addition, the Government is in negotiations with China Africa Sunlight Energy Company to secure a facility of $53 million to augment funding for construction of the Gwayi-Shangani Dam in Matabeleland.
An MoU was signed between the Zimbabwe National Water Authority and CASECO, paving way for disbursement of the funds.",1,,,{'ZWE': ['Victoria Falls Airport']},tech_transfer_investment,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],"['Huawei', 'China']"

Under the secret project, political parties are identified with codes.
Zanu-PF’s code is 3, MDC-T 8, Mavambo/Kusile/Dawn 7, Zapu 10, Zapu Federal 19, MDC-N 2, MDC Mutambara 5, MDC 99 23, Mthwakazi 14, Puma 13 and non-political parties, MKS 211.
It is believed the data collected would be forwarded to NGOs and Western governments who would in turn use it to discredit the next elections if won by President Mugabe.
The recruits use a personalised and encrypted password, Tendai, and the test run was actually going on in urban and rural areas.
The systems make it easy to communicate, undetected by security forces, quick information like a secret meeting or gathering, through the password, Tendai.

For example, “Tendai meeting at Africa Unity Square, 12 noon, 3.”
That could mean go and monitor a Zanu-PF meeting at Africa Unity Square.
Police yesterday said they were now investigating the organisation.
According to police, a recent search at ZPP’s offices at Number 17425 Flanagan Drive in Hillside, Harare, resulted in the recovery of subversive material, documents and communication gadgets.
These are suspected to have been imported illegally, with the help of hostile Western donor organisations and NGOs.
Some of the gadgets include Eton Microlink radios, event forms, Huawei Ascend Y100 cellphones and floppy diskettes containing hate speech.
Police believe that some registered NGOs were also behind the distribution of the gadgets in rural areas.
ZPP is led by Ms Mukoko, who was once arrested a few years ago for being involved in activities deemed to be detrimental to the State.
She was freed by the Supreme Court on the basis of some constitutional breaches.
Chief police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba told journalists that ZPP was unregistered and its activities were a threat to State security.
“ZRP has it on good authority that certain entities like the Zimbabwe Peace Project purport to be engaged in humanitarian work as an NGO whereas they are an illegal conduit to the regime change agenda by carrying out covert political activities tantamount to causing a threat to State security and violating the country’s laws,” she said.
Asst Comm Charamba said investigations carried out after the searches at the ZPP offices revealed that the organisation was employing dirty tactics by deploying “field monitors’’ to various rural areas.
Once in such areas, the monitors ask desperate youths to fill in the event forms to allege harassment, intimidation, assault, threats by the Central Intelligence Organisation, police, war veterans, army and militia.
Asst Comm Charamba said ZPP had come up with codes for political parties, incidents, violations and denials which they fill in on the event forms.
She said the codes would be filled in on the forms instead of writing the names of the political parties.
The forms would also contain a summary of what was happening at any political gathering of any party.
ZPP mostly targeted Zanu-PF, with most of the information filled on the forms having been found to be false, police said.
“Surprisingly, no such political incidents as described in the event forms would have taken place,” said Asst Comm Charamba.
“The information being coded is highly sensitive and prejudicial to State security and is intended for their handlers who are outside the country.
“Further to that, Zimbabwe Peace Project is operating illegally as a non-governmental organisation and is not even registered under the Private and Voluntary Organisations Act.”
Asst Comm Charamba urged people in both rural and urban areas to be wary of strangers who masquerade as NGOs and entice them with money to divulge negative and false information about the country.
She said such cases should be reported to the police.
“We have a constitutional obligation as a police force to maintain law and order and our raids are not an onslaught on civil society, but we act on information to unearth criminal activities,” she said.
Asst Comm Charamba said certain NGOs were accusing the police of being partisan and selectively applying the law when they were the ones abandoning their humanitarian mandate to engage in political activities to the detriment of State security and the country’s stability.
“The ZRP promises to remain fair and firm in the discharge of our duties and protecting the interests of law and order at all cost,” she said.
Police recently confiscated the communication devices which they said were being distributed by non-governmental organisations countrywide with the aid of some political parties.
Although police could not give figures, sources said hundreds of such devices, including specially designed radios, have been confiscated, especially in the rural areas.
It is illegal for anyone to possess or operate signal transmission equipment other than in accordance with a licence issued by either the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe or Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe.
Police investigations have also revealed that there were groups of between 40 and 50 people who were gathering at night in various parts of the country for political activities.
President Mugabe recently said voting in the referendum on the draft Constitution would be conducted over one day on March 16, with polling stations opening at 7am and closing at 7pm.
The proclamation by President Mugabe was contained in the Government Gazette which validated the referendum date through Statutory Instrument 19 of 2013.
The referendum would pave way for the much awaited harmonised elections which would end the inclusive Government established in 2009.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare']}",intelligence_counterintelligence,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei']

Zimbabwe,10744,theindependent.co.zw,2019-08-09T12:02:20Z,… Beijing rebuffs snooping reports,"THE Chinese embassy has dismissed reports that the primary reason it is financing construction of the new US$100 million parliament in Mt Hampden is to snoop on Zimbabwe, but rather to deepen “democracy and good governance”.
TINASHE KAIRIZA
This comes in the wake of allegations levelled against Beijing after it constructed the African Union (AU) headquarters in Ethiopia at a cost of US$200 million in 2012.
A French publication in 2014 reported that to buttress its growing commercial and political interests in Africa, the Chinese had bugged the newly AU building.
However, then AU Commissioner Mousa Faki dismissed the allegations, saying they were meant to weaken the solid relations between Africa and Beijing.
Last week, the Zimbabwe Independent reported on the construction of the parliament set to be completed in 2021, sparking debate on social media. Some opinion writers alleged Harare was mortgaging minerals to Beijing which was also setting a debt trap for the country.
Deputy Chinese ambassador Zhao Baogang said: “We have also provided a US$100 million grant to construct Zimbabwe’s new parliament building. This is the biggest China-aided project in Southern Africa and this project was at the request of the Government of Zimbabwe.
“It is meant to support good governance and democracy. We hope that our aid can be appreciated because it is in the spirit of cooperation between China and Zimbabwe. It is a free grant, but there are people who are saying Zimbabwe is mortgaging its minerals to Zimbabwe. This is entirely not true.”
Baogang said reports that China would bug the parliament were baseless.
“If we put bugs, it can easily be detected and this would destroy relations,” Baogang said.
He said although Beijing had advanced Harare loans for infrastructure, energy and agricultural development, the loans were not designed to trap the country but to assist at a time of need and ensure development.
“Even in China we borrow from banks including European banks to fund infrastructure development and then pay off our loans. There is nothing wrong with loans,” he said.
“But you cannot say Zimbabwe is in a debt trap because of China. Zimbabwe has a foreign debt of about US$8 billion. Most of it is from multilateral institutions and the Paris Club not China.”
Baogang said reports that Harare was mortgaging its minerals in return for Chinese loans were false.

Zimbabwe,1381,zimbabwesituation.com,2013-10-25T22:34:57Z,Chinese man caught smuggling ivory from Zimbabwe,"More than 200 pounds of raw ivory found in luggage of Chinese man at airport in Zimbabwe capital, weeks after elephants were poisoned with cyanide by poachers
A Chinese citizen was remanded in custody after being arrested at Harare International Airport when customs officials found 17 pieces of raw ivory in his luggage.
Chen Guoliang, 36, temporarily resident in Zimbabwe was accused in the Harare Magistrate’s Court on Thursday of contravening the Parks and Wildlife Act, after being found in illegal possession of 218lbs of fresh ivory packed in boxes and security wrapped in plastic and checked in as his luggage for his flight to China.
Harare magistrate Don Ndirowei heard that customs officers noticed unusual items when they scanned his luggage and he was arrested after admitting he had no permit to export the tusks.
His case was remanded until November 4.
Caroline Washaya-Moyo, public relations officer for Zimbabwe’s National Parks and Wildlife Authority said tests had not been concluded yet to see if the tusks came from any of hundreds of elephants poisoned with cyanide in the Hwange National Park.
“We will let you know when we find out, but we have several more people waiting to be processed through the courts on illegal ivory charges.” A rash of ivory crimes has been uncovered since the first carcasses of poisoned elephants were found in the southern part of the 5,500 sq mile park in western Zimbabwe.
Last week two Zimbabwe drivers, Langton Saka, 35 and James Byirenda 37, were arrested shortly after they crossed the South African border. Four tusks were found hidden inside the bus. They were found guilty and sentenced to four years in prison.
“The sentences are so light in South Africa,” Ms Washaya-Moyo said.
A further 12 people were arrested so far in connection with the dead elephants and four were swiftly processed through the courts and sentenced to 16 years in prison and heavily fined after being found guilty of poaching by poisoning elephants.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare', 'Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa']}",transnational_organization_crime,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,2262,zimbabwesituation.com,2014-04-22T20:48:22Z,Chinese merchant gateways for ivory and rhino horns,"In the remote Zambezi region of Southern Africa, where Namibia shares international borders with Angola, Zambia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, geography and opportunity create ideal circumstances for ivory poachers.
With more than 9,100 residential elephants and 30,000 migrating elephants, according to 2013 data, elephant poaching was not a serious issue in the transborder area until recently. In 2010 and 2011, the numbers of elephant poached in isolated cases were four and six respectively. However, in 2012 the situation changed, with at least 78 elephants poached by international smugglers in one year. By November 2013, official records showed that at least 20 elephants had been poached since the start of the year, and 35 smuggling suspects had been arrested.
Namibia was the first African country to incorporate protection of the environment into its constitution and today more than 40 per cent of the country’s surface area is under conservation management. Community-based conservancies are well integrated into the tourism industry. In the Zambezi region, formerly known as Caprivi, officials noticed a growth in wildlife trafficking from around 2010. ‘That Chinese [man] you mentioned appears to be the most important middle player in it, although some other nationals have their channels as well,’ said Shadrick Siloka, chief warden in the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET) office of Katima, the capital of Zambezi region.
During my first visit to the MET office two days previously, officials had been reluctant to release any information, However, but once I shared some results from my own undercover investigation in the Chinese community of Katima, they were prepared to admit they were investigating the same person.
According to Siloka, the change in the status quo was associated with hearing the name of Guo Yunhui, a Chinese businessman in Katima. In 2010, the MET heard from informers that Guo was collecting pythons and pangolins. In 2011, Guo was arrested for buying two ivory tusks from MET staff, fined 20,000 Namibian dollars and released. But informers and the MET allege that he is again at the centre of the Namibian ivory trade, and is using the same transportation and trading routes as his formal business. My undercover investigation supported this theory.
In his everyday persona, Guo Yunhui is the owner of Sweet Guest House, the only Chinese hostel in Katima. Most of its clientele are Africans, many from Zambia. Like many other Chinese, he has his main business and then informal business, and consequently rarely shows up at his guesthouse, which is managed on a daily basis by two local women.
As a Chinese journalist I was able to meet and socialise with many Chinese shop owners in Katima, and to ask about Guo Yunhui and the trade in animal products. Zheng, a Chinese worker in a Chinese construction company near Katima, is a friend of Guo’s family and he visits them frequently. According to Zheng, Guo is still engaged in his wildlife smuggling business.
Chen, a Chinese businessman in Rundu, also confirmed that Guo is active in the business, although he didn’t characterise it as smuggling, but rather as helping Chinese in far-flung cities to acquire ivory souvenirs. Ou, a Chinese shop owner, claimed he lent Guo money when Guo was buying ivory in the past, and that Guo was conducting a lot of informal ‘side business’ of a dubious nature. However, Ou had not seen Guo for a long time.
Guo may not be the largest player in the Zambezi ivory market, according to Li, a leader in the Chinese-Fujian business communities of Namibia. Li referred to another Chinese man in Katima whom he said was found by police in early 2013 with more than 100kg of ivory, but MET said it did not know about the case. The low risk of getting caught, added to monetary incentives and the Chinese community’s lack of support for the Namibian conservation effort, are all factors encouraging and enabling wildlife smuggling.
Katima is a central hub of trading between trans-border African smugglers and Chinese shop keepers and traders. Chinese shops dominate the main road in town, and unlike employees from Chinese state-owned companies who are driven by state policy, these Chinese shop owners are usually self-driven immigrants simply looking for business space and an opportunity to make money.
Most of the time they are from second or third-tier cities or small towns in China where services are poor, and consequently they are characterized by low educational achievements and poor foreign language skills. Outside China, even the Chinese government does not have clear statistics about them, not to mention effective management.
My investigation indicated the majority of them are from Fujian province, including the ivory smuggler Guo Yunhui. Many of the shop owners are linked to the ivory trade in the guise of buying and selling of ivory souvenirs and artefacts for export and sale to tourists. Because of the widely perceived permissibility of the small ‘souvenir’ trade in ivory products, the Chinese community members are reluctant to blow the whistle on the larger ivory smugglers, and alleged involvement by Chinese diplomats themselves, even though they are aware that these individuals are ruining the reputation of Chinese businesspeople more generally in Africa.
Many Chinese shun the easy money to be made by ivory and rhino horn smuggling because they know it is wrong and illegal. But relations with host country law enforcement and conservation officers remain too weak for them to break their false loyalty to other Chinese nationals, even when they are indulging in criminal behaviour.
In Katima, it is common for Chinese people to be approached by African ivory sellers, mostly Zambians. Ou said in the 10 years he has lived in Zambezi he has been approached many times by sellers who tell him how high the profit is if he would transport ivory from Namibia to China.
This is confirmed by the MET, who recorded that the price Guo paid to the sellers of ivory was 300 Namibian dollars per kilo, whereas in Asia the selling price is at least 3 000 US dollars per kilo. In Oshikango, another border town west of Katima, I spoke to Yang, a shop owner in Chinatown. ‘Zambians used to come to our Chinatown with boxes full of ivory, and lots of Chinese shop owners have bought them,’ he said. He claimed to have taken small amounts of ivory back to China many times, and they were never found by customs.
Yang also said he had bought some rhino horn powder, but did not want to give further details ‘I know there are people smuggling full rhino horns back to China, but you are being too curious. Don’t ask too much about such things,’ he said.
‘In 2012 the amount of ivory we captured was 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the amount of ivory taken from poached elephants in Namibia,’ said Morgan Saisai, the chief control officer of MET in Katima. According to MET officials, the ivory on the Zambezi market is not only from local sources, but is being transported from surrounding countries. The criminal groups they have apprehended included Zambians, Congolese and Zimbabweans working with Namibians.
‘Zambia is where ivory and smugglers are most likely to come into Namibia,’ said Oswald Rall, a former policeman still living in the region. Katima is where it is easiest for the Chinese people to buy ivory from Zambians. Infrastructure is rapidly improving, at least because of Chinese road construction projects. Truck routes from Walvis Bay on the coast to Rundu and Katima, then on to Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, are relatively efficient and fast.
Using trucks and networks for transporting other goods businesses, ivory is transported to areas with the highest densities of Chinese. It is placed in the retail markets, and becomes small souvenirs for Chinese people to carry home to China in their luggage.
What is most worrying for the conservation of elephants is that the ivory trade is just one of a number of illegal behaviours which are viewed as normal and far from wrong among the Chinese residents. Eager to make personal gains, many do not care whether it is legal or not as long as punishment is avoidable. In such a context, buying small amounts of ‘souvenir’ ivory is not considered smuggling, so that a large ivory market is formed by many individuals buying small retail amounts which collectively represent a large amount wholesale. According to the Chinese who take home souvenirs, the chance of ivory being discovered by airport customs in Namibia or China is very low and even when it is found, the consequences are not severe.
During this investigation, many Chinese expressed the view that they wished the Chinese immigrant communities could be better managed in order to reduce the reputational damage being done to all Chinese people in Africa by the activities of just a few. This view is made more apposite as long as the small traders remain beyond the reach of the law, and are thus tempted to join the illegal trade.
While ivory trade in Namibia is not yet as large as in other African countries like Mozambique, it is growing. There is evidence that the scale of trade is more than a few Chinese families buying from Africans across the border and reselling small souvenirs to other Chinese people. In fact, this characterisation indicates a dangerous complacency, particularly as the evidence shows that much bigger volumes are trading through these networks – and they include wildlife products from other endangered species besides elephants.
China is responsible for an estimated 70 percent of the world trade in elephant tusk ivory, and research by the international wildlife trade monitoring organisation traffic indicates that nearly 80 percent of reported illegal rhino horn seizures in Asia between 2009 and late last year happened in China. For the first time, journalists from mainland China worked with African journalists on an undercover investigation into the Chinese role in the ivory and rhino horns market in South Africa and Mozambique.
Wildlife trafficking syndicates brazenly sell rhino horn and ivory at Chinese markets in Southern Africa’s capital cities, in the face of global attempts to crack down on the illicit trade in endangered species. Who are the people involved, and how do they go about buying these illegal products? Until it was closed, the Bruma Lake flea market in eastern Johannesburg and nearby New Chinatown have been a hub of the illicit trade in rhino horns and ivory in South Africa. Transactions between African sellers and Asian buyers occurred relatively openly on a daily basis.
From 9am to 5pm, sellers hung around the entrance to the Bruma flea market and eagerly surround Chinese people as they approach. ‘What are you looking for? Do you want xiangya? I have,’ said Mike, a seller who hails from the Democratic Republic of Congo. ‘Do you have xiniujiao?’ we asked. Xiangya is the Chinese term for ivory, xiniujiao for rhino horns, and it is clear Mike, as well as many other shop owners, is familiar with the terms. ‘Xiniujiao… anytime but now. If you come back next month, maybe I could help you get some. Now it is impossible,’ said Mike.
He opened a door which is covered by a hanged blanket, showed us into a secret room near his craft shop where he has a stock of worked ivory products: small sculptures of elephants, chopsticks, necklaces, bracelets. The price is not too expensive, starting at $20 a piece. Matt, a Zimbabwean who works in Mike’s craft shop, said most of the rhino horns and ivory they are selling comes from his home country. He explained how he imports it: ‘There is a river that divides the two countries and we find a part where the water is not too deep and there is almost no security patrolling. We take off our clothes and carry the stuff on our shoulders across the river.’ His biggest concern was crocodiles in some parts of the Limpopo River.
Other shop owners in the market called out to us with offers of xiangya and xiniujiao. ‘Your Chinese friends may find it hard to get rhino horns, but we are Africans, we know how.’ said Ernest, another shop owner from the Congo,
Along Derrick Avenue in New Chinatown, home to most of Johannesburg’s recent Chinese immigrants, we spoke to Gong, a taxi driver whose business card includes various services related to immigration, the embassy and police. ‘It is easy to buy ivory and I could help you tell which ones are fake — I have been buying it for many years,’ he says.
Ivory is just one of the businesses Gong has engaged in since he immigrated to South Africa six years ago. Like most Chinese in the New Chinatown community, he did not have a good educational background and barely speaks English. He used to assist a friend running a brothel until police closed it down.
However, he does not think it is a good idea for a visitor to purchase rhino horns here because it has become too risky. ‘Nowadays it is more dangerous than drugs,’ he said. ‘Even if I could get it for you, I would not take the risk of selling it to an outsider like you rather than known partners. Ivory and rhino horns are like weed [dagga] and heroine.’
Gong says fewer Chinese are directly involved in smuggling rhino horn these days, although some still buy from Vietnamese traffickers. Consumers would be better advised to buy horn in China, where he could introduce us to sellers, he adds. China accounted for an estimated two-thirds of the number and weight of horns seized in Asia between 2009 and September 2012, according to figures collated by Traffic.
Many employees of Chinese companies in South Africa avoid New Chinatown, so named to distinguish it from the original Chinatown in central Johannesburg, because of its reputation for being involved with smuggling and other dangerous business. ‘I would usually not go to the New Chinatown area. There is a mix of good people and various criminals,’ says Zhang Jinguo, the head of the Chinese Construction Bank in Johannesburg.
Among the Chinese residents of Johannesburg, it is common knowledge that the Chinese buy ivory and rhino horn much more often in Maputo, capital city of neighbouring Mozambique. The Saturday market at Praça 25 de Junho in Maputo is the main buying site for employees of Chinese companies who are not well educated and have unskilled jobs. ‘The products are unique and cheap,’ says Chen, a frequent Chinese buyer in Maputo who works for a Chinese construction company.
At the Saturday market, Kai, a 29-year-old working for a Chinese telecommunications company, is shooting a video to send to his families in China. ‘Hello dears, look where I am. This is the most famous ivory market here, I will bring you some good stuff,’ he says.
Shop owners like Adam are visibly excited when they see a group of Chinese people approaching. ‘Come, we have heimu and xiangya,’ he says. He says the Chinese are generally interested in buying two things in Mozambique: heimu, which is a black wood, and xiangya, namely ivory.
He also offers rhino horns at $15,000 a kilogram, though he says he does not keep it in the marketplace because it is too expensive. He opens a big box filled with various ivory products and displays them openly. However, when some Chinese customers lift the ivory too high he asks them to put them down, in case the police notice and make trouble.
Dong, an employee of a Chinese national oil company who has been in Mozambique for almost four years, is browsing through the market with three colleagues. He is mostly interested in buying bracelets made of black wood, animal horns and ivory. After bargaining, he buys two ivory bracelets for about $50 and his colleague buys two as well. ‘We will need to take them apart and hide the pieces in the corners of our luggage. Then even if customs finds some we can still make them up into bracelets again in China,’ Dong advises his less-experienced colleague.
As Dong’s group walks away, a nearby shop owner reminds them to hide their ivory bracelets inside their pockets, because if the police see them they will ask for money to ‘solve the problem’. Policemen are patrolling the market all the time, but they seem more interested in asking foreigners for their passports and money than finding ivory.
Unlike the Saturday ‘ivory market’, the craft market on nearby Mao Tse Tung avenue opens every day. Chen, who has worked for a Maputo-based Chinese construction company for the past two years, is going back home in December and needs to stock up on souvenirs for friends and families. He buys two pairs of ivory chopsticks, and says even though they may be confiscated by customs he can afford the loss. ‘Sometimes they pass and these things are cheap enough to be taken away if we have bad luck,’ he says.
A colleague recently bought a large ivory sculpture and when it was found by customs officers in Mozambique he paid $300 to get it through. No one at customs in Beijing found it, Chen says. He has a good collection of ivory products, and believes they can be an investment. ‘When you have enough money, you display them in your house. When you need money, you can always sell them,’ he says.
Most of the Chinese buyers know where the ivory comes from, but don’t care about the slaughter of elephants. Kai, one of the buyers of ivory bracelets, sums up their feeling when he admits that he did not feel guilty about buying ivory products even though he knows how the sellers get it. However, there are some Chinese who refuse to buy into the market. ‘These items are art from killing,’ says Xu, a friend and colleague of Kai. But he indicates that there are few Chinese like him.
The Chinese embassy in Pretoria challenged this investigation in a letter published by the Mail & Guardian. Pan Peng, the embassy’s press counsellor, wrote: ‘The Chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of wildlife and has promulgated laws and regulations in this concern, established a multi-sectoral joint law-enforcement mechanism, and taken various measures to protect wildlife and raise public awareness.’ As a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) since 1981, China has long been committed to co-operation with South Africa on wildlife protection, Peng said.

Zimbabwe,4511,newzimbabwevision.com,2015-08-20T20:00:05Z,‘Chinese Poaching Cartels & Villagers Exhume Lion Bones For Lucrative Illegal Asian Wine Market Trade ‘,"VILLAGERS around the Hwange wildlife conservancy area are reported to be illegally working with Chinese poaching cartels to exhume lion skeletons whose bones are processed into top quality wine fetching up to $20,000 a bottle.
The chairperson of the Zimbabwe Conservation Taskforce, Johnny Rodrigues, confirmed the development, Wednesday.
He said the lion bones had a lucrative market in Asia, adding this has motivated villagers around the Hwange to exhume skeletons that were buried after trophy hunting.
“The illegal trade started around 2012 but it has since picked up. It is being coordinated by a Chinese woman known as Lin Sun,” Rodrigues said.
He said there was an easy link between the poachers and middlemen to sell the bones, a link which he said the police and other government departments were aware of.
Because of high returns in the illegal trade, Rodrigues explained, the poachers were now targeting female lions and cubs, which are not part of the lucrative male trophy hunting.
The harvested skeletons are reported to be sold to Chinese traders in Johannesburg or Durban in South Africa where they fetch between $1,260 and $1,560 without a skull or $1,890 to $2,100 with a skull, depending on the size.
Rodrigues’ claims are supported by a joint report compiled by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and the international wildlife monitoring network, Traffic.
The report, which was carried out soon after the killing of Cecil the Lion in July, noted that things could get worse for the lions if nothing was done to stop the illegal trade.
Reports say there is significant evidence that lions are being poached for their bones and skins in Zimbabwe and Tanzania as the growth of the lion bone trade in Asia has generated a previously unexploited value for female lions and their cubs.
The report said the interest in lion bones was as a result of an acute decline in tiger bones for the same purpose of producing tiger wine. The lion bones are now filling the gap and boosting the Asian trade.
The lion bones are reported to have a ready market in Vietnam, China and Make where they are boiled and bottled and processed into wine.

by VENERANDA LANGA
Introducing a motion on human trafficking in the National Assembly yesterday, the chairperson of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Women Affairs, Biata Nyamupinga, said most of the women trafficked to China were married to Nigerians.
She claimed the women were arrested after they were caught with wedding gowns loaded with hard drugs.
“Our women are not only trafficked in Kuwait, but in countries like China, other Arab countries, and even South Africa,” Nyamupinga said.
“As we speak right now, we have contacts of the so-called employers, who have our girls in a basement suffering torture, inhuman treatment and sexual exploitation.”
Nyamupinga said the women were not allowed to bathe using soap and only allowed to sleep for two hours. She said some churches and sects in Zimbabwe were fuelling human trafficking.
“Girls are abused in Apostolic sects under the guise that they are being trained as sisters. Rural girls are also brought into cities to work as housemaids and abused or forced to work at brothels. Churches pray for people to get employment and immediately human trafficking syndicates promise them jobs,” she said.
Male MPs yesterday joined their female counterparts in sitting on the floor to protest the enslavement of Zimbabwean women in Kuwait.
But National Assembly Speaker Jacob Mudenda ruled that this was disturbing Parliamentary business.
Meanwhile, former ICT minister Webster Shamu denied owning a strip club at the centre of debate in the National Assembly.
“May I inform the House that I do not own any kind of night club in my business activities. In fact, it is now a feature in this House that people cast aspersions on other MPs,” he said.
“The same opposition MPs accused me of getting a vehicle from ZBC [Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation]. We must speak the truth in this House. Without full investigations, we have no right to speak.”

Zimbabwe,6177,newzimbabwevision.com,2016-05-20T01:20:17Z,"‘200 Zimbabweans, Mostly Women On Death Row In China For Drug Trafficking’","ABOUT 200 Zimbabweans, mostly women, are on death row in China after they were arrested for drug trafficking, an MP has said. Women Affairs, Gender and Community Development parliamentary portfolio committee chairperson Cde Beatrice Nyamupinga moved a motion on human trafficking in the National Assembly on Tuesday, where she made the revelations.
The Zanu-PF MP for Goromonzi said most of the women on death row were duped by their Nigerian boyfriends that they were going for shopping in preparation for their weddings and drugs would be placed in their luggage without their knowledge.
She said the Nigerians would have paid lobola for the women who the West Africans then use as drug mules.
“We’ve about 200 Zimbabweans and the majority of the 200 are women, who are on the death row in China because they’ve been used by the so-called Nigerians who are coming here, marrying them through an Act that we enacted in this House. They marry them and then ask them to go to China to buy their wedding gowns,” said Cde Nyamupinga.
“As they go to China to buy their wedding gowns, they’re given a bag, which has a false bottom and in that false bottom, drugs are secretly packed. They’re told ‘when you get to China my friend is going to receive you and will show you the shops where you can buy your gown.’ She gets to China and the immigration and customs of China know that and these girls are intercepted and convicted.”
Cde Nyamupinga also said thousands of other women are stranded in other countries after being promised lucrative jobs.
“It’s with a heavy heart that I rise to move a motion on human trafficking following the repatriation of around 53 out of 1,000 women believed to have been trafficked to Kuwait. Not only Kuwait but to other countries like China, other Arab countries and including South Africa of all countries,” said Cde Nyamupinga.
“On this one, let me also add that these girls or the women who are being trafficked, we’ve almost 2,000 or over 1,000 that are roaming around China as we speak right now. They were trafficked to China and some of them are now desperate and stranded in China.”
She said government departments should swiftly address the issue of foreigners marrying locals as they are the ones contributing to the challenges of human trafficking.
“Once that’s done, the Nigerian will go and marry the next one. I don’t know the game of changing names and whatever happens. I think also the Minister of Home Affairs, through the Registrar General, should also look at this.
“So, these women now — you know in China, they’ll tell you that once you bring drugs, it’s death penalty, almost 200 are on death row and of the 200, the majority are women,” she said.
Cde Nyamupinga said an inter-ministerial committee should be tasked to address the human trafficking issue.
She said human trafficking is even happening locally where girls are moved from rural areas to cities after being promised employment only to be deployed in brothels as prostitutes.
According to Amnesty International, China tops globally when it comes to executions but figures of victims of capital punishment have been kept a State secret.
On the other hand, even though Zimbabwe upholds the death sentence for men aged between 21 and 70 years, it has not carried out any executions since 2004.
Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa who is also the Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs has vowed not to authorise any executions.
VP Mnangagwa escaped death by hanging in the 1960s following his conviction for sabotage by the Rhodesian regime because of his youthful age.

Zimbabwe,8313,chronicle.co.zw,2017-09-21T02:04:20Z,Legislators gang up to grill Chinamasa over illegal cash dealers,"Minister Patrick Chinamasa
Zvamaida Murwira, Harare Bureau
Finance and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa was yesterday taken to task by legislators over Government’s inaction on the illegal sale of scarce cash on the black market.
Members of Parliament across the political divide asked the minister why there was no evident effort to arrest and take to court cash dealers whom they claimed acted in cahoots with financial institutions and influential individuals.
The questions were raised in the National Assembly during a question and answer session.
Shamva South Member of Parliament Cde Joseph Mapiki (Zanu-PF) was the first to ask why cash dealers were not being jailed, and fingered members of the Indian and Chinese communities for selling cash at a premium.
Cde Mapiki said EcoCash dealers were also levying charges on those who wanted cash.
Minister Chinamasa said there was no law providing for the arrest and imprisonment of such individuals but that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe was empowered to impose penalties under the Banking Act.
“The law to jail people (dealing in cash) is not yet there. What is there are penalties for those found doing that. We have agreed as Cabinet that a law be put in place. I am not saying cash is not being sold but I do not know about it because I would not be there when people sell it,” said Minister Chinamasa.
His response was met with howls of disapproval from legislators, particularly when he said he wanted to get more information in respect of EcoCash dealers.
Legislators were riled that Minister Chinamasa appeared to suggest he was not aware of a practice that is rampant in the country.
Zvimba West MP Cde Ziyambi Ziyambi (Zanu-PF) said a new law would not solve the problem since financial intitutions were the major culprits.
“There is sale of cash and banks are involved. If you want to travel outside the country they will ask you to deposit your money. Where do they think we would have got it (from)?,” said Cde Ziyambi.
Minister Chinamasa said he was getting regular reports from the central bank on such vices.
He undertook to issue a ministerial statement next week giving full details on the issue.
This was after he was subjected to a barrage of criticism from legislators on why he was not giving precise responses. The legislators were furious that the Minister in some instances said he was not aware of any alleged illegal financial practices.
Glen View North MP Mr Fani Munengami (MDC-T) implored Minister Chinamasa to give detailed responses, including information on a proposed $300 million stand-by liquidity facility and central bank governor Dr John Mangudya’s views on the performance of the bond notes so far, given that he had indicated that he would resign if they failed to achieve intended objectives.
Dr Mangudya introduced the bond notes as part of the multicurrency system in November last year, stating they would be paid out as an incentive to encourage exports and promote formal diaspora remittances.
Responding to another question, Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Joram Gumbo said engineers were already on the ground in preparation for the commencement of dualisation of the Beitbridge-Harare highway.
Harare South MP Cde Shadreck Mashayamombe (Zanu-PF) had asked for an update on the project.",0,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare']}",transnational_organization_crime,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

Zimbabwe,10240,chronicle.co.zw,2019-03-21T00:02:50Z,$1 million illegal ivory Chinese seek to stop trial,"Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter
THE seven Chinese nationals who are accused of illegally possessing more than 20kg of rhino horn pieces with an estimated value of close to $1 million have approached the High Court seeking to stop their trial.
Zeng Dengui (35), Peicon Jang (35), Liu Cheng (23), Yu Xian (25), Yong Zhu (25), Chen Zhiangfu (30) and Qui Jinchang (29) have been in custody since their arrest on December 23.
They have pleaded not guilty to charges of money laundering and possession of ivory.
The seven were supposed to be put to their defence yesterday after Regional Magistrate Mr Collet Ncube dismissed their application for discharge at the close of the State case a fortnight ago.
Their lawyers, Mr Martin Chakasara instructed by Mr Givemore Mvhiringi of Mvhiringi and Associates yesterday sought the court’s leave to defer trial to Monday so they can make an application for review of the magistrates’ court’s decision to dismiss their application for discharge and another one for stay of prosecution pending review.
The defence will submit the applications at the Bulawayo High Court today. Its argument is that the State has no case against the accused.
The magistrate deferred trial to Monday.
“In the interest of a fair trial, I defer the matter to Monday March 25 but should defence fail to file the applications between today and Monday the matter will proceed. However, if the applications are made, the High Court will determine,” said Mr Ncube.
The prosecution represented by Mrs Martha Cheda and Ms Memory Munsaka led evidence from police and Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority investigators.
Allegations against the seven are that on December 23, they were found in possession of several pieces of rhino horns weighing 20,98kg and valued at $938 700 at house number 858 Aerodrome suburb in Victoria Falls where they were renting.
The house belongs to a taxidermist who operates a wildlife trophy shop.
Police allegedly received a tip-off and raided the house after obtaining a search warrant from court.
They recovered several pieces of rhino horns weighing 20,98kg in a bedroom used by one of the accused.
A digital scale was also recovered.

Zimbabwe,13470,chronicle.co.zw,2022-04-28T11:50:38Z,Machete armed robber jailed 50 years,"Thupeyo Muleya Beitbridge Bureau
A 27-year-old man who led a gang of seven on an orgy of armed robberies around Beitbridge district has been jailed for 50 years by a local regional court.
Conscious Gumbo of Mawale village under Chief Matibe was convicted on five counts of armed robbery when he appeared before Mr Innocent Bepura.
The accused and his accomplices used firearms, machetes, and knobkerries to subdue their victims mainly motorists.
His accomplices, Handson Tawanda Mhlanga (26), Philemon Chezani (24), and Brian Mudau (26) were each slapped with 12 years’ imprisonment, while one Thembani Ncube (20) was jailed for 20 years.
Two others, Life Shumba (30) and Nyashadzashe Shoko (20) were acquitted after a full trial.
A warrant of arrest was also issued against a 17-year-old juvenile who disappeared after securing bail.
All the accused persons are from the Beitbridge district.
Prosecuting Mr Cloudios Karinga said the gang along with two others still at large and acting in common purpose went on an armed robbery spree between 2020 and last year targeting motorists.
He said the gang pounced on the victims around Beitbridge town and the major highway leading to Masvingo.
The court heard that in one of the incidents, the accused persons attacked a motorist, Simon Zvarivadza on December 24, 2020, at the Joko area 60km along the Beitbridge to Masvingo road.
Armed with machetes, an unknown firearm and knobkerries, they took cash, USD300, two cellphones, and various groceries from a many they saw relieving himself by the roadside.
Mr Karinga said the men drove to Mawale where they shared the loot and later burnt the vehicle after discovering that it had a tractor.
He said on February 1 last year, using the same method, Gumbo and crew attacked Musa Juwandu and stole US$600, a Huawei Y6 and Huawei Y7 cellphone both worth R5000, and went away.
The state said on 14 February 2021 the gang robbed one Carlos Zvidza of a Toyota corolla, R750, and a cellphone in Beitbridge town. They had found the man in his vehicle with his girlfriend.
The prosecutor added that the accused continued with the reign of terror and attacked four more people using the same method and stole money, cellphones, and vehicles they would later dump.
They ran out of luck when Gumbo was arrested on July 3 for following thorough police investigations, and he later led the police to the rest of the gang members.

DEFENCE Minister Sydney Sekeramayi has slammed the United States of America for cooking up a story alleging China is building a military base in the country.The issue came up for discussion last week during a hearing on Zimbabwe by the sub-committee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organisations.A United States panel on Africa was told of China building a military base in eastern Zimbabwe, raising alarm in Washington which is increasingly worried about Beijing’s growing influence in Africa.California Congresswoman Karen Ruth Bass asked Shannon Smith – who had just returned from a visit to Harare – during a hearing on Zimbabwe the following question:“In recent years Zimbabwe has strengthened trade and military ties with China, including the construction of a Chinese military base in Eastern Zimbabwe. What if any, if you could speak to that, I think there’s obviously security implications for the United States. What do we know about that?”Smith did not provide a direct answer, only commenting that ties between China and Zimbabwe had deepened over the years.“The countries clearly enjoy a close relationship; China is active in much of Africa as you’ve seen in many places I know,” Smith responded, adding that Chinese investments were mainly in mining.Congresswoman Bass pressed further, asking who was being employed at the said camp – Chinese nationals or Zimbabweans – to which Smith said, “I couldn’t tell you.”Chairperson of the subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organisations Chris Smith told congress that China’s growing influence in the world was bad for democracy.Minister Sekeramayi yesterday rubbished the US Congress Debate.He said the subject of the debate was a shameless concoction by the US delegation.“That’s utter nonsense. There’s no shred of truth in that story,” said Sekeramayi.He said he could not understand why anyone would make up such a story.“Our partners from the East are not building anything in that part of the country (Eastern Highlands).

Zimbabwe,13093,theindependent.co.zw,2021-10-15T11:42:21Z,Motoring: Tanks to invade Zim,"By Andrew Muzamhindo
IT reads like a sensational headline especially for any apprehensive Zimbo out there but it is true Tanks are coming. They will one day invade Zimbabwe, courtesy of Zimoco.
GMW is taking aim at Japan’s most legendary name-plate, with the new Great Wall Tank 600 revealed with the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado in its sights.
Actually they have a whole range of Tanks aimed at the Land Cruiser range.
GWM is studying the potential for its hardcore SUV sub-brand Tank for the African market, and it will be headlined by the full-sized rock-hopping 700 model.
A timeframe for the Tank 700 is currently unclear, but with the Tank 300 expected to be given the go ahead for an early 2022 introduction soon, the flagship SUV could arrive towards the end of next year or early in 2023.
The Tank 700 was unveiled earlier this year at the Shanghai motor show, and with its larger dimensions will set its sights on the Toyota Land Cruiser 300 Series and Nissan Patrol.
The Tank 700 was revealed with a 3.0-litre turbocharged V6 engine, outputting 260Nm/500Nm to all four wheels via a nine-speed automatic transmission.
However, GWM is also working on bringing to market an electrified version of the same engine that will take outputs to 386kW/750Nm.
The hybrid would easily blow away the 227kW/700Nm offered in the 3.3-litre diesel V6 of the LC300, as well as the 298kW/560Nm of the 5.6-litre V8-powered Patrol.
However, Tank will have more up its sleeve to lure potential buyers, with the 700 set to undergo rigorous testing and development of a range of off-road accessories designed to appeal to off-road adventurers.
I understand that these parts will include things like lift kits, all-terrain tyres and wheels, winches, snorkels and more that should give the Tank 700 as much aftermarket appeal as the Land Cruiser and Patrol.
These parts could also come from the relationship GWM has forged with aftermarket modifiers from around the world, with the likes of Shelby building the bakkie-based Baja Snake and Brabus tuning a Wey VV7 GT luxury SUV in the past.
Designed with a technology focus, one such accessory under development is an integrated drone that can fly ahead and scout terrain to feed back into the Tank 700’s cabin, though whether this makes it to production is still unclear.
Aside from the Tank 300 and Tank 700, a Tank 800 also exists for China, though it is a more luxury-focused model that looks to take on the BMW X7, Audi Q7 and Mercedes-Benz GLS, but it is unclear if it is also on the radar for Africa.
Chinese brand’s answer to the Jeep Wrangler is a hot prospect for Zimbabwe too. GWM is working on a plan to sell the Tank 300 — a rugged go-anywhere 4×4 off-roader.
It will be a rival for the Jeep Wrangler, but at a more affordable price point. This could Zimoco advising that Jeep lover who cannot afford the Wrangler to go for Tank 300. The plan was to position the Tank 300 as a hero model, given its serious off-road set-up and striking looks.
The 300 uses a ladder-frame chassis, has locking front and rear diffs, all-terrain tyres, plenty of ground clearance and an impressive level of tech features.
It is peppered with cameras which provide various high-resolution video feeds around the vehicle. It also features a premium interior fit-out.
I suspect the Tank could be in the Zimoco show room by end 2022.
GWM is known for its powerful 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol. This could be mounted on the Tank 300.The petrol engine in question is a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol four-cylinder (167kW/387Nm). There is talk of a diesel 2.4-litre turbocharged unit (135kW/480Nm). Both hook up to an eight-speed ZF automatic transmission.
The bigger, more luxurious Tank 700 is offered with a muscular V6 petrol-electric hybrid powertrain that produces a combined 380kW and 750Nm – enough to outpower the petrol and diesel twin-turbo V6 engines found in the forthcoming new Toyota Land Cruiser 300 Series.
While the exterior design has a strong Jeep flavour and the interior channels Mercedes-Benz, Zimoco is confident the Tank 300 will resonate with Zimbabwean buyers, chiefly because it has been designed for serious off-road work.
The spec sheet starts with a robust ladder-frame chassis, which is a shortened version of the underpinnings found on the GWM SUV, with independent front suspension and a solid rear axle.
There is 224mm of ground clearance, 33-degree approach and 34-degree departure angles, a dual-range gearbox, hill descent control and other switchable off-road modes.
Towing capacity is listed at 3000kg.
It’s not as big as a Wrangler. It is 4760mm long, 1930mm wide and 1903mm tall, with a 2750mm wheelbase, the Tank 300 is about 120mm shorter than a Jeep Wrangler.
The Tank 300 name has already been trademarked in some parts of the world.
However, Zimoco could face supply issues as demand is currently outstripping supply in China.
Believe it or not it is also a favourite with the young powerful women in Chinese corporate world. The demand’s been so high GWM has actually stopped taking orders because they can’t keep up with demand.",0,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'JPN': ['Japan'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",security_force_facility_presence,['Shanghai'],['Shanghai'],['Shanghai'],['Shanghai']

Zimbabwe,3451,newsday.co.zw,2014-12-24T00:00:00Z,Chinamasa defends $379m Defence budgetary allocation,"FINANCE minister Patrick Chinamasa has defended Treasury’s decision to allocate $379 million to the Defence ministry under the 2015 National Budget saying the ministry needed to upgrade its training equipment and beef up its staff.
VENERANDA LANGA
SENIOR PARLIAMENTARY REPORTER
This was after Senators on Friday questioned why the Defence ministry always got the largest piece of the Budget cake when social welfare ministries were severely underfunded.
The issue also caused commotion in the National Assembly last week with opposition MPs questioning the rationale behind giving a lion’s share of the budget to the Defence ministry at a time the country was not under any security threat.
“All activities taking place in agriculture, mining, and tourism need peace and stability and it is the security forces that deter trouble makers,” Chinamasa said.
“What you have to understand about the Defence ministry is that their major costs are not salaries, but equipment because the cost of one helicopter alone is exorbitant,” he said.
Chinamasa said the Defence budget was actually grossly underfunded.
“To have a better equipped army we need a performing economy. The first line of defence in any country is a performing economy. Let us not take the peace and tranquillity that we enjoy in Zimbabwe for granted. It is there because we have a well-trained army. An army which does not recruit fresh blood becomes an old dead army.
“We have not provided for fresh recruitments in the budget which is bad. We also have not provided for training. An army which does not train — when you need it that army will not be good for the country. Even in the absence of war we need an army which keeps recruiting, training and up-grading its equipment,” he said.
Midlands Senator Morgan Komichi (MDC-T) argued that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce should have been allocated as much money as Defence because there was need to resuscitate industry and people were being retrenched.
Harare Metropolitan Senator James Makore (MDC-T) said he did not see any reason why the Defence vote was high because there was no war in Zimbabwe.

An estimated 30 tonnes of personal protective equipment, Covid-19 test kits, gloves, ventilators and other equipment needed to treat Covid-19 patients will be collected from China this week by a chartered flight despatched by Air Zimbabwe tomorrow.
It is understood the consignment was bought by Government to ensure treatment centres and laboratories were equipped.
China went into full production of Covid-19-related equipment and supplies and factories are now supplying many countries, including the United States.
Airzim spokesperson Ms Firstme Vitori confirmed yesterday that the airline was concluding clearance logistics for the charter plane to leave.
“Air Zimbabwe is finalising a cargo charter flight to China scheduled to depart early Friday morning,” she said.
“Once all clearances are granted the charter flight shall position in Beijing to collect cargo towards Covid-19 in Zimbabwe.”
Government has upped its Covid-19 preparedness following the upgrade of Wilkins and Beatrice Infectious diseases hospitals in Harare to cater for coronavirus patients, with work now in progress on more provincial centres and on a large section of Parirenyatwa Hospital.
Five laboratories have been upgraded countrywide for comprehensive testing.
Government has expanded the criteria for those who qualify for Covid-19 testing to include all patients with fever in hospitals, while all people working during the 21-day national lockdown would also be subjected to mandatory testing.

China is committed to supporting Zimbabwe’s military as the friendship between the People’s Liberation Army and Zimbabwe Defence Forces continues to deepen, Defence Attaché of the Chinese Embassy senior Colonel Yonglong Zhu has said.
Speaking at the 96th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) held in Harare, Colonel Yonglong said China’s armed forces were promoting international cooperation and striving for a better world of peace and common security.
“The traditional friendship between the People’s Liberation Army and Zimbabwe Defence Forces was fostered by the founding fathers of the two countries in the 1960s, and has always been cherished and constantly promoted by the two sides over the past decades,” he said.
“The recent years have witnessed this brotherly relationship further strengthened with friendly exchanges and cooperation in all fields flourishing.
“Especially during the pandemic, the two armies did not interrupt any cooperation and exchanges, have actively overcome the interference of the pandemic and continue to advance the development of the relationship between the two armies.
“A friend in need is a friend indeed. China will forever cherish the traditional friendship with Zimbabwe, and the People’s Liberation Army of China will always be a close friend and trustworthy partner of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces.”
Colonel Yonglong said the Chinese army resolutely upholds the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, building a new-model security partnership featuring equality, mutual trust and win-win cooperation.
“China actively supports the United Nations peacekeeping operations. It is a major contributor to the UN peacekeeping budget and the largest troop contributing country among the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
“In line with relevant Security Council resolutions, since December 2008 the Chinese government has dispatched naval ships to carry out vessel protection operations in the Gulf of Aden and the waters off the coast of Somalia.
“China’s armed forces take an active part in the international efforts for disaster rescue and humanitarian assistance.”

Zimbabwe,14550,zimlive.com,2023-12-14T04:46:11Z,Zimbabwe receives US$28 million worth of military hardware from China,"HARARE – China has donated an assortment of military equipment to Zimbabwe, including armoured fighting vehicles and machine guns.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa received the equipment worth US$28 milion from Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding at Inkomo Barracks in Harare on Wednesday.
Officers from the People’s Liberation Army are in Zimbabwe to conduct training on the handling of the equipment.
Mnangagwa said the military hardware “will assist in ensuring that the Zimbabwe Defence Forces remains an efficient and capable force.”
He added: “This delivery of military gratis equipment will go a long way towards consolidating our ongoing quest to modernise the ZDF.
“May I once again recognise China as a consistent friend of Zimbabwe. Over the last 23 years, the socio-economic growth, development and prosperity of our country has been weighed down by the albatross of the Western imposed illegal sanctions. Throughout this period, China has been a true and reliable ally. We are forever thankful.”
The equipment includes armoured fighting vehicles, personnel carriers, ambulances, motorised water purifiers, patrol boats, mini buses, sniper rifles, machine guns and hand pistols.
Most western countries including the European Union and the United States maintain an arms embargo on Zimbabwe following concerns over human rights abuses.
China has been contracted to build security establishments such as a military college in Harare, the VVIP and Military Referral Hospital at the Manyame Air Force Base, refurbishment of the country’s biggest airport in Harare and parliament building, all installed with surveillance equipment sourced from China.
It is also not the first time Zimbabwe has procured military artillery from China.
In 2008, Zimbabwean authorities took pains to deny claims – confirmed by South African authorities – that a Chinese cargo ship believed to be carrying 77 tonnes of small arms, including more than 3m rounds of ammunition, AK47 assault rifles, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, had docked in the South African port of Durban for transportation of the weapons to Zimbabwe.
Reacting to the donation, former foreign minister Walter Mzembi wrote on X: “A friend who arms you with spears and knobkerries when your house is in conflict is a very bad friend.

Zimbabwe,14557,zimbabwesituation.com,2023-12-18T12:45:24Z,Chinese military donation raises eyebrows,"A RECENT donation of Chinese military hardware to President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government has raised eyebrows as the Asian superpower pushes to further its interests in Zimbabwe.
Mnangagwa received the military hardware on Wednesday last week, with observers arguing that the donation could open floodgates for further Chinese military expansion in southern Africa, where the West also seems to have strong interests.
The equipment included armoured fighting vehicles, personnel carriers, ambulances, motorised water purifiers, patrol boats, minibuses, sniper rifles, machine guns and hand pistols.
The donation was presented to Mnangagwa at Inkomo Mechanised Brigade by the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding, who spoke highly of the two countries’ historical ties.
However, political and social commentators were divided over the donation, with human rights defender and Centre for Natural Resources Governance director Farai Maguwu saying the deal was meant to further the Chinese interest in the mining sector.
Maguwu told NewsDay that China’s donation was driven by interest especially in Zimbabwe’s mineral resources.
“There is no free lunch, nations are driven by interests not love. The most important thing is to find out what the motive behind the donation is. So, when you look at the destructive role of China in Zimbabwe’s mineral sector, it’s not meaningful,” he said.
“The Chinese involved in the mineral sector have not been able to build even a school or clinic in communities they have been working in.”
Maguwu added: “We have not been at war with any country since independence. The real enemy we want to fight today is poverty, climate-induced disasters, droughts, fight against decline in health and education standards, that is what we need.”
Political analyst Tendai Reuben Mbofana said the deal was dishonest and disturbing.
“The deal was an anti-people one. We are looking at a country that is globally known for its poverty, nearly half of the population is living in extreme poverty, we do not have hospitals equipped to serve the people and basic essentials,” he said.
“We do have cancer machines. We do not have ambulances and we have children who are learning under trees because they do not have schools.”
He said the military equipment would not help ordinary Zimbabweans or improve their lives.
“What do we need guns for when our children are languishing in extreme poverty? Who are we fighting? This equipment can be used to kill civilians,” he said.
However, professor of world politics at the University of London Stephen Chan said the donation was of little significance.
“For the most part, the Chinese donation is light tactical skirmishing equipment for border wars — not all of it useful, such as the patrol boats,” he said.
“Zimbabwe’s only real water border is Lake Kariba, and its neighbour on the other side, Zambia, poses no military threat. This is a goodwill gesture from China, probably excess equipment it no longer needs itself.
“Having said that, the motorised water purifiers might have a beneficial non-military use in helping to alleviate the cholera epidemic caused by impure water. For the most part this donation has no global geo-political context.”",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Inkomo Siding', 'Lake Kariba'], 'ZMB': ['Republic of Zambia']}",arms_transfer_security_aid_assistance,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Zimbabwe,6543,zimbabwesituation.com,2016-07-03T12:08:22Z,What Does Japan See in Zimbabwe?,"On June 14, 2016, Zimbabwe and Japan signed a major automobile industry trade deal to ship 10,000 Japanese tractors to Harare and train 40 Zimbabweans in Japanese automobile manufacturing techniques. This deal mirrors similar contracts signed by China, Zimbabwe’s principal Asian partner, and reaffirms Japan’s desire to compete with China for economic influence in sub-Saharan Africa.
Japan’s investment in Zimbabwe’s automobile industry is the latest step towards stronger ties between Tokyo and Harare. In late March, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe signed a 600 million yen ($5.8 million) deal to finance road construction on Zimbabwe’s resource-rich north-south corridor. Japanese Emperor Akihito also welcomed Zimbabwe’s president and first lady to Tokyo, a move that symbolized the growth in Zimbabwe-Japan cooperation.
Even though Japan risks criticism from Western powers who have isolated the Mugabe regime with crippling sanctions, Abe’s outreach to Zimbabwe strategically benefits Japan in two main ways. First, Abe can use a closer partnership with Zimbabwe as a springboard for expanding Japan’s network of allies in sub-Saharan Africa. As an added bonus, by providing Zimbabwe with much-needed foreign capital, Tokyo can gain economic leverage over one of Beijing’s closest African allies. Second, Zimbabwe is a long-standing ally of North Korea. Closer Harare-Tokyo ties could convince Mugabe to break off relations with Pyongyang, a move that would further isolate Kim Jong-un’s increasingly belligerent regime.

Abe’s diplomatic outreach to Zimbabwe benefits Japan’s economy and increases Tokyo’s geopolitical influence in three main ways.
First, despite widespread international criticisms of Robert Mugabe’s authoritarian policies and handling of Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation crisis, Mugabe is respected by many African leaders for his role in liberating Zimbabwe from white minority rule in 1980. Abe’s praise of Mugabe as an “iconic” leader and as the “most revered patriarch of Africa” in late March, was a veiled appeal to African leaders who admire Mugabe for his steadfast resistance to Western neo-colonialism.
Abe has used this good will to curry Mugabe’s support for Japan’s UN reform agenda. During his General Assembly speech last year, Mugabe expressed support for African representation in the UN Security Council. As Mugabe was the chairman of the African Union until January 2016, Japanese policymakers have expressed optimism that Mugabe’s solidarity could inspire other African countries to back Japan’s plan to overhaul the UN Security Council.
Second, Japan is strongly positioned to re-establish trade linkages with Zimbabwe, as it did not follow the West in imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe for Mugabe’s forcible land seizures in 2000. Those sanctions isolated Mugabe diplomatically and economically from the West, forcing Zimbabwe to adopt an Asia-Pacific centered “Look East” foreign policy targeting Chinese foreign investment.
While Japanese companies withdrew in response to rapidly worsening economic conditions in Zimbabwe in the early 2000s, the absence of legal barriers to trade has fueled a revival of Japanese investment under Abe. Major acquisitions like Kansai Paint’s purchase of Zimbabwe’s largest paint company in 2013 have convinced some Japanese business leaders that conditions for investment in Zimbabwe are gradually improving. Abe’s bilateral meetings with Mugabe at the 2013 Tokyo International Conference for Africa’s Development (TICAD) summit, and 2015 UN disaster conference based in Japan have also been helpful in streamlining the inflow of Japanese capital to Zimbabwe.
Mugabe has responded positively to Japan’s diplomatic overtures, and has urged Abe to expand Japan’s investment in Zimbabwe’s gold, platinum, and nickel industries. As Zimbabwe remains a mineral resource-rich country, closer Japanese links to Zimbabwe will allow Tokyo to profit considerably should Zimbabwe’s economy recover.
Third, increased Japanese development assistance could allow Tokyo to challenge China’s dominance over the process of rebuilding Zimbabwe’s economy. China has invested extensively in improving the efficiency of Zimbabwean agriculture to alleviate food shortages. In response to China’s efforts, Abe has announced two major aid pledges to Zimbabwe over the past year. These aid donations strive to increase food production in areas surrounding the north-south corridor infrastructure projects. Through expanded development assistance, Japan can revive the trust and camaraderie that characterized Tokyo’s investments in Zimbabwe during the 1980s, and prove its reliability as an investment provider to other Sub-Saharan African states seeking foreign capital.
How Closer Japan-Zimbabwe Ties Can Help Contain North Korea
Deepening ties between Japan and Zimbabwe could also impact security in the Korean peninsula, as Zimbabwe has historically been one of North Korea’s closest international allies. Mugabe visited North Korea in 1980 shortly after his ascension as prime minister and became an admirer of Kim Il-sung’s cult of personality. Upon his return to Harare, Mugabe distributed Juche: The Speeches and Writings of Kim Il-Sung to Zimbabwean officials and praised the North Korean regime as a model for Zimbabwe’s state-building efforts. Mugabe subsequently hired North Korean military advisers to assist his repression of the Ndebele community from 1983-1987, a crackdown which resulted in at least 20,000 casualties.
While the extent of Zimbabwe’s trade linkages with North Korea is unknown, there is compelling evidence of bilateral cooperation between Mugabe and Kim Jong-un. In 2013, Mugabe agreed to an arms-for-uranium pact with North Korea. This pact allowed the DPRK to send scientists to Zimbabwe’s uranium-rich Kanyema dirstict, and access the yellowcake uranium required for nuclear weapons development. In exchange, Zimbabwe received unspecified quantities of arms and ammunition from Pyongyang.
Japan’s diplomatic overtures toward Zimbabwe occur at a time when North Korea’s long-standing African alliances are being challenged by South Korean President Park Geun-hye’s recent sub-Saharan African tour and offers of investment. The defection of Uganda from Pyongyang’s security umbrella after Park’s visit demonstrated to Japanese policymakers that sustained diplomatic outreach can convince even North Korea’s strongest allies to comply with international sanctions.
Japan’s outreach to Zimbabwe has already made some progress in rupturing the Harare-Pyongyang alliance. While Mugabe’s March 29 statement on Zimbabwe-North Korea relations did not rule out re-establishing diplomatic ties with Kim Jong-un’s regime, the Zimbabwean president admitted that his country had “lost connection with North Korea.”
Symbolic linkages between North Korea and Zimbabwe remain intact, due to Mugabe’s stridently anti-Western foreign policy identity. The DPRK football team trained in Zimbabwe before the 2010 World Cup and Mugabe’s 90th birthday statue, worth $5 million, was constructed by North Korean sculptors. But if Abe can convince Mugabe of Japan’s reliability as a strategic partner at a time when Zimbabwe is suffering from acute international isolation, he might be able to curb future Harare-Pyongyang economic and military cooperation.
Abe’s diplomatic outreach to Zimbabwe is a vital component of Tokyo’s alliance-building strategy in Africa. It is also closely intertwined with Japan’s desire to contain China and North Korea. As Mugabe is 92 years old and has not designated a successor, the long-term future of the Harare-Tokyo partnership remains uncertain. But based on Abe’s recent rhetoric and investment pledges, ties between Japan and Zimbabwe are likely to continue to strengthen for the foreseeable future.

Zimbabwe,9165,chronicle.co.zw,2018-04-03T00:02:38Z,Zimbabwe seeks deeper economic ties with China to boost economy,"President Mnangagwa
President Mnangagwa said on Saturday, Zimbabwe is seeking deeper economic ties with China to leapfrog its economy battered by years of Western sanctions.
He is in China on five-day State visit (April 2-6) at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, marking his first state visit outside Africa as Zimbabwean president since taking office last November.
Speaking to Xinhua before his visit to China, Cde Mnangagwa said his administration’s priority is to revive the economy and make Zimbabwe a middle-class income country by 2030, which needs deeper economic ties with China.
Zimbabwe will seek to tap into the huge financial resources, technical expertise and modern technology of its all-weather friend China, Cde Mnangagwa said.
He said he had chosen China first outside Africa to thank the Asian country for standing by Zimbabwe during its most difficult times.
“I will say thank you not only to the president of China but also the people of China for standing and supporting Zimbabwe during the hard times when the West imposed sanctions on us,” Cde Mnangagwa said.
“I have no doubt that in the economic forum meetings that I am going to address in China, I will be able to invite investors to come to Zimbabwe from China and tell them the opportunities that exist here and the environment, the security of investment that we have created in our own jurisdiction,” he added.
He said Zimbabwe had lost much time concerning its economy and needed to move with speed in embracing new technologies.
Boosting both domestic and foreign direct investment was key to growing the economy, he said.
“The issue is not only about attracting capital into Zimbabwe. It’s an issue of leapfrogging after 18 years of isolation so that we catch up with the rest of the developing countries,” Cde Mnangagwa said.
President Mnangagwa said he will describe his vision for Zimbabwe, as well as targets and challenges to achieve it.
“We must have deeper economic relations with China. We know the road that we need to follow to grow our economy. We have priorities set out and we know the goals that we want to meet,” he said.

Cde Mnangagwa, who came to China for training in the 1960s, said he had great admiration for Xi’s efforts to combat corruption, the same thing he is doing in Zimbabwe, which helps economic development.
Under a 100-day programme, the new Zimbabwe administration implemented reforms including improving the ease of doing business to attract investment.
Zimbabwe’s ruling Zanu-PF party, he said, would continue to learn from the Communist Party of China and deepen relations with it as it has set a perfect example of good leadership to other political parties over the years, and was also one of the political parties that helped Zimbabwe to win independence from Britain in 1980.
China has steadily improved its economic ties with Africa under the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation and Zimbabwe would continue to deepen cooperation with the Asian country under the platform, Cde Mnangagwa said.

HARARE, March 31 (Xinhua) — Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa said Saturday his country is seeking deeper economic ties with China to leapfrog its economy battered by years of Western sanctions.
Mnangagwa will travel to China for a state visit from April 2 to 6 at the invitation of his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, marking his first state visit outside Africa as Zimbabwean president since taking office last November.
Speaking to Xinhua before his visit to China, Mnangagwa said his administration’s priority is to revive the economy and make Zimbabwe a middle-class income country by 2030, which needs deeper economic ties with China.
Zimbabwe will seek to tap into the huge financial resources, technical expertise and modern technology of its all-weather friend China, Mnangagwa said.
He said he had chosen China first outside Africa to thank the Asian country for standing by Zimbabwe during its most difficult times.
“I will say thank you not only to the president of China but also the people of China for standing and supporting Zimbabwe during the hard times when the West imposed sanctions on us,” Mnangagwa said.
“I have no doubt that in the economic forum meetings that I am going to address in China, I will be able to invite investors to come to Zimbabwe from China and tell them the opportunities that exist here and the environment, the security of investment that we have created in our own jurisdiction,” he added.
He said Zimbabwe had lost too much time with its economy and needed to move with speed in embracing new technologies.
Boosting both domestic and foreign direct investment was key to growing the economy, he said.
“The issue is not only about attracting capital into Zimbabwe. It’s an issue of leapfrogging after 18 years of isolation so that we catch up with the rest of the developing countries,” Mnangagwa said.

Africa Moyo Deputy News Editor
ZIMBABWE and China yesterday signed three cooperation agreements focusing on the economy and social services, as the two all-weather friends take their relations to another level. The agreements were signed in Harare after marathon closed discussions between the Zimbabwe delegation headed by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Dr Sibusiso Moyo, and the Chinese economic and trade delegation led by the Vice Minister of Commerce Mr Qian Keming.
In an interview with The Herald after the signing ceremony, Minister Moyo said; “What was being signed here were basically three agreements. The first one, as you are aware, our cooperation between China and Zimbabwe is guided within eight principles and all eight initiatives, and these initiatives are the ones which guide the framework of cooperation, whether it is industrial initiative or it is technological initiative or it’s people-to-people initiative, (or) it is financial initiative.
“This was the implementation of those eight initiatives, which was the basis upon our discussion today, and that was the first agreement which we signed.”
The second agreement relates to the extension of Phase Two of Mahusekwa Hospital while the third agreement is a donation by the Chinese government of US$800 000 towards Cyclone Idai.
Vice Minister Qian said China would pro-actively support Zimbabwe in the Cyclone Idai aftermath rehabilitation make detailed plans under the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (Focac) framework.
Minister Moyo said the relations between Zimbabwe and China “are getting to another level” as they are now focusing on economic reforms being undertaken by Harare.
“We are saying that we want to target specific areas which have got a feel and a touch, which are visible to the people and which do not bring difficulties on the debt management of the country.
“Therefore, we are going to be expanding onto all those areas and thus, we are going to be looking at the financial cooperation so that we can stabilise the financial sector.
“Secondly, we have got to look at the industrial cooperation so that we can look at import substitution and invest, and bring Chinese companies which can establish and retool industries and value add products, which can then be exported, either under industrial parks or under the Special Economic Zones,” said Minister Moyo.
He said Zimbabwe and China are also looking at trade, particularly at this time when trade relations between China and the United States of America are frosty.
Minister Moyo said while the strained relations between the two are unfortunate, Harare believes it can fill that vacuum and increase trade volumes with China.
He said exports in agriculture and other products, emanating from the Special Economic Zones, would be critical in boosting trade between Harare and Beijing.
Zimbabwe and China also spoke about developmental cooperation, focusing on things like drilling of boreholes and support for Cyclone Idai.
Critically, issues giving a symbiotic relationship between China and Zimbabwe such as direct air traffic between the two, came under discussion.
With Air Zimbabwe expecting to take delivery of its two Boeing 777-200ERs in the next few weeks, the company is planning long haul routes to London and Beijing.
Minister Moyo said they also appreciated that China has become the greatest investor so far in the country and is currently implementing “meaningful projects” such as the US$1,5 billion Hwange Thermal power Station expansion project.
The expansion project will see units 7 and 8 being constructed, and will add 600MW of electricity into the national grid.
The project is set to be completed in 42 months.
Minister Moyo said he agreed with Deputy Minister Qian that they “should find ways of quickening” the Hwange 7 and 8 project so that Zimbabwe “can realise the benefit of our cooperation”.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare', 'Mahusekwa'], 'USA': ['United States', 'London']}",trade_agreement_exchange,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

ZIMBABWE is set to enter into a citrus export deal with China as the two countries strengthen their bilateral trade relations, NewsDay has learnt.
The two countries signed the agreement in 2015 as Zimbabwe sought a market for Shashi Citrus smallholder farmers, but China requested post-risk assessment information for the export of fresh citrus fruits from Zimbabwe to China.
In a statement yesterday, Lands and Agriculture minister Anxious Masuka said the export protocol would provide further export markets for local citrus products.
“The trade protocol will cement trade relations between the two nations and will open the door for other products that we were not even exporting, hence will lead to an increase in agricultural contribution to the export basket. For example, Zimbabwe producers have expressed interest in exporting blueberries and avocado pears to China,” he said.
“The trade protocol will broaden the export destinations for Zimbabwe citrus and will remove the over reliance on South African and European markets. The trade protocol will offer Zimbabwe a direct route for our citrus to China and not exporting through South Africa for them to export our citrus as theirs to China.
“Note that China is a huge market and that our current production levels are low. However, the finalisation of the protocol will also provide an impetus towards the conclusion of partnerships and out-grower arrangements with Chinese companies that are eager to export to China.”
He said there was growing demand for citrus fruits in China, which is offering premiums to attract supplies.
The protocol framework, which will be effective for five years, is set to provide technical assistance to Zimbabwe regarding fresh citrus exports to the Chinese market, and will improve local capacity for monitoring and surveillance of citrus plantations for disease control.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'ZAF': ['Republic of South Africa']}",trade_agreement_exchange,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']
Zimbabwe,14077,herald.co.zw,2023-05-30T00:23:32Z,China to enhance economic ties,"Wallace Ruzvidzo-Herald Reporter
ZIMBABWE is committed to enhancing cooperation with China for the mutual benefit of both countries’ people, Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Ambassador Frederick Shava has said.
Speaking following his meeting with Chinese State Councillor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Qin Gang yesterday, Minister Shava said Harare was ready to increase cooperation with Beijing on all fronts, on the back of excellent relations between the two.
He said discussions with Mr Qin had culminated in the exchange of constructive ideas and views which would surely benefit the two nations.
“Over the past few years, especially in the 2nd Republic under the stewardship of the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, His Excellency Cde Dr Emmerson Mnangagwa, and the Chinese President, His Excellency Xi Jinping, the bilateral relations between Zimbabwe and China have soared to greater heights, reflecting the elevation of the Status of the bilateral relations to the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in April 2018.
“Since this elevation, Zimbabwe has witnessed increased investments by the Chinese business community in many areas, including mining, agriculture, energy and manufacturing sectors,” he said.
Ambassador Shava said Harare and Beijing had agreed to exploit trade and economic cooperation as there was vast potential between the two countries.
“We both concurred on the need to boost trade and economic cooperation between our two countries, including enhancing private sector partnerships.”
“Zimbabwe and China signed a Protocol to facilitate the export of Zimbabwean citrus to China and we would like to broaden this list to include macadamia nuts, sesame seeds, blue berries, avocados, dried chillies and other agricultural products. The relevant Zimbabwean authorities are currently engaging their Chinese counterparts on broadening of the products portfolio,” he said.
“We discussed the broadening of cooperation in the tourism and hospitality industry. Zimbabwe recently received the first batch of a group of Chinese tourists in the post-Covid pandemic era earlier this month. I expressed hope that such cooperation would continue to grow into the foreseeable future.”
He apprised his Chinese counterpart on the impending general elections and stressed Government’s commitment to ensuring free, fair and transparent polls.
“I also took the opportunity to inform my colleague and counterpart on the preparations for the forthcoming harmonized elections.
“I think we all can attest that Zimbabwe is very peaceful and stable. I envisage that this atmosphere will subsist during the pre- and post-election period.
“I also noted the cordial relations between the ruling party ZANU-PF and the Communist Party of China (CPC),” he said.
Mr Qin said China was ready to work with Zimbabwe to ensure the continued development of bilateral ties.
“You are a good friend of ours and bilateral relations have been stable, healthy and great since we established diplomatic ties over four decades ago,” he said.
Ambassador Shava will be addressing the Zimbabwe-China Business Forum scheduled to start today and run for three days.

Zimbabwe,14084,herald.co.zw,2023-05-18T00:03:37Z,Zim-China Business Forum set to boost trade relations,"Business Reporter
Zimbabwean firms, in various sectors of the economy, will take advantage of the Zimbabwe-China Business Forum set for Beijing, China, to identify potential areas of trade between the two countries.
The Zimbabwe-China Business Forum scheduled for May 30, 2023 to June 1, 2023, and organised by the national trade development and promotion agency, Zimtrade, provides an opportunity for businesses from both countries to meet in person and build relations and business links.
Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Ambassador Frederick Shava will lead the Zimbabwean delegation attending the business event.
The business forum, which is in line with President Mnangagwa’s policy of engagement and re-engagement, can lead to increased trade and investment, promote economic growth and create new opportunities, which can benefit both economies.
China is Zimbabwe’s third largest trading partner and according to the Chinese Embassy, trade between Zimbabwe and China surged 29,2 percent year-on-year to a record US$2,43 billion in 2022.
Through its Twitter handle, the Chinese Embassy said in January this year that Zimbabwe exported US$1,3 billion worth of goods to China and imported US$1,13 billion worth of goods from China.
Exports to China are however dominated by primary products mainly tobacco leaf, processed tobacco, ferroalloys and chromium ore.
In an interview this week, ZimTrade chief executive officer Allan Majuru said the business forum will go a long way in meeting the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) objective of increasing value-added products from 9 percent of exports to 20 percent of gross domestic product.
Under NDS1, exports are expected to grow to US$14 billion by 2030, which will be a significant contribution to the country’s quest to become an upper-middle-income economy.
“The Government policy of looking east is also what we are looking at to make sure that we benefit from people who are supportive of our policy direction,” said Mr Majuru.
He said while the Covid-19 pandemic had restricted in-person interactions between the business communities in the two countries, the business forum was an opportunity to meet in person, “exchange samples and finalise discussions’.
“It’s difficult to finalise discussions without meeting each other,” Mr Majuru said.
The two countries continue to boost economic and trade ties and over the years, China has made major investments in Zimbabwe’s infrastructure and mining projects.
“China has put in a lot of investment into the country, if you look at mining they have done a lot, but we are also now trying to say we have a lot of manufactured goods that can enter the (Chinese) market competitively,” said Mr Majuru.
He added that the main focus for the Zimbabwe delegation would be to look into how the country can penetrate the Chinese market with its horticulture products.
“For us, our main focus is to look at horticulture, you might be aware that the citrus protocol is about to be finalised, so we also need to prepare for that.
“We did a survey in Beira to see if the logistics can work for us to competitively export citrus using Beira Port to China and that is looking positive as we speak,” Mr Majuru said.
ZimTrade is also looking at other horticulture crops such as blueberries, and avocados and according to Mr Majuru “all those things require protocols to be put in place”.
“But we also need to have an appreciation of what the demand side looks like in China, and also arts and crafts and also leather products.”
Zimbabwe has in the past managed to export to China but going forward, according to Mr Majuru, there was need to make sure “we group together our SMEs so that there is a consistent supply of goods”.
“Our SMEs in the crafts and also leather sectors are scattered so we want to have the demand side pull them so that they are organized, so we are also going to look into that.”
Apart from looking for export opportunities, the business forum will also be used to help manufacturers source equipment and machinery.
“Remember we are using equipment that is dilapidated and that affects our competitiveness, so China is a good source of equipment.
“We are going to be inviting manufacturers of machinery and equipment to this business forum so that they can engage with our manufacturers,” Mr Majuru said.
The event will see delegates from both public and private sectors discussing issues in the agriculture, mining, manufacturing and tourism sectors.
In agriculture, discussions around horticulture and the value addition of tobacco and cotton will be key.
“China is the biggest buyer of our tobacco, so we are going to have sessions to address issues in tobacco, and cotton, and here we are talking about value addition.
“And also our sesame and we have clusters here that are already exporting to China, so we need support in terms of contractual arrangement so that we can increase production, so agriculture is going to be looked at,” said Mr Majuru.
There will also be sessions on mining where China has significant presents in the country and has recently invested in lithium and steel production.
“China is one of the biggest investors in mining so we like that to keep on coming but also with the focus on value addition,” said Majuru.
Tourism is also key and the business forum will have a session that will look at tourism “so that we also market, not only Victoria Falls but the destinations that the Chinese, when they come through, can benefit from”.
Apart from seminars, the Zimbabwe delegation will also conduct site visits to potential suppliers and potential buyers of products.

Zimbabwe,8040,zimbabwesituation.com,2017-06-05T08:14:46Z,‘Chinese might drive away voters’,"INHERENT mistrust of the Chinese might have negative effects on the upcoming biometric voter registration exercise, the opposition MDC-T party has said.
BY RICHARD CHIDZA
Party secretary-general, Douglas Mwonzora was reacting to reports that Chinese firm Laxton Group Limited had won the tender to supply biometric voter registration kits to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec).
The Chinese firm outbid Demalog Identification System of Germany.
“We (political parties) observed the assessment process and our recommendation was that the tender be awarded to Demalog Identification Systems of Germany. It appears the final decision was made by the State Procurement Board (SPB). It is a sinister plot by Zec, working in cahoots with Zanu PF, to scare away potential voters from registering,” Mwonzora said.
“There is so much distrust of the Chinese in our country, hence, the choice of a company from that country could lead to apathy. But we are urging our people to go out in their numbers to register as voters. It is the only way we can defeat this crooked system.”
Zec chairperson, Rita Makarau said the terms of the agreement were still being worked out.
“We are still negotiating the terms of the agreement and an announcement to the public on when registration will begin will be made,” she said yesterday.
On accusations that the Chinese company had been thrust on Zec by the SPB, Makarau said: “No comment! Please talk to the SPB.”
In a message to opposition supporters, Mwonzora said: “First, it is a clear directive from the SPB, which is appointed by the Zanu PF government. Secondly it is a perpetuation of the friendship between Zanu PF and the Communist Party of China.
“However, the main reason for this unmeritorious award is to discourage our people from voting in numbers, as this would signal the end of Zanu PF. Our plea is that we must convert the disadvantage into an advantage.
“We need to unite more than ever to protect our vote. No amount of thuggery, forgery, fraud or subterfuge can stop an idea whose hour has come.”
Zec initially announced voter registration would begin in May, but has since failed to meet the deadline.
Pressure has been mounting on the election management body to announce the winner of the controversial bid, with pro-democracy groups threatening court action amid fears the process was being manipulated.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'DEU': ['Federal Republic of Germany']}",surveillance,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese']

Zimbabwe,9558,theindependent.co.zw,2018-06-01T13:35:44Z,Big brother is busy scanning your face,"Last year, I spent several weeks in a fascinating city called Jinhua in eastern China’s Zhejiang province. The prefecture-level metropolis is easily the Asian country’s richest region in terms of per capita income and other indicators of human development.
If you want to see how China has spectacularly leapfrogged the powerful nations of Europe to become—within a few decades—the world’s second biggest economy, this is the place to visit.
During my stay in Jinhua, I had the opportunity to tour the premises of a large corporation in the digital security sector. The company is in the business of installing and maintaining public surveillance cameras across most parts of the city. The vast web of cameras keeps watch over the sprawling urban zone, providing a live feed of virtually everything that happens in public. Seated in the company’s state-of-the-art control room, you can witness, in real-time, a car accident, a robbery, or two lovers stealing a kiss on the banks of the Wu River.
The public surveillance cameras can be a useful tool for urban planners who seek economic data on traffic volumes or in deciding where to provide new street lighting and other public amenities. In that sense, the technology offers remarkable convenience.
But there is a flip side. Public surveillance cameras make it easier for the authorities to crush dissent and violate civil liberties by thwarting protests and snooping on perceived enemies of the state. This raises the “big brother” spectre of George Orwell’s 1984. Life under the jackboot of permanent surveillance is not my idea of fun.
I am raising this issue after hearing that the government of Zimbabwe recently entered into what has been described as “a strategic partnership” with a Chinese company, CloudWalk Technology, to embark on a large-scale facial recognition programme in this country. The firm uses “3D structured light facial recognition technology”. With such technology, it is possible to establish a person’s national identification particulars, for instance, by just digitally analysing a picture showing thousands of faces at a political rally.
The agreement is backed by the Chinese government and, as it transpires, the technology will be used primarily for law enforcement and security. There is also an understanding, as part of the deal, that the scope of the facial recognition project could be expanded as the Zimbabwean government sees fit.
In the wrong hands, such technology can become an instrument of oppression. Besides, it’s difficult to ignore all the legal, constitutional, ethical and moral questions that inevitably arise. Is it right and proper, for example, for the government to surrender the personal data of citizens to a private company that is not accountable to anyone?
What will stop an illiberal government from using such technology to persecute critics, dissenters, activists and journalists?
Law-abiding citizens deserve protection from Stalinist demagogues and the best way of achieving this is through eternal vigilance, legislative safeguards and judicial restraint.",1,,,"{'None': ['Europe'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe']}",surveillance,['CloudWalk'],['CloudWalk'],"['Zhejiang', 'CloudWalk']","['Zhejiang', 'CloudWalk', 'China']"
Zimbabwe,9742,newsday.co.zw,2018-08-31T00:00:00Z,Chinese company to mount surveillance cameras,"ARTIFICIAL Intelligence (AI) technology will soon be applied on local roads after President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Tuesday gave a nod to a Chinese company, Hikvision, and a local start-up to mount high-tech surveillance cameras on some sections of Harare’s streets in a bid to curb road accidents.
BY STAFF REPORTER
In addition to preventing traffic infractions, the surveillance system can also be used to curb other forms of crime such as robbery.
Among the products that were being showcased at the launch, the traffic surveillance cameras, which work well even during the night, became an instant hit with delegates after officials from the company showcased some of the unsettling traffic accidents captured at a road intersection in the capital recently.
Speaking at the launch of the cutting-edge security products, Mnangagwa said government would support such initiatives as they help bring economic growth.
“We must, as we move forward, be pro-active, bold and seek to chart new frontiers in our development.
Let us all within our respective fields create a deliberate environment where talent is supported and promoted,” he said.
“Our quest to modernise the economy requires high-level security systems.
In this regard, CCTV surveillance systems are, indeed, an important component of any modern society.
Not only are these systems a forensic tool, but they can also be integrated with other monitoring devices, alarm systems and access control devices, thus helping security personnel to identify and interrupt security breaches as they occur or even before they take place.
“Initiatives such as this one and the promotion of a broad array of IT applications will cumulatively contribute to the national security situation in the whole country. My government will, therefore, give you all the support you require,” he said.
The high definition surveillance cameras are distributed in the country by Hikvision’s local partner, Nations Hardware and Electrical.
Nations Hardware managing director Rashid Materia said the technology was based on installing special sensors at junctions to figure out the speed of vehicles and the distance remaining for vehicles to cross the signal.
“Through using AI technology, the driver will be alerted before arriving at the junction to be cautious of a vehicle about to jump the red light signal,” he said.
“This will require a connected infrastructure and city so they can navigate safely around their surroundings. We are able to provide that through our connected safety systems.”
Zimbabwe records an average of 2 000 deaths due to road traffic accidents, according to figures from the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.
The loss from traffic accidents amounts to $400 million a year, an equivalent of 3% of the country’s gross domestic product.
The loss is due to deaths, injuries and property losses.

Zimbabwe,10584,newzimbabwevision.com,2019-06-28T08:46:03Z,"‘ZIMBABWE DEVELOPS ALGORITHMIC SURVEILLANCE , worth millions funded by China, Japan and Iran, monopolising power’","They need from big technology companies to implement trials of the system,”
In a bid to attain political omnipresence and omniscience against unsuspecting citizens, the Zimbabwe government is reportedly working on a sophisticated algorithmic super surveillance system, said to be a first of it’s kind in Africa worth millions of dollars, with the help of China, Japan and Iran, raising fears of a brewing police state, Spotlight Zimbabwe, has been told.
Algorithmic surveillance, is the use of computer programs to identify data of interest from a population. Algorithms are recipes for the internet, and are mostly used in search engines, spam filters, video games, recommendation engines, social media, news feeds and maps. They are often invisible, and have divided opinion, with some believing that they will be of benefit to humans and society, while others worry that it will be the opposite.Opponents of President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s regime said, the fact that the internet can, through algorithms, be used to almost read peoples minds means there is risk for political and economic manipulation, including lack of privacy and self-determination. According to intelligence sources working at the E-Government department or unit, which is basically a branch of the President’s Office, the Chinese are the backbone of the surveillance project, and have Artificial Intelligence (AI) firms that have signed agreements with Mnangagwa’s government, to enable Harare capabilities in setting up massive real-time video surveillance, facial recognition technology for the whole population, including other biometric identification programs. “Zimbabwe is being used as an experiment for algorithmic surveillance in Africa and your government is receiving all the funding they need from big technology companies to implement trials of the system,” said a diplomat who represented a Scandinavian country in the capital before recently being moved to South Africa.
“There is a lot of business and money to be made. Forget about privacy and violation of human rights. Welcome to the brave new world. Zimbabwe will be used as a case study and template for other nations in Africa to follow suit. China, Japan and Iran are involved, and they will obviously get lucrative contracts for their firms to do business with Zimbabwe.”
In March 2018, the Zimbabwean government signed a strategic partnership with the Gunagzhou-based startup CloudWalk Technology to begin a large-scale facial recognition program throughout the country. The agreement, backed by the Chinese government’s Belt and Road initiative, will see the technology primarily used in security and law enforcement and will likely be expanded to other public programs, according to China’s Global Times daily tabloid newspaper.
“The Zimbabwean government did not come to Guangzhou purely for AI or facial ID technology, rather it had a comprehensive package plan for such areas as infrastructure, technology and biology,” CloudWalk CEO Yao Zhiqiang told the newspaper.
Also in August last year Mnangagwa gave the greenlight to another Chinese company, Hikvision, to start mounting high-tech surveillance cameras in the streets of Harare ostensibly to curb road accidents and crime.
“We must, as we move forward, be pro-active, bold and seek to chart new frontiers in our development,” Mnangagwa said during a launch ceremony of Hikvision’s security products.
“Let us all within our respective fields create a deliberate environment where talent is supported and promoted. Our quest to modernise the economy requires high-level security systems. In this regard, CCTV surveillance systems are, indeed, an important component of any modern society. Not only are these systems a forensic tool, but they can also be integrated with other monitoring devices, alarm systems and access control devices, thus helping security personnel to identify and interrupt security breaches as they occur or even before they take place,” he said.
Japan only last month, through her Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Toshiyuki Iwado, pledged to support Zimbabwe in areas of technology, and infrastructural development. The Asian technological powerhouse extended a $3.6 million grant to Zimbabwe last November, which will be used for the acquisition of “cyber security equipment”.
Iwado said some of the new equipment to be provided which includes digital forensic tools, face recognition systems and an information sharing platform, will contribute to upgrading the capacity of the Zimbabwe Republic Police, and help promote inter-regional cooperation of the responsible bodies under the auspices of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol).
Iran, another close ally of Harare has since 2007 been involved in a massive cyber training exercise of hundreds of Zimbabwe’s intelligence and military operatives. Under the leadership of former president, Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe is thought to have acquired state of the art software from Iran, which has been upgraded under Mnangagwa’s watch to snoop on the internet.
Tehran has developed one of the world’s most sophisticated mechanisms for controlling and censoring the internet, enabling the regime to examine the content of individual online communications at a grand scale, after courting the assistance of some European telecommunications companies in developing its monitoring capabilities.
Through a technique called “deep packet inspection”, Iran’s sophisticated mechanisms of controlling the internet enables government authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it, to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for propaganda purposes, which is a dream come true for government’s egregious security law, The Interception of Communications Act passed in 2007 to allow government to wiretape all communications of the populace, without their consent or notification. The law empowers the chief of defense intelligence, the director-general of the CIO, the commissioner of police and the commissioner general of the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) to intercept telephonic, e-mail and cellphone messages
Spotlight Zimbabwe, revealed last March , that Mnangagwa’s administration was on the brink of launching a sophisticated national spying facility, said to be similar in function to the National Security Agency (NSA) in the U.S, aimed at boosting homeland security and to fight cyber crimes and cyber warfares, with the closet assistance of Beijing, Moscow and Tehran. The facility, once in place is capable of monitoring landline phones, mobile and all internet communications, like the NSA located in Fort Meade, Maryland, high level sources within the Information Communication Technology and Cyber Security ministry disclosed last year.
Officials at the E-Government unit yesterday said the new algorithmic surveillance system expected to be up and running by 2023, will be married together with the spy facility established to fight cyber warfares internally and externally, and that the President’s Office is coordinating the project together with a new cyber division in the ministry of defence.

Zimbabwe,10920,zimbabwesituation.com,2019-10-10T10:52:44Z,"Zimbabwe bill clamps down on social media, porn with China tech","Mnangagwa said last week the bill has to be fast-tracked to protect Zimbabwe’s “cyber-space”. However, there is wide-spread sentiment the law is being pushed through to deal with potential uprisings, especially as public anger against the government’s austerity measures.
The bill has been criticized for infringing on civil liberties if it becomes law and there are fears from rights and democracy campaigners it could also strengthen any government bid to snoop on private communications of citizens. It sets out penalize people for generation and distribution of “data concerning an identifiable person knowing it to be false and intending to cause psychological or economic” harm.
The bill was first mulled under the late former leader, Robert Mugabe in 2016 and took hold in 2017 after major protests against Mugabe and economic decline using the #tajamuka, #Mugabemustgo and #thisflag banners and tags broke out in Harare.
Some Zimbabweans are also worried Mnangagwa is pushing the bill to become law so he can use it to deal with potential uprisings fueled through social media.
WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook have become key platforms for spreading information about protests in Zimbabwe and elsewhere in Africa. WhatsApp in particular, is very well used in Zimbabwe, where it accounts for nearly 50% of all internet use in the country.
Zimbabwean government officials have long complained these platforms are being abused to spread false news, most of which is deemed by authorities to be offensive. Mnangagwa’s government ordered a social media black-out in January this year after deadly protests rocked major urban centers following a massive fuel price hike.
The Cyber Crime and Cyber Security Bill “seeks to combat cyber-crime and increase cyber security” and to foster “data protection with due regard to constitutional rights and public interest” said justice minister Ziyambi Ziyambi in his presentation of the bill to cabinet. It will also provision for the setting up of a data protection authority and data security center.
The controversial bill has, however, been welcomed in some circles, especially on the principle of “curbing the transmission of pornographic material” in the Zimbabwean context where revenge pornography leaks have become common. The Human Rights Forum of Zimbabwe said earlier this year that revenge pornography was a form of gender-based violence, hence its call for laws to regulate the transmission of pornography.
Analysts in Zimbabwe such as Pedzisai Ruhanya of the Zimbabwe Democracy Institute believe Mnangagwa’s administration will lean on China for technology and expertise to monitor and regulate social media data under the new cyber-crime law. Zimbabwe has already worked with Chinese technology for facial recognition technology which has been deployed at the country’s borders as well as well as anti-poaching and wildlife monitoring equipment in the Manna Pools resort.
“The technology will likely be Chinese and so will be the expertise for this project (social media regulation). And it’s probably to deal with protests and uprisings,” said Ruhanya.",1,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",surveillance,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']
Zimbabwe,11109,thezimbabwean.co,2019-12-02T11:46:00Z,Zimbabwe Is Trying to Build a China Style Surveillance State,"The end of Robert Mugabe’s brutal 37-year dictatorship over Zimbabwe in 2017 was greeted by scenes of wild jubilation on the streets of Harare by people who’d seen their dream of independence from minority white rule turned into tyranny under the aging dictator’s leadership.But it was on social media that Zimbabweans first found their voice to rise up against the 93-year-old strongman, with platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter proving to be vital in mobilizing and coordinating countrywide protests.Now, just two years later, activists say the government that replaced Mugabe’s is trying to silence those same social media accounts with legislation that bears all the hallmarks of China’s dystopian censorship and surveillance system.Zimbabwe’s Parliament is weighing legislation that would authorize the use of surveillance technologies, grant sweeping powers to crack down on social media users, and allow the government to snoop on citizens’ private communications. The latest version of the bill — known as the Cyber Crime, Cyber Security and Data Protection Bill of 2019 — was passed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s Cabinet last month and is currently being drafted for publication and approval by Parliament, where it’s expected to easily pass under Mnangagwa’s Zanu-PF party majority.Activists warn things could get ugly soon after that.“It is a terrifying piece of legislation,” Bekezela Gumbo, a researcher at the Zimbabwe Democracy Institute, told VICE News. “It has everything it needs to give the ruling Zanu-PF party and its agents in government the legal basis to imprison opponents using the internet.”Although the public still doesn’t know exactly what the final version of the bill will contain, activists say it’ll likely be overly broad and lacking the sort of necessary protections that rights groups have called for in the past.“The definitions of crimes were described in such broad terms that they could arrest people because they have said something on a social media platform to criticize the government or say something that is unfair to government,” Kuda Hove, a legal expert with the Media Institute of Southern Africa, told VICE News, referring to a previous draft of the bill he’d seen.Back in 2016, social media was the spark for the protests that would ultimately lead to Mugabe’s ouster in 2017. It was on Facebook, Twitter, and critically WhatsApp that the genesis of the protest movement began to take shape.At the time, WhatsApp accounted for over one-third of all mobile data used in Zimbabwe as citizens shared anti-government news and information about demonstrations.Officials were powerless at the time to stop the surge in online dissent, and they began exploring ways to curb it. It was during that period, as Mugabe was losing his grip on power, that the first version of the Computer Crime and Cyber Crime Bill was drafted.Since Mugabe’s departure, the bill has seen a number of revisions. The most recent version remains shrouded in mystery, but it includes a vague mandate to protect “cyberspace,” according to Mnangagwa.The president’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the latest bill approved by the Cabinet. The only official who would speak was Ivanhoe Gurira, the principal director at the Ministry of Information, who denied the bill was meant to promote censorship, claiming Zimbabwe has other laws that help protect access to information and freedom of speech.When asked about the criticism from activists about the new law, Gurira said: “Only those people that want to operate outside the law would say so.”But Mnangagwa’s government has already shown its willingness to restrict online speech.In January, the government partially shut off internet access and blocked access to social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Tinder. The move came as the government struggled to contain protests over a sharp spike in fuel prices and generally deteriorating economic conditions. The internet shutdown was soon followed by a brutal military crackdown that left a dozen people dead and over 170 more injured.Access to the internet was restored a week later, but only after the High Court ruled the government’s order was illegal. Free speech activists say the new cybercrime bill would essentially make another shutdown legal.“With such precedent, it is indubitable that the underlying intention of the proposed law is to curtail citizens’ fundamental political and civil liberties, especially as government battles to contain the tanking economy and rising citizens agitation,” Nhlanhla Ngwenya, program director at the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa, told VICE News.The government has also arrested numerous individuals for online activities since Mnangagwa came to power, including Evan Mawarire, a pastor who was charged with inciting public violence after he posted messages in support of the labor protests on Facebook and Twitter.“We’re in a country where the basic freedoms that are provided for in the constitution for citizens are being blatantly violated. People are not allowed to speak freely. The amount of arrests that have taken place of people who have spoken out or against the government is shocking,” Mawarire told CNN this week.Now, under Mnangagwa’s rule, the government is hoping to expand its crackdown on free speech online — and to do that it’s taking its lead from the world’s worst abuser of the internet: China.China and Zimbabwe have long and deep ties that stretch back decades and run to the very highest levels of government.Many of Zimbabwe’s senior leaders, including Mnangagwa and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, received military training in China back in the early 1960s.“You can’t overstate how deep the ties go between these two governments,” Eric Olander, managing editor of the nonpartisan China Africa Project, told VICE News. “They go back a long way together and there’s no indication either side is wavering in their mutual commitment to one another.”On the technology front, China is already helping the Zimbabwe government keep a closer eye on its citizens. As part of Beijing’s $71 million Belt and Road investment in the country, the Zimbabwe government has partnered with Chinese facial recognition company CloudWalk Technology to create a surveillance network similar to the one deployed to monitor Uighurs in Xinjiang.The deal sees CloudWalk technology monitoring major transport hubs and using the data to build a national facial recognition database. The deal also gives the Chinese company access to a rich trove of data on African faces.Critics worry the new cybersecurity law would augment this nascent surveillance network by monitoring citizens’ online activities as well as their offline movements. And while China’s involvement in Zimbabwe’s surveillance plans remain far from clear, experts expect Harare to lean heavily on Beijing’s expertise to roll it out.“We probably don’t need a lot of evidence to draw the conclusion that China will likely lend its expertise to building this kind of digital surveillance, given the trust that exists between these two governments and China’s expertise in this area,” Olander said. “Plus, the Chinese have an entire mechanism in place to provide the financing, implementation, and training on how to use technology like this.”In fact, the Zimbabwean government may have already been inspired by China during the drafting of the new legislation. Officials from the Zimbabwean government were among representatives from three dozen countries who travelled to China in recent years to for weeks-long seminars on information management, according to Sarah Cook, a senior China researcher with Freedom House.With China’s expertise, Mnangagwa’s government could get closer to stemming the sort of upheaval that toppled his predecessor before it even begins.“This law is a response to the use of social media by activists, citizen journalists, and researchers during protests, accountability monitoring, and political mobilization,” Gumbo said. “This is what the government doesn’t want, and the bill is a mechanism to avoid public scrutiny.

Zimbabwe,11674,thestandard.co.zw,2020-06-21T00:00:00Z,Privacy violations fears grow as govt sets surveillance cameras in cities,"news in depth:BY DUMISANI NDLELA
Zimbabwe is planning to link its proposed National Data Centre with databases and information from the country’s key economic players and state institutions as the country prepares for the creation of smart cities equipped with surveillance technologies, The Standard has learnt.
This is part of an ambitious Smart Zimbabwe blueprint expected to transform urban areas into smart cities that use information and communication technologies (ICT) to increase efficiency and drive economic growth, according to a government master plan seen by this newspaper.
But there are concerns over issues of privacy, particularly given that the National Data Centre will have a large cache of citizens’ private, personal data.
“All data and information from government and sectors of the economy should be stored in databases that are networked and linked to the National Data Centre facilities,” the government master plan, expected to run from January 2020 to the end of 2030, said.
Consultants from Huawei Technologies, one of the companies helping with the building of the critical infrastructure for the smart cities project, have advised government on digitalising the national registration system for birth and identity documents, according to a source.
This would ensure that citizens’ details, such as their names, gender, date of birth, identification number and photos, are linked with the National Data Centre.
Linking this to the surveillance system will ensure easy identification of criminals once they come within range of the surveillance cameras.
This suggests that Zimbabwe is likely to follow the Chinese model, which has completely transformed the Asian country through artificial intelligence (AI) systems that have also been used to create a massive surveillance state.
There are fears that due to weak data laws in the country, there may be breach of personal data privacy, and abuse of personal data by the State to monitor citizens.
Stored personal data, which can include sensitive personal information, can be analysed without the authority of the courts, or even without reasonable suspicion of affected individuals, critics argue.
The recent disclosure of telecommunication details of three MDC-A activists — MP Joana Mamombe, and party youths Cecilia Chimbiri and Netsai Marova — who claimed to have been abducted and tortured by alleged state security agents, has reinforced fears that surveillance systems could also be used to monitor activists and political opponents.
Home Affairs minister Kazembe Kazembe recently disclosed alleged telecommunication details and locations of the three activists during the period they allege to have been abducted as he sought to dismiss their claims that they were abducted by the state.
The disclosure triggered a furore from human rights activists, who argued that this infringed on privacy as well as illegal surveillance of citizens.
Among the economic players that will link their databases to the National Data Centre are financial institutions.
A source said banks are already benefiting from personal data from the national registry for risk control.
Any collaboration with government and its institutions would, therefore, be a quid pro quo (a favour or advantage granted in return for something) arrangement, the source said.
Moreover, banks appear to be in better stead to help in the drive to create smart cities because of their financial wherewithal and their interaction with other economic agencies, a banker said.
They have extensive data from transactions, risk control and customer photographs that are critical to the surveillance system.
Many of the domestic banks are moving away from the brick-and-mortar model to digital banking platforms.
A few of them have started investing in AI software to enhance their products.
Over the past few weeks, many banks issued notices that they had gone paperless, with paper-based transactions no longer accepted at banking halls for bank-to-bank transfers and internal transfers.
Customers, the banks said, were to sign up for Internet banking and mobile payment platforms, which now form part of a cocktail of digital payment platforms offered to customers.
While the move by the banks was part of measures to combat the spread of Covid-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus that broke out in China in December last year and has spread globally mainly through person-to-person contact, sources said the banks were in fact following a broader plan by government to develop smart cities equipped with modern technologies.
At the centre of this ambitious government project will be collection of large amounts of personal data, the centrepiece of smart cities.
In his 2020 national budget presentation, Finance minister Mthuli Ncube said construction of the National Data Centre was nearing completion.
He said the centre would consolidate “services, applications and infrastructure to provide efficient electronic services among government departments, between government and citizens as well as between businesses and government”.
The government blueprint said it expected the Smart Zimbabwe project to deliver a digital government, economy and society, with a promise to ensure that “digitalised content (is) accessed by all through the National Data Centre”.
To achieve these goals, government intends to ensure adequate infrastructure is put in place, such as reliable electricity provision, good road networks, water and sanitation, equipping government with ICT equipment and improving the telecommunications network.
The country’s key electricity generation plants are being renovated and expanded, thanks to Chinese funding, which has also supported massive investment in telecommunications and ICT infrastructure over the past decade.
Although work on the upgrade of Harare’s waterworks has been stalled, the Chinese had extended a US$144 million loan to enable the capital to revamp its water supply and sanitation system.
The project was expected to cascade into several others in various other towns and cities.
Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant that has helped build the backbone infrastructure for the surveillance system, last year completed a US$98 million fibre optic project for the state-owned TelOne linking Harare and Bulawayo, the country’s two major cities, with South Africa.
The project was funded by China Exim Bank, currently bankrolling a network expansion project also being undertaken by Huawei for mobile telecommunications network, NetOne.
The Chinese telecoms giant also helped construct two data centres for TelOne, as part of the US$98 million facility.
The two centres — one in the capital and another in Mazowe just outside the capital — will be linked to the National Data Centre.
At the launch of the TelOne data centres, former ICT minister Supa Mandiwanzira said these were “in sync with the big data era that the country has entered into, making such facilities indispensable”.
Indeed, smart cities are about big data. In its master plan, the government said data and information in the smart cities would be collected through an integrated set of sensors strategically located throughout the city and monitored through a network operating centre.
The data and information collected from citizens by city authorities “through specific and secure applications such as health, traffic management and waste management” would be stored in databases and city data centres, the master plan said.
ICT, Postal and Courier Services minister Jenfan Muswere said in an interview that government had rolled out surveillance cameras in the capital.
The cameras, which use facial recognition technology, use biometric software application capable of distinctively recognising individuals using data captured from people’s faces.
It can accurately and quickly identify target individuals once they come within range of the cameras.
“The ministry, working closely with TelOne and Harare City Council, has already embarked on a safe city project where camera technology is being used to monitor human and motor traffic,” Muswere said.
Muswere could neither confirm nor deny the involvement of Huawei in setting up infrastructure for surveillance system in Harare, saying “any progressive companies are welcome to do business in the country”.
“However, any engagements will be done following the stipulated government procedures and any agreed developments will be communicated in due time via the appropriate channels,” he said.
City council officials, speaking on condition they were not identified, suggested that Huawei could already be working on a surveillance project parallel to the one involving TelOne and the City of Harare.
It involved state security agencies being led by the military, one source said.
That the Zimbabwean government is working with Huawei to build the backbone infrastructure for the surveillance system in the country is not in doubt.
Government also signed a strategic agreement for cooperation on a mass facial recognition surveillance project with Chinese artificial intelligence firm Cloudwalk, and has been harvesting data at the country’s airports, State facilities and border points using facial recognition cameras with deep learning capacity supplied by Cloudwalk as well as another Chinese AI firm, HikVision.
The cameras were also deployed in the eastern border town of Mutare, where government launched the city’s Smart City project in January, according to reports.
The government master plan promises that data privacy and protection will be one of the cornerstones of the Smart Zimbabwe initiative.
The initiative will usher in smart cities, smart borders, smart education, smart agriculture, smart health, smart transport, smart mining, smart commerce, smart trade and commerce and smart government.
The master plan promises to deliver “smart government, (which) is also about improving democratic processes and transforming the ways that public services are delivered”.
“Smart government, therefore, is a new way of governance relying on information and communication technologies and it is citizen-centric, data-driven and performance-focused,” the document said.
Muswere said smart cities would be covered by a number of regulations under e-governance and the proposed Cyber Security and Data Protection Bill, which was gazetted recently and tabled before Parliament for debate, was “one of the laws”.
“The citizens’ rights to privacy are adequately covered bearing in mind that extensive consultations were conducted before gazetting and again the Bill will go for public hearing where citizens’ views will be taken into account,” he said.
Muswere said section 51 of the constitution, which guarantees the right to human dignity, had been taken into account in coming up with the Bill, whose objective is to increase cyber security and data protection.
In a review of the Cyber Security and Data Protection Bill, the Media Institute of Southern Africa (Misa) Zimbabwe said while the processing of sensitive information, genetic data, biometric data and health data would be prohibited under the Bill, there were exceptions where the processing was necessary to comply with national security laws and prevention of imminent danger or mitigation of specific criminal offences.
“It should be noted that Zimbabwe has a history of surveillance through its laws that seek to promote national security like the Official Secrets Act and the Interceptions of Communications Act,” Misa-Zimbabwe said.
“These laws are not aligned to the constitution and have provisions that continue to violate the exercise of rights.”
The organisation said in circumstances where national security was cited, there was often no disclosure of sufficient information under the auspices of national interests.
“This poses the danger of such provisions being abused and exposing citizens to over-surveillance by government and state security agents, thus, violating their right to privacy,” said Misa-Zimbabwe.
Apparently, some jurisdictions like the European Union (EU) have developed privacy laws that specifically punish any breaches of privacy by data centres.
For example, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives people more control over their data, and any breach is punishable by up to €20 million, or 4% of the worldwide annual revenue of the prior financial year, whichever is higher.
To comply with GDPR, many data centres have enshrined the rights of individuals in their systems, such as the right to be informed about how their data will be used, their access to the data and how it is processed, the right to rectification of the data, the right to restrict processing and the right to object to processing of their personal data.
Misa-Zimbabwe said the Cyber Security and Data Protection Bill had made provision for the processing of data, which included alterations.
But the media advocacy group noted: “More recently, Finance minister Mthuli Ncube, at a post-cabinet briefing on the economic relief for Covid-19, said government had used ‘a sophisticated algorithm’, which used bank accounts and also relied on mobile numbers to access the locations of individuals.
“In this regard, there was need to notify the data subjects prior to the collection of this information as well as clear information on how the data was processed.”
Muswere insisted that the Smart Zimbabwe blueprint was very clear about the need for privacy and security of data.
“The blueprint identifies the security of communications infrastructure and platforms as a key pillar.
“Security of data on these platforms is definitely a priority for us,” he said.

Zimbabwe,11822,chronicle.co.zw,2020-08-04T00:01:42Z,Bulawayo and Chinese firm partner to introduce facial recognition scan system,"Pamenus Tuso, Business Correspondent
A BULAWAYO-based company Brains at Work Consulting (Private) Limited has entered into a partnership with a Chinese company, Clou Global Technology, to solely distribute the latter’s facial recognition system integrated with temperature scan.
The innovative Chinese-made product is already being sold in China, Europe, Nigeria and Mozambique as part of efforts to mitigate the risks of Covid-19.
Brains at Work Consulting recently signed a formal distributorship agreement with the Chinese company to exclusively distribute the product in the country.
“We have partnered the manufacturer to make this product available. This system is suitable for office areas, hotels, automatic gates, office buildings, schools, public services and other places where face recognition system and body temperature measurement are required,” said Brains at Work Consulting chief executive officer, Mr Witker Tholana, in an interview.
Clou Face and Body Temperature System can help recognise a person with abnormal temperature or who is not registered to enter at a particular place easily.
“Basically, this system was designed to mitigate the risks of Covid-19 in public institutions and individual households but the system can also be used to profile employees, clocking at work, to capture face data base for employees and can be integrated with security companies systems,” said Mr Tholana.
He said his company will provide the Application Programming Interface (API) for free to enable an interface to security systems. The local firm’s logo will also be embedded in the software system, he said.
The system also comes imbedded with a WiFi module and external hotspot module.
Mr Tholana said the system is affordable and it takes about a day to install.
“The device is fairly cheap and the price is almost equivalent to that of an I-phone. It takes a day only to install but it takes three to four weeks to deliver the gadget from China,” he added.",1,,,"{'None': ['Europe'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'NGA': ['Federal Republic of Nigeria'], 'MOZ': ['Republic of Mozambique'], 'ZWE': ['Bulawayo']}",surveillance,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

Zimbabwe,13639,theindependent.co.zw,2022-07-15T11:43:58Z,Spotlight on new parly security checks,"JULIA NDLELA/TINASHE KAIRIZA
CHINA has implored Zimbabwe to conduct an independent security assessment at the US$100 million new parliament building it erected on the outskirts of Harare, it has emerged.
Overtures by China, which will soon be handing over the parliament building situated in Mt Hampden, about 18 kilometres from the capital Harare, are meant to calm fears that the Asian giant has intentions to snoop on Zimbabwe.
Fears that Beijing could potentially use the new parliament building to spy on Harare follow allegations that China bugged the African Union (AU) headquarters it built and paid for in the Ethiopian capital in 2018.
But the AU dismissed the reports as patently false. Beijing also refuted the spying allegations.
In the case of Zimbabwe, the Chinese embassy told the Zimbabwe Independent this week that Beijing offered Harare an opportunity to carry out surveillance and security checks on the soon to be commissioned Parliament building.
The request was extended to Local Government and Public Works ministry, headed by July Moyo.
A Chinese embassy official, Liang Zhizun said in an interview that as normal procedure, the embassy had requested the Zimbabwe government to conduct independent and thorough information technology (IT), data and all other necessary security inspection on the building before a formal hand-over.
“The audio, video and IT system will be managed and controlled by (a) Zimbabwean team in the future running of the building. A few rumours say that China would bug the new parliament building are outdated and low ranked trick played by some foreign countries who are not happy to see any achievements in China-African co-operation,” Zhizun said.
“The same rumours occurred on the AU Headquarters in 2018 and were completely rejected by the AU and the African people including many state leaders. We do not want to see the same farce and laughing stock in Zimbabwe.”
Regarding the new parliament building, which sits on a land area of 33 000 square metres, Local Government technical director of engineering services Henry Hungwe, during a site visit last week, said relevant departments had carried out security checks and nothing unusual was detected.
“We were here from the beginning of site establishment. We included every department responsible. We had all departments in government involved. The road was done by ministry of Transport and Infrastructure Development while water was connected by Zinwa. Zesa did the electricity,” he said.
“… and the checks (were done) by the security people including the police. Security checks were done from the beginning. I can confirm that we asked our security people to have the liberty to do a sweep of the building to check and see if there is anything. But so far everything is on track.”
The imposing new parliament building, whose architectural design was derived from the country’s Great Zimbabwe ruins in Masvingo, has an office building which boasts of 600 rooms. The office building has capacity to accommodate 1 000 people.
It also has an outdoor access road leading to the Public Square and ceremony square in front of the Parliament building with a grand stair case.
Construction of the building started in November 2018 and was completed on May 27 this year. Shanghai Construction Group was contracted to carry out the project.
Beijing and Harare have hailed the new building as a symbol of solid ties between Zimbabwe and China.
The allure of the building is expected to herald a new capital as authorities plan to set up offsite infrastructure such as shopping malls and residential stands to decongest Harare.
It boasts of two sections, which include a six-storey office building and a four-storey parliament building.",1,,,"{'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare', 'Masvingo'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'Shanghai'], 'USA': ['African Union Bethel Church (historical)']}",surveillance,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['CHINA', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) were tipped off about the Chinese national’s attempt to enter the country illegally. Collaboration between ZRP, Qatar Airways, and UK/Northern Ireland passport offices uncovered a network of five individuals with forged Chinese passports and UK residence permits. The individual has been charged under Zimbabwe’s Immigration Act.
One member, Lin Xinwei, had been under surveillance since a previous attempt to use a fake passport. NeoFace Watch aided in confirming Xinwei’s identity using facial recognition to match Xinwei to a previous attempt to board a flight using a fake passport, and allowed authorities to flag her and identify other members of her criminal group.
NEC XON NeoFace Watch is a facial recognition system designed primarily for law enforcement and security applications, capable of rapidly analyzing video feeds and identifying individuals by comparing their faces to extensive databases. The system boasts high accuracy in matching faces even when dealing with challenges like poor image quality, variations in angles, and attempts to disguise appearances.

Zimbabwe,8932,newzimbabwevision.com,2018-01-18T10:34:49Z,"BOND NOTES WILL STAY in circulation, Finance and Economic Planning Minister Patrick Chinamasa, people say ‘NO diaspora votes, no elections, else we become an African sh*thole country ! – newzimbabwevi","BOND NOTES WILL STAY in circulation, Finance and Economic Planning Minister Patrick Chinamasa, people say ‘NO diaspora votes, no elections, else we become an African sh*thole country !
Minister Chinamasa , a man from the same Zanu pf regime under Mugabe which introduced the much hated and worthless bond notes a.k.a ‘toilet paper’ understandably valid only in what US president reportedly referred to as ‘African sh*thole countries’ has declared that bond notes will remain in circulation adding that the government aims to normalise relations with the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United States create ad create an investor friendly environment.
This comes at a time when President Mnangagwa has said also announced that Zimbabweans should brace for harmonised elections in the next five months. MDC T opposition are mired with controversy over the manner of placing an unelected personal choice of Vice, Nelson Chamisa to run MDC T in the run up to elections, while sidelining an elected Ndebele, female president, Dr Thokozani Khuphe and thereby disregarding the party constitution, indirectly creating a personalisation of MDC T party like we experienced with Mugabe and Zanu pf.
Further chaos in opposition is proven by Mavambo/Kusile/Dawn (MKD) leader Simba Makoni beeing dumped by some MKD senior officials who allege that he is a failed politician so they have formed their own party called Democratic Opposition Party (DOP) led by Harry Peter Wilson.
The MKD officials claim that they realised that Simba Makoni is still attached to his former party Zanu PF a fact demonstrated by how the former Finance minister selfishly split votes in the 2008 elections.
Already MDC T and the exiled Professor Jonathan Moyo have raised alarm at the deployment of over 2000 soldiesr across rural areas by Zimbabwe’s new president Emmerson Mnangagwa. They are concerned that we are being set up for a similar violent election to that of 2008.
Mnangagwa recently declared at a meeting with Zimbabweans in Namibia that Zimbabwe will not facilitate diaspora voting, therefore meaning the 6million Zimbabweans in the diaspora and generally anti Mnangagwa, Zanu pf stalwarts and securocrats would have been eliminated from voting. he claimed that if they are serious they can travel to Zimbabwe and register on BVR to vote when election time comes.
This effectively seals the issue, because Mnagagwa’s government through George Charamba, a few days ago when Tsvangirai’s diplomatic passport was reinstated, explained that tsvangirai was stripped of his Zimbabwean passport as no Zimbabwean is allowed to hold more than one passport.
This means that any diaspora Zimbabwean with dual citizenship as has been generally happening, is expected to renounce their Zimbabwean citizenship at port of entry on arrival, obtain a visa to enter Zimbabwe and leave at the end of the visa period.
All these are Mnangagwa, Zanu pf stalwart and securocrat tactics to marginalise the powerful diaspora as they are real game changers because they are a source of wealth and support to the elderly population, unemployed youth and other electorate in Zimbabwe and can influence and change the political dispensation.
Mnangagwa is also on record for having stated at the 17 annual Zanu pf December conference in December 2017 that Zanu pf was planning to start a Zanu pf TV station to cunter what he termed as an increasingly hostile social media.
We all know that Zanu pf has traditionally used the Zanu pf partisan ZBC, Herald and Chronicle to churn out propaganda and brainwash followers but they are by their own admission, losing the war because, we the people rule the independant media circles.
It is clear that Mnangagwa, Zanu pf stalwarts and securocrats have no intention to afford diaspora Zimbabweans, equality with all Zimbabweans in their motherland, yet this is the same regime that forced people out of the country.
We the people have the power. If Mnangagwa, Zanu pf stalwarts and securocrats look down upon diaspora Zimbabweans the way they are doing now, we must ramp up pressure upon this illegitimate regime through the media and use our diaspora connection to step up protests at Zimbabwe’s embassies worldwide, and keep leaders in the global village aware of the injustice faced.
The First world must not rush into funding Mnangagwa government in the name of helping Zimbabwe, particularly Britain as they are our colonial masters and therefore hold key interests in resolving Zimbabwe’s issues. Funding Mnangagwa regime by any government is no different from lengthening the people’s suffering as it leaves the diaspora stuck in the middle of nowhere, though not a crisis issue because they are in societies with respect for the Rule of Law.
We have a right to be respected and the opposition particularly the MDC Alliance has an obligation to use the 6 million diaspora voters as a leverage weapon against Mnangagwa, Zanu pf stalwarts and securocrats by declaring that ‘NO diaspora votes, no elections!
At this point in time we are only proceeding to participate in a clearly fraudulent election, only to legitimise Mnangagwa, Zanu pf stalwarts and securocrats who look down upon diaspora Zimbabweans. If MDC Alliance take that stance, the international world will look closer at the injustices suffered by the people of Zimbabwe through marginalisation of the diaspora Zimbabweans and in the name of peace, democracy, equality and justice, cease any attempts to stabilise or fund an illegitimate regime.
Britain reportedly had the opportunity to save Zimbabwe during Gukurahundi but instead chose to bring Mugabe’s Zvimba cousin the former Air Commander of the AFZ now the minister of Agriculture and lands, Perrance Shiri a.k.a Bigboy Samson Chikerema to a six month course at the Royal Air Force training center in UK, while Ndebeles were being butchered by the Fifth Brigade under his command back in Zimbabwe and so, we the people, particularly those in the western world Uk and the US must ramp up pressure until diaspora votes are accepted otherwise. ‘NO diaspora votes, no elections, else we become an African sh*thole country !
Lest we forget, in March 2008, Zimbabwe experienced a tumultous time, because of unprecedented electoral violence before and post the 29 March 2008 general election.
Mugabe, Mnangagwa, Zanu PF stalwarts and securocrats had lost relevance because of the continued suffering and hunger across Zimbabwe and the people were clearly hungry for a change of power due to economic situation.
General elections were held in Zimbabwe on 29 March 2008 to elect the President and Parliament. Because of Zimbabwe’s dire economic situation, the elections were expected to provide This was certainly a huge challenge for President Robert Mugabe who was yet to face a ballot as tough as the march 2008 election.
Unsurprisingly so, President Robert Mugabe, lost the election as Zimbabwe’s main opposition, MDC T leader Morgan Tsvangirai, clearly won, but Mugabe refused to step down or publish the result and chose to publicly declare that thieves were about to steal the nation.
What most Zimbabweans did not realise at that very moment in time, was that, a Chinese ship (pictured) named, the An Yue Jiang whose ship master reportedly identified as Captain Sunaijun, was on standby in the South African, Durban Port, laden with arms destined for Zimbabwe.
The ship’s deadly consignment of 77-tonnes of weapons included three million rounds of ammunition for AK-47 rifles and small arms, 1,500 rocket-propelled grenades and thousands of mortar rounds, mortar tubes and other military weapons, from Beijing to Harare, leading to South African Port workers refusing to offload the shipment as they knew very well, Mugabe was preparing to massacre Zimbabweans in a bid to stay in power even though he had lost the ballot but was unwilling to announce the result.
At the same time, the South African High Court, played a critical role in delaying a potential massacre of Zimbabweans by declaring that, the deadly ammunition could only be unloaded at port but not be transported by road. This court stance, coupled with the Port workers refusal to offload the weapons, led to the An Yue Jiang, sailing off towards Mozambique in an attempt to offload the weapons there.
With the political stalemate in place, any nation assisting the movement of the weapons to Zimbabwe, would have played a key role in suppressing a people’s defiance to oppressive authority as the cargo, was enough to run a full blown war, yet Mugabe was dealing with unarmed civilians seeking democracy for all
As far as the Chinese government was concerned, they were simply engaging in normal trade with Zimbabwe and all was in order, and they would not or involve themselves in interfere with a sovereign state’s internal affairs as was the case then, or so they claimed.
South African opposition foreign affairs and independant Human rights groups, along with International security, and international media and International pressure groups, tracked the ships movements , also using planes and helicopters, knowing very well that the Chinese government had supported Robert Mugabe by training and arming his guerrillas during the war for independance against the British government in the 70s. , while at the same time they had now reportedly furnished Mugabe’s Zanu PF government with radio-jamming devices to prevent independent stations from disseminating information to the public.
To the ‘Discerning Eye-newzimbabwevision;, China is a stumbling bloc to democracy in Zimbabwe, as, it considers Zimbabwe like an annex because Zimbabwe ‘owes’ its freedom to Chinese benevolence, hence why China has, reportedly , on past occassions vetoed the UN security council from debating Zimbabwe’s crisis arguing that Zimbabwe’s issues were an internal not a public matter.
The An Yue Jiang, having sailed around the Southern coast of Africa and met up with the same defiance all round as different port workers at different countries, refused to offload, what they knew was a looming bloodbath through Mugabe butchering their kith and kin.
Mugabe would have butchered Zimbabweans with the deadly weapons, irrespective of what race, tribe, religion or colour one was in a second wave of his gukurahundi genocide ‘moment of madness’ and that would have included many of those singing for their supper, in favour of Mugabe and his Zanu PF today,…..LITTLE DID THEY KNOW! The ship eventually sailed off back to China, with its consignment, and Zimbabweans received a lifeline but never realised how close they were to being butchered by Mugabe over Zimbabwe.
Zimbabwe’s deposed former President Robert Mugabe’s decison to place ‘Joint Operations Command (Joc)’ A Security grouping which involves the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA), Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP), And Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) on high alert and Mugabe’s cousin the former Home Affairs Minister Ignatius Chombo’s order to the ruthless police to crush any uprising, is yet another indicator that Mugabe, Zim1 family, Zanu PF stalwarts and securocrats are prepared to slaughter Zimbabweans in order to maintain a firm grip on power.",0,,,"{'None': ['Africa'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'GBR': ['United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe', 'Harare'], 'NAM': ['Republic of Namibia'], 'MOZ': ['Republic of Mozambique'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'ZAF': ['Durban']}",diaspora_activation,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']

As such, they needed someone like me,” Chirenda told me, energetically.Now 70 years old, she said her husband immediately divorced her for challenging him in the elections – a bold move for Chirenda, who lacked formal qualifications or resources but held firmly to her convictions and won the vote.For the last decade, she’s represented and fought to support her community, challenging the still widely-ingrained belief that only men can lead. Today, she is one of several women politicians who didn’t make it through parties’ primaries and won’t be standing in this month’s elections (30 July).“The biggest barrier” to gender parity in the country, Chirenda said at a recent Women and Law in Southern Africa (WLSA) Zimbabwe event, “are people at the top who continue to impose their candidates” and “undermine women’s efforts to take up leadership positions.”Jennifer Chirenda at the WLSA Zimbabwe event in Harare. Photo: Sally Nyakanyanga.Movements for gender equality internationally gained new visibility in the mid-1990s when close to 200 countries adopted the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, including Zimbabwe. It commits governments to the goal of gender-balanced government bodies, including through new targets and measures to increase women’s participation also in political parties.Almost 25 years later, equality remains an uphill struggle around the world. According to Zimbabwe’s electoral commission, more registered voters are women. This is not the case for elected representatives, however.Currently there are 88 women in Zimbabwe’s parliament and 182 men. Women hold a higher share (33%) of seats here than in many other countries, but this is thanks to a provision in Zimbabwe’s 2013 constitution which reserves 60 seats for women – and this quota is temporary, expiring in 2023. In local governments, there are only 281 women councillors compared to 1,512 men.This month’s elections may produce an even more gender-imbalanced parliament. There are only 19 women out of 210 candidates of the ruling party Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF). Women are also dramatically underrepresented among opposition candidates.Four women have filed papers as presidential candidates, but it’s still a pipe dream that after this election a woman will lead Zimbabwe.The ousting of the long-serving former president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, through military intervention in November 2017, rekindled the hopes of many for more equal opportunities and gender parity. Many of the people who marched on 18 November to the state house to oust Mugabe were women.Such hopes were quickly dashed by the new administration which has done little to promote parity and appointed only four women to serve in its cabinet.A young woman addresses the president at a meeting last month. Photo: Sally NyakanyangaSection 124 of Zimbabwe’s constitution says that 60 reserved seats for women will last “for the life of the first two parliaments.” But section 17, which does not expire, commits the state more broadly to promoting “full gender balance in Zimbabwean society” including in institutions and agencies “at every level.”“However, women are still lagging behind,” said Dorcas Makaza-Kanyimo, acting national director for WLSA Zimbabwe. “This is despite women organisations coming up with an election women’s manifesto early this year to ensure political parties adhere to the gender parity agenda.”The women’s election manifesto was a brainchild of the Zimbabwe Women Parliamentary Caucus (ZWPC) and women’s organisations across the country. It called for all parties to have 50/50 gender parity in their election candidates, but the small numbers of women running suggest it hasn’t had much impact.Sabhina Mangwende, an outgoing Zanu-PF parliamentarian, emphasised the need for women in parliament to “support each other and continue to promote the empowerment of women.” They should also, she added, “dialogue and educate women from the grassroots on human rights and gender equality.”Susan Matsunga, the opposition candidate for Mufakose (a high-density area in Harare) said that there is also a “lack of empowerment programs” for women who are entering politics and that this has “a negative impact on women’s representation in decision-making.” Such capacity-building support, she added, is needed across the country on an ongoing basis, not only during election time.“Gender parity should begin right from political parties and women leaders on the other side taking the lead to educate and empower their fellow women in their constituencies on the need to demand and claim gender parity in all decision making in the country,” said Makaza-Kanyimo at WLSA Zimbabwe.As the election nears, some women (and men) from both ruling and opposition parties, who were not selected as party candidates, will be contesting seats as independents. Chirenda, in Murewa, is not running.

President Mnangagwa has been commended for strengthening diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia by appointing seasoned diplomat Ambassador Jonathan Wutawunashe to serve as the country’s representative there.
Ambassador Wutawunashe was appointed on the same day another career diplomat Mr Taonga Mushayavanhu became Zimbabwe’s new ambassador to the United Nations in New York while Mrs Abigail Shonhiwa is the new ambassador to China, based in Beijing and Ms Stella Nkomo the new chief envoy to India, stationed in New Delhi.
Under the Second Republic, Zimbabwe’s investment drive is attracting the attention of Saudi Arabia and the latter has indicated its willingness to set up an embassy here as well as incorporating the country in the Saudi Development Fund.
Saudi Arabia’s willingness was expressed by the then Minister of State for African Countries Affairs, Mr Ahmed Kattan during his visit to Zimbabwe in November 2020 when he had the opportunity to meet President Mnangagwa.
With a gross domestic product of more than US$800 billion in 2021, Saudi Arabia is one of the world’s top 20 economies and its interest in doing business in Zimbabwe is a sign Zimbabwe is now dealing with big capital in its quest to attain an upper middle income society by 2030.
Speaking with The Herald recently, Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) president Mr Mike Kamungeremu said businesses were upbeat about engaging Saudi companies.
“It’s an important development to have an embassy in Saudi Arabia which is welcome for business,” said Mr Kamungeremu.
“There is huge capital in Saudi Arabia and as ZNCC, we will definitely work with the new embassy to connect with business people from that country and do business.
“We are also aware of efforts being made by ZimTrade to grow exports to that country and we hope the new embassy will make it much easier for us to get clients from that country and export our products,” said Mr Kamungeremu.
Previously, Saudi Arabia dispatched a high-powered delegation to Zimbabwe to scout opportunities in mining, agriculture, tourism and infrastructural development as well as strengthen diplomatic and trade ties between the two countries.
University of Zimbabwe international affairs lecturer as well as diplomatic and political affairs expert Dr Prolific Mataruse commended Zimbabwe’s foreign policy trajectory.
“Strengthening relations especially economically with Saudi Arabia is an excellent move and I commended the Government of Zimbabwe for that,” said Dr Mataruse.
“Saudi Arabia’s economic outlook is strong. Saudi Arabia is on the road to become one of the world’s strongest economies and it will rank among the top seven economies globally.
“Now that we are pursuing economic diplomacy I think it is wise to expand relations with countries that have strong economies and are willing to invest in Zimbabwe.
“President Mnangagwa has done the responsible thing of pursuing a multi-pronged foreign policy of re-engagement, affirmation and engagement, I commend him for pursuing it and could give him a vigorous policy of economic diplomacy,” said Dr Mataruse.
The new envoy to Saudi Arabia, tasked to lead the country’s economic diplomacy agenda, Ambassador Wutawunashe is a seasoned diplomat and public servant who served in diplomatic missions for over 40 years having joined Government service in 1980, and was among the pioneering group of Zimbabwe’s diplomatic trainees.",1,,,"{'SAU': ['Kingdom of Saudi Arabia'], 'ZWE': ['Republic of Zimbabwe'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'IND': ['Republic of India'], 'USA': ['New York']}",diplomatic_recognition,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Beijing']"

“Some 1.3 billion people now live in China and half of them have seen Walter Defends Sarajevo,” he added. “It is our goal to awaken the young generation with Walter, the same way it awoke us.”
This movie showed the heroic defence of the Bosnian capital in World War II when Josip Tito’s Partizans fought the German occupation forces. Many see the spirit of the film as having represented the city’s determination to resist conquest in more recent times, too.
The spirit of “Walter” is often evoked to describe the will power of Sarajevans to defend themselves in general from any kinds of evil.
Xiang predicted that many Chinese tourists would want to visit Sarajevo once the remake is finished.
The project has been estimated to cost some 3.5 million euro and the actors will be Bosnian while the director will be Chinese.
Adis Bakrac, director of Film Center Sarajevo, said that Bosnian crews will help the Chinese with the filming.
“We expect a start on filming in 2015 and will work on the post-production during 2016,” Bakrac said.
“We insisted on our Center participating in the project with suggestions and in the presentation of the project,” he added.
In the original movie, the German troops try in vain to disable the Sarajevo resistance movement, led by the mysterious Walter.
One of the best-known scenes in the movie is when a German officer and an official from the Gestapo talk, and the army officer concludes they will not find the mysterious Walter.
Instead, he shows the Gestapo man a panorama of Sarajevo and says: “Do you see this city? This is Walter!”

Trump sent a letter to Rama on Friday, thanking his government for its stance on G5 security and inviting Albania him to quit the Chinese-led organization 17+1, which is a platform developed by Beijing to collaborate with Eastern European countries.
“I encourage you to join the United States and other European nations in moving your embassy to Jerusalem,” the Trump letter added.
Rama politely declined. “In our foreign policy we are aligned with the European Union,” he said. “Albania, up till today, since it entered the EU integration processes, remains the only non-member country that has not moved in any case from the line agreed with the European Union in the field of foreign affairs,” he added.

Serbian officials on Tuesday signed agreements with China worth $3 billion during a two-day visit to Beijing, which include Chinese economic investments and the purchase of new military equipment by Belgrade.
“The contracts we signed dramatically change the position of Serbia; we will be the port for Chinese investments throughout the region,” Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said in Beijing.
Vucic, who made the trip to Beijing with several of his ministers, called the agreements “big injections into our economy”.
Serbian state news agency Tanjug reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping said during the meeting with Vucic on Tuesday that Serbia is a “good, honest friend, and good partner”.
“You are sincerely advocating long-term good relations with China, working in the long-term to improve our relations and our cooperation, and I really appreciate that,” Xi said.
The signed agreements include one worth $900 million with the China’s Shandong Linglong Tire Co to build a factory in the northern Serbian city of Zrenjanin, and also with the Chinese company Zijin Mining Group which will, as a strategic partner, invest $1.46 billion in the Serbian RTB-Bor mines over the next six years.
Other agreements are related to infrastructure building, such as the construction of roads and bridges across Serbia, as well as the reconstruction of the country’s railways.
Serbia also signed a deal with the Chinese company CRBC to build an industrial park near Belgrade, which will involve more than 1,000 Chinese companies, it was announced.
“It will be China’s largest industrial park in Europe,” Serbian Economy Minister Sinisa Mali said in a press release on Tuesday.
Serbian media also reported that during Vucic’s visit to China it was agreed that Serbia will buy six military drones from China’s Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, of which two will be armed.
Vucic said Serbia is also negotiating with one Chinese company that is interested in investing in the north of Kosovo.
According to the Serbian Statistical Office, trade between Serbia and China has been growing.
In the period from January-June 2017, there were $29.4 million of Serbian exports to China. This figure grew to $38.1 dollars in the same period this year.
Imports from China grew even more. The total amount was $779.3 million in the first six months of 2017, which rose to $1,026 million in the same period this year.
A report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, published in September 2017, claimed that there are “legitimate concerns” about the Chinese investments because Chinese companies serve as proxies for the Chinese state, and employ few locals, while infrastructure projects and lending agreements burden governments with large debt obligations.
In 2015, a BIRN investigation demonstrated how Energoprojekt Niskogradnja, the company tasked with building a section of the Chinese-funded Belgrade-Montenegro Corridor 11 route, quietly handed a $75 million contract to a consortium of three firms linked to Serbia’s ruling parties and which had little or no road-building experience.
The 2009 inter-state agreement between Serbia and China on the construction of Corridor 11 did not require public oversight or the publication of a tender in the appointment of subcontractors, a clause exploited by Energoprojekt Niskogradnja, according to documents obtained by BIRN.

Serbia’s proposal that China and Serbia abolish visas between the two countries could lead to a boom in tourism to Serbia, former Serbian ambassador to China Slobodan Unkovic said.
“If this proposal passes, combined with the proposal to open Belgrade-Beijing flights and a Belgrade-Shanghai link, it could lead to the major boost in Serbian tourism,” Unkovic told BIRN.
He said the plan would be especially important for tourism since the Chinese spent over 180 billion US dollars on traveling abroad this year.
Serbia announced on Sunday that it would suggest the abolition of visas for stays under 30 days. Attending the Serbian government session, Chinese Ambassador Li Manchang said he was convinced that the government in Beijing would agree to the proposal.
“This plan is in accordance with the continuity of the good relationship between Serbia and China and with the documents signed during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in mid-June,” said Unkovic.
During the three-day June visit of the Chinese delegation to Serbia, led by President Jinping, the two countries signed 22 agreements on business relations designed to boost Serbia’s weak economy.
Nikola Jovanovic, of the Belgrade-based Center for International Relations and Sustainable Development, CIRSD, said that if the proposal is accepted, it could boost commercial exchanges as well as tourism.
“Serbia could become an important junction for China’s investments in Southeast Europe. Potentially, this is good news for Serbia but we have to see if Serbia fits into China’s global investment project,” he told BIRN.
Jovanovic said he hoped the planned abolition of visas would be realized, as it would be another milestone in the developing relationship between two countries.
“This would be the continuation of the policy between Serbia and China that started in 2009 with the signing of the Agreement on the Strategic Collaboration,” he said.
He recalled that China was eager to invest in the port of Thessaloniki in Greece, from which its goods could travel via Serbia to the rest of the Europe.
The “New Silk Road,” officially known as the “One Belt, One Road”, project, is a key part of China’s foreign policy. It aims to give Beijing greater international influence and expand its trade opportunities by reviving the ancient Silk Road as a modern transport, trade and economic corridor from Shanghai to Berlin.
The 13,000-kilometre route from China via Russia, Belarus, and Poland would create an economic zone and implies the construction of high-speed railways, roads, energy hubs and a fiber optic cable network.
The route is part of China’s 16+1 initiative, launched in 2012. The initiative seeks to improve trade and economic ties with 16 countries in Central and Eastern Europe: Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia.
The Tourist Organization of Serbia, TOS, has high expectations of the abolition of visas with China, marketing manager Aneta Uskokovic said.
She told BIRN that tourist numbers from China are rising fast and almost doubled in the last four years.
“If Serbia became the first country in Europe to mutually abolish visas with China, it will be a major boost to tourism from that country. We have been active in that market since 2012 and have seen a constant rise in visits,” she said.
A breakthrough project between Serbia and China was the construction in 2010 of a bridge near the capital, Belgrade. This was soon followed by the first phase of renovations at the thermal power plant in the northeastern town of Kostolac.

Serbia,295,balkaninsight.com,2014-12-18T16:58:15Z,Serbia Expels Arrested Falun Gong Members,"Fulan Gong movement is also known as Fulan Dafa. | Photo by Longtrekhome/Flickr
Dejan Markovic, an activist of Falun Gong, told Radio Free Europe that 11 members of the movement were expelled from Serbia on Wednesday after police arrested them on December 14.
Falun Gong members had previously tried to get the approval of the Belgrade police to stage peaceful protests on December 15 and 16, ahead of a two-day summit with China’s Prime Minister, to “increase awareness of the state of human rights in China”.
The Serbian police banned the protests without explanation. Police then arrested 11 members of Falun Gong, including nine Bulgarian nationals, one Slovak and one Finnish national of Chinese origin.
“They were all asked to sign a statement acknowledging that they came to Belgrade to take part in a banned gathering. If they refused, they would be deported and blacklisted. They refused to sign the statement, so they were kept in custody,” Markovic told Radio Free Europe on December 18.
“Serbia probably got a black list from China, so some of the activists were stopped and returned from the border,” Markovic added.
He said the group was deported from Serbia after their embassies and the European Parliament called for their release.
Eduard Kukan, chair of the EU-Serbia Stabilisation and Association Parliamentary Committee, on Wednesday said the European Parliament supported democracy and the right to assembly and peaceful protest in the EU and in countries aspiring to join the EU.
“Considering that Serbia is an EU candidate country, we are alarmed by the steps the Serbian authorities took in this case, and we ask for release of the human rights activists, as well as a clear explanation of the situation,” Kukan wrote in a statement.
The rights watchdog Amnesty International also urged Serbia to release the arrested Falun Gong activists, calling the arrests “illegal”.
Serbia’s opposition New Party described the arrests as a “great embarrassment” for the country.
Markovic said the activists only came to Serbia to visit non-governmental organisations and embassies and draw attention to the problems of human rights in China.
The movement started in China in the early 1990s and has long fallen foul of the authorities there. Falun Gong, which literally means “Dharma Wheel Practice”, is spiritual discipline for mind and body, combining meditation and “qiqong” exercises with a philosophy emphasising morality and the cultivation of virtue.
However, the Chinese authorities often describe Falun Gong as an “evil cult”, accusing the group of promoting illegal activities, promoting superstition and disrupting social order.
Falun Gong was banned in China after 10,000 practitioners staged a protest outside the government compound in Beijing in 1999.
Falun Gong claim the Chinese government has killed more than 3,000 of its activists and jailed tens of thousands in a crackdown on the movement in the last decade.",1,,,"{'SRB': ['Serbia', 'Belgrade'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing']}",diplomatic_sanction,['Beijing'],[],[],"['China', 'Chinese']"

Huawei’s Innovations and Development Centre was opened on Monday in the presence of Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic and the Chinese ambassador to Belgrade, just a week after Serbia signed a controversial agreement in Washington which appeared to target Chinese involvement in the development of 5G in Serbia.
Brnabic said the centre will significantly help further digitalisation in Serbia and that despite the Washington agreement, the country was working on many other technologies with Huawei that are a precondition for the introduction of 5G.
“Many things are being prepared with Huawei, which will only be visible in the next few months or a year,” Brnabic said.
She insisted that cooperation with Huawei on the introduction of 5G network in Serbia is does not contravene the agreement signed in Washington.
“Serbia is not interested in unreliable technologies either, on the contrary, it is in the interest of the tender for the introduction of the 5G network to be open and transparent, while respecting international standards, which includes the agreement from Washington,” she said.
Li Mengqun, president of Huawei Western Balkans, told media that he expects cooperation with the Serbian government to increase.
“We hope and believe that the Serbian government will continue to create an open and fair business environment for ICT [information and communications technology] infrastructure construction. Together, we can make Serbia a world leader in the digital era with ubiquitous connectivity, digital platforms, and pervasive intelligence,” Li said.
The agreement signed by President Aleksandar Vucic and separately by Kosovo’s Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti at the White House last week in the presence of Donald Trump, committed Serbia and Kosovo not to use equipment supplied by “untrusted vendors” in their telecommunications networks.
No firms were named, but the Trump administration has been campaigning internationally to roll back China and Huawei’s role in telecommunications in Europe.
The ninth point of the agreement said: “Both parties will prohibit the use of 5G equipment in their mobile communication networks, which is delivered by an unverified seller. Where such equipment is already present, both parties will commit to its removal and other efforts at mediation to do so in a timely manner.”
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the public auction for the 5G spectrum in Serbia has been postponed for the first quarter of 2021.
However, Huawei has had a presence in Serbia for a long time, increasing its participation in big projects in the last couple of years.
The company has a 150 million euro contract with state-owned Telekom Srbija for the procurement of equipment, services and works for landline network modernisation and has also been named as a partner in developing the 5G network with privately-owned Telenor.
Huawei and the Serbian interior ministry also have a partnership agreement for the introduction of Huawei’s ‘eLTE’ wireless broadband technologies and ‘Smart City’ public security systems including a large-scale surveillance network that is to be installed in Serbia’s capital.
The interior ministry has told Radio Free Europe that details of the agreement are secret, however.
The Ministry of Tourism, Trade and Telecommunications signed a memorandum of understanding with Huawei for the ‘Smart City’ project in 2019, and a strategic partnership agreement for development of the broadband network in Serbia in 2017.
It has said that the White House agreement has no effect on such cooperation.
Combined with other Chinese investment projects under way or in the pipeline, some experts have suggested that Serbia has emerged as the most important country in the Balkans for China’s Belt and Road Initiative.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'SRB': ['Serbia', 'Belgrade'], 'XKX': ['Republic of Kosovo'], 'USA': ['Washington', 'White House'], 'None': ['Balkan Peninsula']}",tech_transfer_investment,"['China', 'Huawei']","['China', 'Huawei']","['China', 'Huawei']","['Huawei', 'China', 'Chinese']"

Serbia,4307,balkaninsight.com,2021-12-28T12:43:18Z,Serbia’s Personal Data Commissioner: Huawei Cameras a ‘Dangerous’ Decision,"As a country with a reputation for so-called “trapped institutions”, where politics heavily influences the work of civil servants, heading an independent body in Serbia can be a struggle.
Milan Marinovic has for two years been Serbia’s Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection, a sector in which there is a lot of work to do, due mainly to the way state institutions routinely refuse to answer media inquiries, so generating complaints to Marinovic’s office.
However, his job could soon be even more challenging having in mind the government’s plan to officially install thousands of facial recognition cameras made by Chinese tech giant Huawei during 2022.
The introduction of a planned 8,100 Huawei cameras in the capital, Belgrade, but also other cities, conducted by the Interior Ministry, has concerned many civil rights and cybersecurity experts.
This highly invasive technology is officially banned in the EU and critics fear its real aim is to target opponents of the government, both in opposition, but also activists and journalists.
“The introduction of such technology is obviously a political decision. The Commissioner's role is to point out the dangers of introducing such technology for human rights,” Marinovic told BIRN.",1,,,"{'SRB': ['Serbia', 'Belgrade'], 'FRA': ['Eu']}",surveillance,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei']
Serbia,5465,balkaninsight.com,2023-06-22T05:34:03Z,Social Controls: China-Style Surveillance is Coming to Serbia,"Under the rule of the Serbian Progressive Party, Serbia has introduced cutting-edge technology to keep watch on citizens and political rivals. China-style smart cameras (and base stations) spring up after every protest in Serbia. The President and Prime Minister could use recent shootings and social protests against violence to advance problematic laws and policies aimed at control, rather than security.
The most controversial measure is the Bill aimed at legalizing biometric surveillance in Serbia. The idea of legalizing biometric surveillance to “counter terrorism and organized crime” was (re)introduced in 2021 after ecological protests and roadblocks against lithium mining – the Rio Tinto project.
When the Bill, which the Ministry of Interior drafted almost in secrecy, became known to the public, massive dissatisfaction with the introduction of biometric surveillance, among other things, forced the Ministry to withdraw the proposal. Aleksandar Vulin, the then Interior Minister, called opponents of the Bill mercenaries of “a few foreign intelligence services” who want to “stage violent rallies with the aim of destabilizing Serbia”.
Soon after the withdrawal of the Bill, information leaked out that the Serbian and the Russian Ministries of Interior had created a “working group for countering coloured revolutions” [referencing the so-called ‘orange’ 2004 revolution in Ukraine, among others] and that the Serbian police were seeking special training on cybersecurity from Russia – steps that caused concern among civil society.
In the present-day political context, the introduction of a mass biometric surveillance system in Serbia remains the greatest threat to privacy and data protection, but it also has a deterrent effect on freedom of assembly and association, as well as freedom of expression.
Police authorities deny that smart cameras record people and process biometric data, but the evidence suggests otherwise. In 2019, Nebojša Stefanović, the then Interior Minister, used photos from surveillance cameras to intimidate the protesters and deter them from further rallies. Two years later, thousands of Serbian citizens received court fines for roadblocks during the ecological protests, even though they had not been identified by the traffic police.
To calm down the situation, the Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Protection of Personal Data launched an investigation. This concluded that the police had not used facial recognition technology during the rallies, but that persons had been identified “based on the immediate observation of police officers in line with the Misdemeanour Law”. Unlike people from urban areas, who are more resilient to state oppression, people from smaller communities felt bewildered and frightened, which could impact the number of activists involved in future protests.
Permanent, non-selective, China-style, surveillance is unacceptable in a society that aspires to become democratic and a member of the European Union. This is why civil society in Serbia is united in urging the government to declare a moratorium on the use of mass biometric surveillance technologies and systems.
Public pressure has raised the bar for introduction of advanced technology, but that hasn’t stopped the police from acquiring Swedish Griffeye face recognition software and restarting public consultations to fine-tune the new Internal Affairs Act. Cybersecurity experts highlight that “the alarming number of intrusive software and big data tools require transparent regulation of such systems to ensure the protection of fundamental human rights”.

Media and telecoms tycoon Bogoljub Karic has joined the campaign supporting the presidential bid of Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia’s Prime Minister and head of the ruling Progressive Party.
“Serbia has it’s own Putin, and it is Aleksandar Vucic! Thanks to our winner, we have all doors open, from Washington to Beijing and Moscow,” Karic told a rally on March 11 staged by the Progressive Party in the western town of Cacak.
Karic returned to Serbia from Russia in December 2016 after years of self-imposed exile, as the fraud investigation against him was halted a few days earlier.
A former media and telecommunications mogul, Karic fled the country in 2006 when prosecutors started to investigate allegedly fraudulent activities connected to his company, Mobtel.
The investigation into Karic was originally launched over suspicions that in 1994, while setting up his mobile operator Mobtel, he reported fake investments in the company through which he benefited to the tune of $21 million.
According to new findings however, Karic incurred additional costs that accounted for the outstanding amount.
Vucic was reportedly annoyed that the case against Karic was being dropped. The Belgrade newspaper Blic described a “storm in the government building” after the Minister of Justice, Nela Kuburovic, and Prime Minister Vucic met to discuss this issue.
“Vucic raised his voice to Kuburovic in dissatisfaction with the Karic case, asking the Minister to explain how Karic could be free man now,” wrote Blic.
“Is it possible that there is no evidence?” Vucic asked, according to Blic.
Minister Kuburovic reportedly defended herself, arguing that she could not influence the prosecutor’s decisions.
Years ago, before the Progressive Party was in government, when Vucic was still a member of the Serbian Radical Party, he called Karic a “thief”.
“I think they [Karić and his brothers] earned their money illegally,” Vucic told Witness newspaper on February 14 2006.
Despite that, the Progressives and Karic’s party Strength of Serbia became partners at the end of 2010, and are still in coalition in parliament.
Karic joined Vucic at a presidential campaign rally on March 4 in Krusevac, in central Serbia.
“Vucic is the biggest maker of reforms in Serbia, after others took 30 years to bring Serbia to its knees till it was destroyed. The last three years have been a turning point in policy so everyone in the region can envy us,” Karic said in Krusevac.
He added that Serbia has not had such a respected politician since the long reign of Yugoslav strongman Josip Broz Tito.
Meanwhile Vucic has repaid the compliment. In Minsk, Belarus, he was there for the opening of Karic’s new shopping mall in January, according to a photo Karic posted on Facebook.
Besides appearing at Vucic’s rally, Karic has been invited to speak at a panel in the Law Faculty at the University of Nis in southern Serbia on March 14 about his success in telecommunications business.
Students were split over this idea, however, and panel was delayed until after the presidential elections are over.",0,,,"{'SRB': ['Serbia', 'Belgrade', 'Kruševac'], 'RUS': ['Russian Federation', 'Moscow'], 'BLR': ['Republic of Belarus', 'Minsk'], 'USA': ['Washington'], 'CHN': ['Beijing']}",political_process_policy_intervention,"['Moscow', 'Beijing']",['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing']

Philippines,674,inquirer.net,2012-05-04T19:03:56Z,"Asean integration to create new ‘growth force’, says ADB economist","MANILA, Philippines – The Southeast Asian region, with an estimated population of 600 million, can join the ranks of China and India as a major economic growth force in Asia should its constituent countries succeed in integrating their economies by 2015.
If the integration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations is implemented as planned, trading of goods, inter-country investments, and labor mobility within the region will become much easier, said Changyong Rhee, chief economist of the Asian Development Bank.
ADVERTISEMENT
This will significantly reduce the cost of production for businesses and economic growth of member-countries and of the entire region will accelerate, said the ADB’s top economist.
With this favorable scenario, Southeast Asia will become more attractive to investors and thus corner more direct investments from multinational companies from outside the region, he said.
“A new growth force is coming in Asia,” Rhee told a press conference on the sidelines of the 45th annual meeting of the ADB board of governors that is being hosted this year by the Philippines.
The 10 countries of Southeast Asia, which together make up the geo-political and economic organization called Asean, are Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Brunei, Burma (Myanmar) and the Philippines.
Asean – established on Aug. 8, 1967 in Bangkok, by the five founding members composed of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand — aims at achieving full economic integration by 2015, creating a single market and production base that will allow the free flow of goods, services, investment, capital and labor throughout the region.
Under the Asean integration plan, tariffs on most goods coming from member-countries will be brought down to zero or near-zero, their financial systems will be integrated, and employment restrictions will be eased so that Southeast Asians would find it easy to find jobs in any country within the region.
Once Asean integration is completed, the region will be able to corner more foreign direct investments, which now mostly go to China and India, said Rhee.
China and India are currently leading growth in Asia and the world, with gross domestic products expanding between 8 and 10 percent over the past few years. Southeast Asian countries are also exhibiting decent growth rates, but at a slower pace.
With integration, growth rates of Southeast Asian countries would be expected to be faster, initially inching closer to and eventually matching those of China and India.
ADVERTISEMENT
Some economists and social science experts, however, believe that Asean integration could be derailed if the ongoing conflicts among some Asean members with China over ownership of territories on the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea) are not resolved soon.
Asean members Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines are claiming ownership in whole or in part of the resource-rich Spratly archipelago, which is also claimed by China and Taiwan.
China and the Philippines are currently facing off at the Panatag island (Scarborough Shoal), which the Philippines says is not in the disputed Spratlys but is well within its 200-mile economic zone, but which China also claims for its own.
Yu Yongding, a professor from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and one of the Chinese delegates to the ADB event, said it would be difficult to implement Asean integration if the geopolitical conflict is left unresolved.
Economic Planning Secretary Cayetano Paderanga Jr. agreed with Yu, although he expressed optimism that Asian policymakers will be able to resolve the conflict soon.
3 characteristics of growth
While Asia remains a potential global growth driver, ADB president Haruhiko Kuroda said Asian countries have expand their goal from merely sustaining healthy economic growth rates to having an economic growth that is “inclusive,” “green” and “knowledge-based.”
Growth must be inclusive, meaning it should benefit not only the middle class and the rich but also the poor, Kuroda said.
Kuroda noted that while many Asian countries have been experiencing decent growth rates, their expanding economies have so far failed to significantly bring down poverty levels.
In the case of the Philippines, for instance, the country has managed to continually grow despite the global economic crisis, but its poverty incidence remains high, at 26.5 percent as of end-2009.
“There are still hundreds of millions of Asians living on $1.25 a day,” Kuroda said in remarks at the opening session of the ADB governors’ meeting.
Some of the proposals raised to reduce poverty include heavier investments in public education and more lending to micro enterprises.
Kuroda said economic growth must be “green,” that is, the rise in incomes must not come at the expense of environmental degradation. Economic growth will not be sustainable if environmental conditions continue to deteriorate, he said.
Lastly, growth must be knowledge-based, meaning enterprises must invest in research and development and in technology to help accelerate the growth of production, Kuroda said.
He echoed statements made by other economists at the meeting that more extensive use of technology was necessary for emerging Asian economies like the Philippines to escape the middle-income trap and graduate to becoming an advanced economy.

President Rodrigo Duterte delivers a televised address on May 5, 2021 (RTVM Screenshot)
In his televised public address late Wednesday night, the Chief Executive said he ordered the withdrawal of some 1,000 jabs of Sinopharm vaccine from the Philippines.
Duterte apologized for getting the shot, the proof of which was uploaded by the Palace on Monday, May 3.
“Well, it’s the decision of my doctor. Anyway, it is my life,” he said, adding that his doctors recommended Sinopharm because of its “record” overseas.
The President earlier said he wanted himself and his family to be inoculated with Sinopharm vaccine, which is reportedly the same one used on Chinese officials, as well as in Brazil and Indonesia.
Duterte clarified that he did not break any law when he got the vaccine despite the lack of an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA.
He insisted that it falls under the compassionate use permit the FDA granted to the President Security Group (PSG) last February when they had themselves inoculated with the vaccine purportedly for his protection.
“Alam ko naman (I know) compassionate use so there was this legal point that made it possible for me to (have it),” Duterte said.
It was Health Secretary Francisco Duque III himself who administered the vaccine to the President.
Palace officials insisted that they did not bring the vaccine illegally into the country because it is part of the donation of the Chinese government.
The vaccine, developed by Beijing Biological Products Institute under state-owned China National Biotec Group (CNBG), is said to be 79.34 percent effective. There are questions about its late trials, though, as well as several severe side effects associated with the vaccine.
Duterte said the public will just have to wait for Sinovac, another Chinese-made vaccine that has been rolled out nationwide since the first batch arrived in early March.",1,,,"{'BRA': ['Federative Republic of Brazil'], 'PHL': ['Manila']}",-999,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing']

Philippines,1707,inquirer.net,2012-11-30T05:34:59Z,Enrile: Cigarette smuggling ongoing,"MANILA, Philippines—Are smuggled cigarettes flooding the Philippine market in anticipation of the sharp increase in tobacco and alcohol taxes?
Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile thinks so after he was handed Thursday morning a pack of China-made cigarettes by a friend who had bought it for P20 in Divisoria.
ADVERTISEMENT
Enrile brandished the pack of “Yunyan” at the Kapihan sa Senado media forum where he was the guest.
“These cigarettes smell real good. They might just get me to start smoking again,” Enrile joked.
Turning serious, the senate president said that even if a unitary tax of P26 were imposed on that brand under the Senate version of the so-called sin tax bill, a pack of Yunyan would still cost only P46—much lower than lowest-priced local cigarette brands.
Enrile and the other senators who were initially against raising sin taxes warned that the measure, once it became law, could trigger cigarette smuggling to meet local demand.
Acting Senate ways and means chairman Franklin Drilon, however, dismissed his colleagues’ concern, saying that smuggling was an issue of law enforcement, not of taxation.
But Enrile countered that the pack of Yunyan indicated that the scenario he and Senators Ralph Recto and Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had feared was already happening.
Enrile said he had information cigarette smuggling was now rampant in Mindanao.
“But smokers don’t have to go that far. Why, Yunyan is already in Manila,” he noted.
Enrile chided Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima and Revenue Commissioner Kim Henares over the Yunyan cigarettes.
ADVERTISEMENT
“If you guys do not know of any local manufacturer that makes this,” he said, holding up the maroon cigarette pack before television cameras, “then where did this come from? Did it swim, or is there a secret manufacturer that Kim Henares does not know of?”
“How did this pack of cigarettes get past customs inspectors in Aduana (in the Port Area)? Who let these in? Who are the smart guys or smart girls with connections,” Enrile said.
“Secretary Purisima, Commissioner Kim Henares, why is there Yunyan in the Philippines?” he pressed.
He reiterated his position that higher sin taxes would trigger smuggling, which in turn would hurt local cigarette manufactu-rers and tobacco industry workers.
Enrile, Recto and Marcos, however, still voted in favor of the sin tax bill.
This after the Senate President was assured the burden-sharing ratio of 60-40 between tobacco and alcohol manufacturers would be observed in its implementation. This means that 60 percent of the new taxes would come from tobacco products while 40 percent would come from alcoholic beverages.
The Senate and the House of Representatives have scheduled a bicameral conference to reconcile their respective versions of the sin tax bill on December 5.

Philippines,32432,inquirer.net,2021-05-31T12:35:39Z,"Agitation on WPS may cause economic backlash to PH, says Rep. Torres-Gomez","MANILA, Philippines — Leyte 4th District Rep. Lucy Torres-Gomez on Monday urged for sobriety in public discussions over the West Philippine Sea (WPS) as she raised economic concerns over calls for the government to be more aggressive in dealing with Chinese military vessels that have been spotted in various reefs inside the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
Torres-Gomez said that while it is easy for the public to focus on its aggressive activities in the WPS, the people should at the same time look at the broader picture if the country continues to agitate, and even anger, China.
ADVERTISEMENT
“There are economic repercussions if we continue to insist that China give in to our demand for them to get off our waters. Let us not forget that China is the Philippines’ biggest export and import partner,” she said, as she noted that in March 2021 alone, the Philippines exported $1.8 billion and imported $1.2 billion to and from China.
“Our economic ties are both our strength and vulnerability. We are not even talking about loans or vaccines,” she added.
She likewise recalled that in 2012, amid the stand-off in the Scarborough Shoal, the country experienced China’s economic backlash when it refused banana exports from the Philippines. The move resulted in the loss of $34 million in revenues, which badly hurt the agriculture sector, particularly banana farmers and plantation workers.
“If in the distant likelihood that we succeed in driving away China’s military vessels out of our EEZ and the WPS, are we prepared to face the economic counterattack that China is likely to use to get back at us? Is our economy ready for the backlash, especially amid the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our fiscal standing?” Torres-Gomez asked.
“The WPS is more complex than just presenting a legal award from an international body. The question is: How much more aggressive must our government be? In this David vs. Goliath situation, things are far from simplistic. For those who are quick to say that aggression is not necessarily an invitation to war, the truth is China does not have to fire a single shot to hurt us,” the representative from Ormoc City said.
The lawmaker suggested that the government appeal for status quo in the region. “Let us appeal to China and our neighbor countries to stand down and momentarily set aside our respective claims on the WPS. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to batter all of us. Let us give each other the space and time to address the global health crisis first. Let us give each other time to heal,” Torres-Gomez said.
She, however, quickly added that the government should not be complacent. “While I am saying that we should be cautious about pursuing our aggressive position on the WPS issue, I am at the same time encouraging the government to continue guarding our sovereign rights. Let us improve how we patrol our seas by modernizing the Philippine Coast Guards, and perhaps we can better assist our fishermen in our EEZ.” she said.

The gunmen have communicated with the family of Gao Huayuan, 29, whom security forces believe is being held in Jolo, Mohammad Mentek, eastern Sabah security command director-general, told AFP.

“They have made telephone contact with her family,” he said.

The Abu Sayyaf, a small band of militants infamous for kidnapping for ransom, are the prime suspects in Wednesday’s abductions of the Chinese tourist and a Filipino resort worker, Marcy Dayawan, 40.

Mohammad said Malaysian authorities believe the two hostages were safe.

“We hope they will be returned safely to their families as soon as possible,” he said.

 
 Mohammad declined to comment whether the kidnappers had began ransom negotiations with the Chinese family.

Philippine authorities believe the kidnappers are affiliated with Abu Sayyaf “sub-commander” Murphy Ambang Ladjia, who was involved in a spectacular kidnapping of 21 people from another Sabah resort in 2000.

That could help seamen in distress, it can help everybody.”Sen. Francis Pangilinan, however, accused Panelo of being a “Chinese puppet.”“Secretary Panelo strikes again. Recently, he was quoted as saying that we should thank China for setting up a maritime rescue center in the Philippines’ Kagitingan Reef,” Pangilinan said.Pangilinan noted that Panelo earlier said that it was alright for the Chinese to fish in the Spratlys and that the palace spokesman called the decision of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that validated the Philippines’ claims on the disputed territories in the West Philippine Sea as “useless as there is no country or body on earth that can enforce” it against China.“One should wonder sometimes which country he was speaking for. His every tone clearly manifests the language of a Chinese puppet,” Pangilinan, a member of the Senate minority bloc, said.Supreme Court Justice Antonio Carpio on Thursday urged the government to protest China’s move “because Fiery Cross Reef is part of the geological features we claim in the Kalayaan island group.”“If we do not protest, then we impliedly consent to China’s act of putting up a maritime rescue center there.

Cagayan de Oro City Rep. Rufus Rodriguez said the proposed ban is contained in House Bill 2465, which he has filed. The measure is pending with the House committee on foreign affairs.
He said the House had approved the measure in the last Congress but the Senate failed to pass it.
“I have refiled my bill and I urge Congress to approve it. No Chinese or any vessel should be allowed in our waters without our approval unless for innocent passage in the designated archipelagic sea lanes,” Rodriguez said.
HB 2464 is titled, “An Act establishing the archipelagic sea lanes in the Philippine archipelagic waters, prescribing the rights and obligations of foreign ships and aircraft exercising the right of archipelagic sea lane passage.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Rodriguez said the proposed law would “penalize arbitrary passage by Chinese and other foreign ships and planes in our archipelagic waters and the adjacent territorial waters.
The bill sets the coordinates designating the sea lanes and air routes for the continuous and expeditious sailing or flight of foreign ships and aircraft exercising the right of innocent passage.
The vessels or planes shall not deviate more than 25 nautical miles from the designated passage routes. They shall not make any activity other than transiting expeditiously.
They shall not make any threat against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of the Philippines.
Transiting ships and planes shall be prohibited from conducting any oceanography or hydrographic survey or research activity unless permitted by the Philippine government.
The proposed law authorizes the President to issue rules and regulations relating to the management and security of the country’s archipelagic and adjacent waters.
The bill imposes the penalty of imprisonment for at least six months and one day to two years and two months, or a fine of $1.2 million, or both upon the discretion of the court, on the ship master or captain of the plane or owner or operators of the vessel or plane.
If the owner is a corporation or a business entity, the penalty shall be imposed on its president.

Philippines,26248,mb.com.ph,2020-03-21T00:00:00Z,"PH receives 100,000 COVID-19 test kits from China; OVP donates more PPEs","By Vanne Elaine Terrazola and Raymund Antonio
The Philippines received on Saturday 100,000 fast-test kits to detect the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and other medical supplies donated by China to support the country’s efforts to stem further spread of the dreaded disease.
Chinese Ambassador to Manila Huang Xi Lian turned over to Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. and other Filipino officials the Chinese government’s donation in aid of the government’s efforts against the pandemic.
Apart from the 100,000 virus test kits, China also donated 100,000 surgical masks, 10,000 N95 masks, and 10,000 sets of personal protective equipment (PPE).
In a statement, Huang said, “China will always remember the valuable support rendered by the Philippine government and people earlier to our fight against the epidemic.”
“Now, the Philippines is facing a severe epidemic situation, the Chinese side feels keenly for the Philippine people,” he added. “China will do its utmost to help the
Philippines overcome the current challenge.”
Last March 16, the Chinese embassy donated 2,000 coronavirus test kits.
“We hope these materials could lend a helping hand to the fight of the Philippine government and people against the epidemic,” Huang said.
Locsin, meanwhile, thanked China for its “tremendous help” to the Philippines.
“It is a model the rest of the world should be doing. Instead of blaming each other of what’s happening, they should all start working together to help each other. And this is concrete proof,” he said in an interview following the turnover at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.
“This is how we tackle a common threat to humanity. Together we help each other as best we can,” he added.
The Department of Health (DOH) said more testing kits from various countries are expected to arrive in the Philippines as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continues to rise.
The DOH said it is anticipating additional 120,500 test kits from South Korea, Brunei, and China. This is in addition to the 1,300 available test kits at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
With this development, the DOH said that it is “accelerating its COVID19 testing capacity.”
The DOH also reported that two additional laboratories are being set up to help in COVID-19 testing.
“Western Visayas Medical Center and Bicol Public Health Laboratory will undergo proficiency testing for one week before it can begin testing,” the DOH said.
With the availability of more testing kits, five private hospitals will also be undergoing assessment to be able to conduct COVID-19 tests.
“The DOH will be assisted by the World Health Organization and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine to assess five more molecular biology laboratories in private tertiary hospitals as possible extension labs starting March 21,” the DOH noted.
The five private hospitals are St. Luke’s Medical Center-Global City, Makati Medical Center, The Medical City, St. Luke’s Medical CenterQuezon City, and the Chinese General Hospital.
“We must underscore the importance of laboratory certification due to the hazards of handling a live virus. The Department is exercising utmost care in certifying more subnational laboratories and ensuring that biosafety measures are in place,” said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.
The University of the PhilippinesNational Institutes of Health was earlier mobilized as an extension laboratory and is “currently testing overflow samples” from the RITM.
The DOH recently announced that other subnational laboratories are now processing COVID-19 testings. These are San Lazaro Hospital, Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center, and Southern Philippines Medical Center.
Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration has approved eight testing kits from South Korea, China, and Germany for commercial use. “Hospitals with laboratory capability can already procure and use [them],” the DOH said.
The DOH said that it may change its testing protocols once it increases its testing capacity.
As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, the Office of the Vice President (OVP) is expanding the distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers from Metro Manila to neighboring provinces.
On the fourth day of the Luzonwide enhanced community quarantine, Vice President Leni Robredo’s office distributed PPE sets to Batangas Provincial Hospital in Lemery, Batangas and Ospital ng Capas in Capas, Tarlac.
This was on top of the 10 Manilabased hospitals that received the latest batch of PPEs from the OVP.
Robredo said her office was able to deliver a total of 15,000 PPE sets for the health workers who are on the frontlines of preventing the spread of COVID-19.
“Patuloy ang pamimigay ng OVP ng mga personal protective equipment (PPE) sa ating mga frontliners laban sa #COVID19! (The OVP continues to distribute PPEs for our frontliners against #COVID19!)” she said in a Facebook post.
Robredo thanked logistics companies such as Transportify, Ninjavan, RAF Forwarding, and the foundation of LBC Express, Inc. that delivered the PPE sets to the hospitals.
Medical professionals and health workers have been working tirelessly to contain the novel coronavirus outbreak.
But the shortage of PPEs that will protect them from the deadly virus has put their lives at risk.
Robredo’s office also donated P5.3 million worth of extraction kits that will be used for 12,750 coronavirus tests at RITM.
“We know how testing is crucial in this time of COVID-19. Massive testing was South Korea’s best practice and they have one of the lowest mortality rates. When we asked RITM how we can help with the testing, they said they need extraction kits,” Robredo said in a separate post.
Washable face masks Meanwhile, supply of face masks got a boost after more than 17,000 washable and reusable face masks were produced by Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) training institutions. These will be distributed to COVID-19 frontliners.
TESDA Secretary Isidro Lapeña issued a memorandum last March 16, encouraging the agency’s training institutions which have registered programs in Dressmaking NC II to immediately start producing and distributing the face masks.
According to Lapeña, the TESDA face masks are made of cotton or any suitable material which are washable and reusable.
Expedite test kit processing
As this developed, Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, called on the RITM and the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) to expedite the processing of the COVID-19 test kits.
“It is very important for now to know who is positive with the coronavirus disease in the country in order to prevent the spread of this disease. This is the reason why it is important for the RITM to act fast in validating the test kits, and the FDA in processing and the approval of the correct and accurate test kits to be used by our hospitals),” he said Go.
“We are avoiding the use of unreliable test kits because of the possibility that this will give false negative result wherein a person positive with the COVID-19 will be declared negative based on the wrong result of the test kits,” he added.
“This is the reason the RITM and FDA are meticulously checking all the test kits coming from other countries, as well as the test kits invented in the country. This is in accordance with our existing laws, and the need to ensure that we are making the right and correct response to this crisis,” he explained.
Go pointed out that ensuring that the test kits we are using are accurate is as important as having ample supply of those test kits. (With reports from Dhel Nazario and Mario B.

Philippines,11410,inquirer.net,2017-01-11T00:07:57Z,"Exports down, imports up in November","Even as exports dropped in November last year, imports sustained robust growth alongside strong manufacturing activity, the government reported Tuesday.
This year, merchandise exports are projected to recover given an expected boost from the pivot to China and Russia, which are being eyed as major destinations for Philippine agricultural produce and manufactured crafts, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto M. Pernia told reporters on the sidelines of a Philippine Statistics Authority forum.

The latest PSA data showed that exports in November dropped 7.5 percent to $4.732 billion from $5.118 billion a year ago, such that end-November exports declined by 5.2 percent to $51.361 billion from $54.168 billion in 2015.
The drop in merchandise exports in November reversed two straight months of year-on-year growth, PSA data showed. Pernia conceded that exports might drop in 2016, although narrower than the end-November decline amid expectations that shipments would have increased in December amid the holidays.
Imports, meanwhile, jumped 19.7 percent in November to $7.298 billion from $6.095 billion in the same month of the previous year. The value of imported goods from January to November rose 13.7 percent to $73.724 billion from $64.822 billion in the same nine-month period of 2015.
The increase in imports was sustained for the fourth consecutive month in November and was the fastest in six months or since June’s 15.4-percent growth, PSA data showed.
According to state planning agency National Economic and Development Authority, total merchandise trade rose by 7 percent to $12 billion in November.
“The surge in trade transactions with East Asia and the Asean boosted the performance of imports, which also signals an increase in the purchasing power of Filipinos. We expect that this further increased in December 2016,” Pernia, who is also Neda chief, said in a statement.
Pernia said they expect further trade recovery in 2017 amid improving demand from traditional markets whose economies had slowed, such as China, Japan, the European Union and the United States.
The Neda chief added that exports to China would further grow on the plans to sell more agricultural and food products to the mainland.
The Philippines was also eyeing increased trade with Russia, especially exports of herbal and natural medicine, crafts, as well as tourism services, Pernia said.

“Remember that tourism is a services export so tourism is likely to be buoyant this year with the Chinese and the Russians coming,” he added.
Also, imports would continue to be robust amid expectations of more construction activities given the Duterte administration’s infrastructure push, the country’s chief economist said.
Manufacturing, as measured by the volume of production index of the PSA’s Monthly Integrated Survey of Selected Industries, likewise jumped in November by 14.6 percent compared with 4.4 percent a year ago.
“The manufacturing sector is expected to exhibit even stronger growth in December because of increased consumer demand during the Christmas season of 2016 compared to 2015. Looking ahead, we see the sector benefitting from strong private and public investments,” Pernia said.
“Low inflation, low unemployment, and strong remittances will also continue to drive domestic demand, and will boost manufacturing in the Philippines,” the Neda chief added.

Philippines,34474,mb.com.ph,2021-11-04T00:00:00Z,"SC orders dismissal, forfeiture of retirement benefits of ex-NEDA Chief Neri on ZTE deal","Supreme Court (SC)
Instead of only suspension or fine, the Supreme Court (SC) has ordered the dismissal of then Director General Romulo L. Neri of the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) for brokering, “despite knowledge of corruption,” the aborted 2007 transaction with Zhing Xing Telecommunications Equipment (ZTE) for the $325.9 million national broadband network (NBN) project of the government.
While the dismissal is already academic since Neri is no longer NEDA director general, what could be enforced in the SC’s decision — once it becomes final — are the accessory penalties of “cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of leave credits and retirement benefits, and perpetual disqualification from reemployment in the government service.”
The SC decision, promulgated last July 5 and made public last Nov. 11, was written by Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen.
It reversed the Aug. 21, 2009 ruling of the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) which found Neri guilty of misconduct and imposed on him a six-month suspension without pay as NEDA director general.
On Neri’s appeal, the CA modified the OMB’s ruling as it declared him guilty of simple misconduct and imposed on him a fine equivalent to his six months salaries. He elevated the case to the SC.
Published reports stated that Neri’s graft case filed in 2010 in the NBN-ZTE deal had been dismissed by the Sandiganbayan in 2016. The anti-graft court granted his demurrer to evidence, a pleading filed to dismiss the case on the ground that the prosecution’s evidence cannot sustain a conviction.
Former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who scrapped the NBN-ZTE deal, had also been cleared of the graft and other charges by the Sandiganbayan, also on a demurrer to evidence. When the judgment of acquittal was elevated to the SC, the High Court dismissed the petition on Arroyo’s constitutional right against double jeopardy.
The NBN-ZTE deal, which started in 2006, was for the installation of a nationwide public telecommunications infrastructure to link all government agencies and offices.
After the deal was awarded to ZTE in 2007, there had been allegations of corruption which, among other incidents, led to a Senate inquiry.
Thereafter, a complaint was filed before the OMB against Neri, then President Arroyo and several other persons for alleged graft and violations of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). Among the complaints were Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr., Harry L. Roque, Jr., Ma. Dominga B. Padilla, Roel Garcia, Bebu Bulchand, and Fr. Jose P. Dizon.
In the case of Neri, the complaints alleged that he should be charged with dereliction of duties under Article 208 of the RPC for maliciously refraining from instituting prosecution and tolerating the corruption surrounding the deal.
The complainants also alleged that as head of NEDA, Neri had a hand in approving the deal because the agency’s approval was required. After a fact-finding investigation, he was charged with grave misconduct and dishonesty.
On April 21, 2009, the OMB found Neri guilty of misconduct and suspended him for six months without pay.
On Neri’s appeal, the CA found him liable for only simple misconduct. The appellate court imposed a fine equivalent to six months salaries.
In his SC petition, Neri alleged that he could not stop the evaluation of the ZTE’s bid for the NBN because NEDA had to automatically review the transaction.
He also told the SC he even warned NEDA’s staff to be cautious in evaluating the bid because of a bribe offer. At the same time, he said NEDA’s approval only pertained to the economic feasibility of the project and his office did not choose ZTE as the contractor.
At the same time, Neri said his meetings with other personalities involved in the deal and his dinner with ZTE officials were invitations from the Chinese Embassy officials as part of diplomatic protocols. He insisted he did not accept any bribe.
He also pointed out that he merely followed the President’s advice “to refuse the bribe offer … and just proceed with the processing of the … project.”
Thus, he said, he acted in good faith in obeying the orders of a superior, he being the vice chair of NEDA while the President was its chairperson.
Denying his petition, the SC, among other legal points, said:
“Petitioner (Neri) attempts to wash his-hands by claiming that he was merely following then President Macapagal-Arroyo’s orders. He maintains that he cannot be held accountable because he was only a part of the collegial body that approved the deal.
“We cannot accept this argument. As part of the Board of the National Economic and Development Authority, petitioner cannot pass on his liability to the President. His vote and opinion on the matter must be viewed separately from the President’s. His roles as the director general of the agency and the vice chair of its board cannot be emasculated as a powerless position, blindly following the President’s orders.
“All these make it clear that petitioner committed grave misconduct. To reiterate, this Court shall respect the Office of the Ombudsman’s findings of fact when they are supported by substantial evidence.
“Here, the Court of Appeals erred in deeming the misconduct as only simple, seeing as how the elements of corruption and clear intent to violate the law are quite patent.
“Petitioner actively brokered for ZTE’s bid by using his public position despite knowing the corruption involved in the project. There is no cogent reason to justify the lowering of liability to simple misconduct.
“The Constitution and our laws demand a high standard of ethics from public officials and employees. Petitioner’s acts undoubtedly fell short of this standard and diminished the people’s confidence in the government.
“WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED. The assailed July 3, 2013 Decision and May 5, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 114299 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner Romulo L.

A plane from Xiamen arrived in the city last week, marking the start of the Xiamen-Davao route, and Alejandre said the Guangzhou-Davao route should open next year.

Philippines,32293,inquirer.net,2021-05-20T13:52:15Z,Poe backs convening NSC for PH's stand on WPS issue,"MANILA, Philippines — Immediately convening the National Security Council (NSC) in order to come up with a united stand on the country’s maritime dispute with China would be a “timely intervention,” Senator Grace Poe said Thursday.
“It is high time that the whole of government comes up with a clear and united stand on the West Philippine Sea issue. The convening of the National Security Council ASAP would be a timely intervention,” Poe said in a statement.

“We cannot be divided as a nation when we talk about our sovereignty. Protecting territorial integrity is so vital to a country’s survival that we must not confuse it with friendship or utang na loob,” she added.
This, as she backed the call of former Senator Rodolfo Biazon to convene the NSC amid the Philippine government’s “confusing” stand on the West Philippine Sea issue.
“This is the country’s resources we are talking about. There shouldn’t be any debate as to whether we should protect it or not. There is only one constitutional answer—we should. The only thing left for us to discuss now is how,” Poe went on.
Biazon, also a former Armed Forces chief, earlier personally went to the Senate to call for the convening of the NSC.
“The NSC can provide us, the Filipino people, everybody—including the policymakers, national policymakers, national program implementers, and our people— a very clear projection of a clear, united national position on this,” Biazon said in an interview in the Senate.
“Because right now, we are confused and that is dangerous. We are not only confusing ourselves, we are also confusing potential allies in our pursuit of our national interests in the area. We are confusing our policymakers and program implementers,” he added.
President Rodrigo Duterte has earned criticisms over what many see as “confusing” remarks on the West Philippine Sea issue.
These pronouncements include him calling the Philippine’s victory against China at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague a “piece of paper” that could be thrown away in the wastebasket.
Duterte also denied promising to retake the West Philippine Sea during his 2016 campaign, saying he was only joking when he said he would ride a jet ski to the Spratlys to plant a Philippine flag there.

Despite this, the President insisted that the disputed waters belong to the Philippines.
Meanwhile, Duterte’s foreign affairs and defense chiefs have been issuing strong statements against China’s recent actions in the area.
The Department of Foreign Affairs has been filing numerous diplomatic protests against China, the most recent one being Beijing’s “unilateral imposition” of a fishing ban in the South China Sea, which covers parts of the West Philippine Sea.

Durian (MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO)
The deal, which primarily includes durian and other tropical fruits, is worth $2.09 billion and was sealed through the “Protocol of the Phytosanitary Requirements for Export of Fresh Durians from the Philippines to China"" that was signed during President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s state visit to China on Jan. 4.
“he project is expected to generate at least 10,000 direct and indirect jobs from the bilateral venture,” the agriculture department said in a statement.
DA Undersecretary Domingo F. Panganiban said the country will initially export durian from the list of registered farms in major durian production areas of Davao City, Davao del Sur, and North Cotabato.
“We hope and anticipate that this will be a major breakthrough that we should avail of and hope that we should be able to maintain a good relationship with China in the long run,” he said.
In fact, Panganiban said that the Chinese companies including the Dole (Shanghai) Fruits and Vegetables Trading Co., Ltd/Dole China, Prestige International Co. Ltd., Shanghai Goodfarmer Group, and the Dashang Group already made purchase commitments worth $260 million for 2023.
Production expansion
The agriculture department is currently gearing up for the expansion of the country’s production of durian and other high-value crops following the recent state visit that secured a $2-billion fruit deal.
In a meeting, Panganiban and Assistant Secretary for Operations Arnel De Mesa discussed with concerned Regional Executive Directors (REDs) and Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) officials the necessary measures on how to boost the durian production of the Philippines to cater to the demand of the Chinese market.
Panganiban has instructed REDs to immediately identify the potential areas for expansion and formulate the necessary work and financial plans to sustain the durian export.
The Regional Field Offices (RFOs) will also carry out capacity-building activities, ensure the production of market-preferred varieties, develop packing houses, and help with marketing in coordination with the BPI and the High-Value Crops Development Program (HVCDP), which is headed by Gerald Glenn Panganiban.
As such, Panganiban vowed that the BPI will give support in accreditation, PhilGAP certification, and protocol implementation, among others.

In 2013, the Aquino administration challenged China’s claim to nearly all of the 3.5-million-square-kilometer South China Sea in the UN-backed Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague after China seized Panatag Shoal (international name: Scarborough Shoal), a rich fishing ground off the coast of Zambales province.
Case resolved in PH favor
In July 2016, shortly after President Duterte came to power, the tribunal decided the challenge in favor of the Philippines, ruling that China’s sweeping claim has no basis in international law and that it has violated the Philippines’ sovereign right to fish and explore for resources in the West Philippine Sea, waters within the country’s 370-kilometer exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea.
Mr. Duterte, however, put the ruling in the back burner, preferring friendship with China and wooing the Asian economic powerhouse for aid, loans and investments.
China has made billions of dollars in investment pledges for Philippine infrastructure projects and the Duterte administration has kept silent over Beijing’s construction of military bases on artificial islands that it has developed on seven of Manila’s reefs in the Spratly archipelago. —Julie M.

The Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FFCCCII) has expressed full support for the recently signed rice tariffication law, which imposes tariffs on rice imports in lieu of quantitative restrictions (QR).
In a statement released by the Department of Finance (DOF), it quoted a letter from FFCCCII, which said the group believes the rice tariffication law is a “much-needed reform” that will ease the negative effects of inflation especially on the poorest of the poor.
The FFCCCII said the rice tariffication bill will benefit the most low-income families as this staple food accounts for a hefty part of their daily household expense.
“Rice is the staple food of our nation and it comprises almost 20 percent of the household expense of low-income households,” FFCCCII said in its letter signed by its president Domingo Yap and sent to President Rodrigo R. Duterte.

Philippines,20200,manilastandard.net,2019-04-12T20:35:00Z,Local manufacturing sector to benefit from US-China row,"The domestic manufacturing sector will benefit from the ongoing trade war between the world’s top economic powerhouse, the United States and China, an Asian Development Bank official said. Mahinthan Joseph Mariasingham, an ADB statistician who spoke in a recent symposium jointly organized by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, Philippine APEC Study Center Network, and Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research, said the Philippine manufacturing could see a boost of 0.2 percent to 0.7 percent, mainly in electronics. “The assumption is that [the] PH economy is able to attract more trade from tariff-affected economies,” Mariasingham said, adding electronics was one of the manufacturing sub-sectors highly integrated into the global value chain. He said from the imposition of tariffs on selected products such as solar panels, washers, steel, and aluminum, globally, the US started imposing duties on a wide range of products imported from China. Mariasingham said the US imports nearly $600 billion worth of goods and services from China, while the latter only buys about $130 billion worth of goods, making it the more affected between the two countries. Globally, these trade conflicts “would have a small impact on the world’s gross domestic product,” but could present substantial risks once they escalate. On the other hand, the regional impacts could be offset “by potential redirection of trade and production,” he said. Mariasingham said countries not affected by the imposition of tariffs could absorb imports and exports both from China and the US, which would have been affected by the ongoing trade war. He added this could be beneficial for developing Asian countries such as Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand.“Do you know why these three countries stand out today much higher than the rest of the [other] countries? Simply because they have the infrastructure to absorb the excess demand that would arise as a result of the imposition of tariffs by the US on Chinese products, mainly on electronic goods,” Mariasingham said. In the Philippines, he said the manufacturing sector would gain more as a result of the trade conflict because of the huge electronics component sector of the country. However, he urged policymakers in the country to focus on investing more on research and development, as well as on developing the technical capacity of Filipinos to encourage them to engage in higher value-added tasks. Mariasingham noted that the services sector would feel positive effects albeit small, but warned that the business services would be negatively affected “if conflict escalates”. He also reminded countries benefitting from the US-China trade wars not to be complacent as they need to compete with others, noting that some of its positive effects “may take a while to play out.”",0,,,"{'USA': ['United States'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'MYS': ['Malaysia'], 'VNM': ['Socialist Republic of Vietnam'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines']}",trade_financial_sanction,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']

That came along with similar moves by banks in several other countries including Britain, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, the Philippines and Indonesia — all pointing to a dark outlook for equities.

In a sign that recession expectations are rising, the yield on a 10-year US Treasury jumped to 3.7 percent, its highest level in a decade, while the S&P 500 sank to its weakest level since June and just above its 2022 lows.
There were also losses on the Nasdaq and Dow, while London, Paris and Frankfurt shed more than one percent apiece.
Asia largely followed suit, though bargain-buying provided a modicum of support.
Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington, Taipei and Manila all dropped.
The dollar, which has surged to multi-decade highs against its major peers as well as emerging currencies, held its strength.
Traders are keeping a close eye on developments following the Japanese finance ministry’s intervention to support the yen, after it hit a new 24-year low of 146 against the dollar.
The first such intervention since 1998, it helped strengthen the yen to just above 140.
However, analysts warned the move was unlikely to have much long-term impact and the yen remained vulnerable owing to the Bank of Japan’s refusal to tighten policy — citing a need to boost the economy — as the Fed ramps up rates.
“Given the now even starker contrast between the (central bank’s) policy stance and central banks everywhere else in the world… (the) MoF will need to be in this intervention game for the long haul and in size if it is to have much hope of arresting yen weakness in an ongoing strong dollar environment,” said National Australia Bank’s Ray Attrill.
Oil markets remain subdued by concerns about a hit to demand caused by the expected recession.
Both main contracts fluctuated as speculation swirled that OPEC and other major producers could cut output as they fear prices are falling too fast.
The commodity has fallen about a third from highs seen soon after Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine, and is even below levels seen before the conflict.
“This is going to be a very, very volatile last quarter,” said Amrita Sen, of Energy Aspects, on Bloomberg Television. She added that there were “just too many different and contradictory factors driving prices right now”.

Philippines,39301,mb.com.ph,2023-09-09T09:27:00Z,Nat’l Security Council eyes ‘Tiktok’ ban among workers in security sector,"A prohibition on the use of video-sharing application “Tiktok” among personnel in the security sector is being considered by the National Security Council (NSC).
At a news forum in Quezon City on Saturday, Sept. 9, NSC Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya said the move is part of their effort to raise consciousness among its personnel on the possible psychological warfare and misinformation on the social media platform.
However, Malaya clarified that the plan is still being carefully studied so as not to raise conflict on the right of the public to self-expression.
If approved, Malaya said the ban will only be limited to personnel in the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and other intelligence government agencies.
Relatedly, AFP spokesperson Col. Medel Aguilar said a new security policy is being implemented in all military facilities nationwide, particularly on the use of cellular phones and other electronic devices, and social media on duty.
“We initiated precautionary measures so that we can be insulated from any conduct of espionage if there is anyone using these applications. But as far as its usage on (an) individual by our personnel, there is a policy already on the use of social media platforms,” he said.
Aguilar said this was to ensure the security of the organization and its personnel, and to maintain the credibility and good image of the AFP.
Tiktok is a video-sharing social media platform owned by tech company ByteDance, which is based in Beijing, China.
Tiktok is reportedly banned in a number of countries.

Philippines,15043,manilastandard.net,2018-02-12T19:15:00Z,Market declines on rate hike fears,"The stock market fell Monday on higher inflation prospects by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and on fears it will raise interest rates next month. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index lost 15.78 points, or 0.2 percent, to 8,487.91 on a value turnover of just P5.9 billion. Losers beat gainers, 118 to 94, with 36 issues unchanged. Jollibee Foods Corp., the biggest fastfood chain, declined 3.1 percent to P283, while DMCI Holdings Inc. of the Consunji Group, which is into coal mining, power generation, water distribution and property development, dropped 2.9 percent to P13.40. Prime Orion Philippines Inc., controlled by Ayala Land Inc., jumped 28.1 percent to P3.65, while Now Corp., which is bidding to become the third telecommunications company in the Philippines, surged 9.7 percent to P7.90. The rest of Asian markets mostly rose on Monday as buyers cautiously returned after last week’s global rout, with confidence boosted by a rally on Wall Street but analysts warning of further volatility. After a stellar 2017 and a January that saw record and multi-year highs around the world, traders are scurrying to the hills this month as a strong economic outlook—particularly in the US—healthy corporate earnings and rising inflation have sent borrowing costs surging. Equity markets, for years buoyed by post-crisis stimulus, have spiraled into the red as traders fret that the era of cheap cash is at an end. But Monday got off to a calm start. Hong Kong, which sank more than nine percent last week, was up 0.7 percent in the afternoon while Shanghai closed up 0.8 percent and Singapore rose 0.6 percent.Seoul gained 0.9 percent, with traders cheered by signs of a thaw in relations between North and South Korea during the Winter Olympics after Kim Jong Un—whose sister attended the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang—invited the South’s President Moon Jae-in for a summit in Pyongyang. Taipei added 0.5 percent and Bangkok 0.3 percent but Sydney eased 0.3 percent and Manila dipped 0.5 percent. Tokyo was closed for a public holiday. The gains came after a late rally on Wall Street helped all three main indexes end on a positive note Friday, though still well down over the week. However, there are expectations that profit-taking will lead to further losses, with Brian Culpepper at James Investment Research warning: “Stocks are extremely expensive.” Eyes are now on the release this week of US inflation figures, which market-watchers say will be key to future movements. “With powerful US economic signals and interest rates most certainly to rise quicker than expected, last week’s tumult could be little more than the start of the equity roller-coaster,” said Stephen Innes, head of Asia-Pacific trading at OANDA. “Given all this ruckus started with an uptick in the wage growth component from this month’s (US jobs report) release, this week’s US inflation data will be a monster of a print.” While the week got off to a positive start, energy firms took another hiding after further recent falls in the price of oil due to rising US production and the spillover from the equity market rout.

Philippines,17618,manilatimes.net,2018-08-27T00:13:20Z,US-China trade war worsens,"GIL H. A. SANTOSOVER the weekend, the US-China trade war turned worse as President Donald Trump linked it directly to the continued North Korean nuclear development program—despite the UN sanctions for violating the international reduction of nuclear armaments—and indirectly accused Beijing of using it as a weapon in their trade war.In international news service reports from Washington, Trumped stopped the scheduled fourth trip of US State Secretary Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang for another round of denuclearization and peace negotiations with his counterpart until the US-China “…trading relationship is resolved.”This latest geopolitical development came after the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna reported that the “continued and farther development of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRP) nuclear program and related statements by the DPRK are a cause for grave concern.”The Washington reports attributed to the White House spokesperson quoted Trump as saying “…additionally, because of our much tougher trading stance with China, I don’t believe they (China) are helping the process of (North Korean) denuclearization as they once were (despite the UN sanctions which are in place).”Of course, and naturally, China denies this and claims in its domestic and international propaganda/“information campaign” that its foreign policy is designed for global “cooperation and peace.” But it totally ignores world criticism of its military buildup in man-made atolls and reefs in the international waters of the disputed South China Sea region.Beijing has anchored its foreign policy on the One Belt One Road (OBOR) technical and financial assistance offered to the world’s developing economies. Its aim is to directly link China’s sources of raw materials to its factories to turnout cheap—but inferior quality—products for its manufacturing-exporting hybrid economy.The reports appear to be the first open admission by the White House, though in not so many words, in published reports that China has been using—and assisting—North Korea’s continued development of a miniature nuclear rocket capable of hitting American mainland cities, as a tool of Beijing in the ambition to be the world’s top superpower in his century.This can mean one sure immediate future development: the fallout of the trade war will be harsher on underdeveloped or developing economies of the world, including the Asean member nations, and close neighbors of China, especially when and if a currency crises follow.Researchers of government think-tanks and academic scholars can easily trace the consequences of the 1997 Asian financial crises, and the history of economic recessions since the late 1920s that led to World War 2 in 1939 through the geopolitical evolutions for lessons learned.Hopefully, last week’s Beijing visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Mohammad Mahathir and the warning statement of President Rodrigo Duterte on the West Philippine Sea explorations are the start of a unified Asean action on China’s OBOR projects.Mahathir scrapped the $22-billion OBOR project deal with China because it would drive Malaysia into a debt trap Kuala Lumpur could not pay. He was trying to renegotiate the agreement but President Xi Jinping obviously was not responsive that he had to cancel it. Mahathir said repaying Malaysia’s debts was his regime’s priority now, not the railway and pipeline projects.The Malaysian statement issued in Beijing at the end of his visit said 88 percent of the cost of the two oil pipelines in Sabah and Kedah had already been “paid to the Chinese contractor despite only 13 percent [being] completed.”Duterte warned China—after repeated Chinese warnings against Philippine military supply ships and planes delivering provisions to small Filipino communities in the West Philippine Sea—against exploring, and extracting, for oil and uranium in the area to avoid war. Besides, the Philippines does not pose a threat to China in any way.He said “there will be trouble if China grabs for oil and uranium…” in the area.These developments gain more importance because next month is the start of the negotiations to finalize the draft of the Code of Conduct (COC), in the South China Sea, the basis of a working agreement between China and the 10 individual Asean members as to how conflicts in the SCS will be resolved.China has been delaying the negotiation for the last 15 years and does not want to sign any agreement with Asean as a group but as individual sovereign nation-states.International geopolitical and economic analysts have warned against the OBOR offers of Beijing because of the danger of debt trap; huge financial and technical assistance could force the recipient economies into more national financial loans they can repay on the basis of a 50-year (or more) timeline only.Now that China is internationally recognized as an “economic miracle” and a superpower, it is relevant for the Asean 10 to intensify their studies and research on how China uses all available instruments of diplomacy—to win friends and influence people—for its own national interest, aligned with or diametrically opposite ours.This is imperative now, world history shows us, because of the dynamics of evolution and in this the information communication technology age. And whatever happens to the superpowers will certainly affect us all.China is currently intensifying its drive to convince small countries still closely allied (and trading) with Taiwan although they recognize mainland China or the People’s Republic.Take the case of Palau, a small South Pacific Island state about 500 miles east of Mindanao. Beijing banned Chinese tourists to Palau claiming it is an “illegal destination” for “lack of diplomatic status” (it is not yet a fully independent sovereign member country of the UN). China wants Palau to accept mainland China tourists only—a pressure it has been putting on Palau to formally acknowledge Taiwan as a province of China under Beijing’s one-China policy.Palau is unmoved and sticks to Taiwan as a close traditional ally and trading partner.Or Sri Lanka, which reportedly agreed to its OBOR railway project with Beijing payable in 99 years. Now China wants a naval base instead and is reportedly putting pressure on Colombo to agree.Or Djibouti by the southeast entrance to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal from the Arabian Sea, where the China’s People’s Liberation Army—the world’s largest armed forces—now has its first naval base outside its sovereign territory.Beijing wants naval bases and roads to prevent rival economies –and this is primarily the US and its allies, which it believes are dedicated to prevent China from succeeding on her “predestination in this century”—from controlling choke points in the high seas to have sustained raw supplies for energy and the Chinese factories.Aseans must be always on the alert for any negative developments in the domestic politics of the superpowers to strategically anticipate and choose their individual and collective options to survive any backlash or war. Because while nobody wants a world war, it is not automatically erased as a possibility in the present environment.Comments and reactions to gilsmanilatimes@yahoo.com.",0,,,"{'USA': ['United States', 'Washington', 'Vienna'], 'PRK': ['Democratic People’s Republic of Korea', 'Pyongyang'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'South China Basin'], 'MYS': ['Malaysia', 'Sabah', 'Kedah', 'Kuala Lumpur'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Mindanaw'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan'], 'PLW': ['Republic of Palau'], 'LKA': ['Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka', 'Colombo'], 'DJI': ['Republic of Djibouti'], 'SDN': ['Red Sea'], 'EGY': ['Suez Canal'], 'None': ['Arabian Sea']}",trade_financial_sanction,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,15496,manilatimes.net,2018-03-25T00:22:54Z,Trade war will jeopardize global economy,"A trade war instigated by the Trump administration is the last thing the global economy needs right now.
Reaction by the stock markets around the world alone should be taken by the White House as a signal that there is very little upside for the United States in a tit-for-tat trade war.
On Friday, Philippine share prices sank and the peso weakened further amid renewed fears the world could be headed toward a trade war after US President Donald Trump announced the imposition of tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese products.
Trump could also be underestimating the pushback from Beijing and Brussels.
China has expressed readiness to raise tariffs on an initial $6 billion worth of American exports, with its commerce ministry warning that while “China does not want to fight a trade war, [it]is absolutely not afraid of a trade war.”
French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe would respond “without weakness” to Washington’s threats of tariffs on steel and aluminum; at the end of a European summit in Brussels, he said: “Nothing should be addressed when it is with a gun to your head.”
Trump seems to be ill advised on his protectionist trade policies. The US economy’s lack of competitiveness in trade is a structural issue in the economic sense and cannot be resolved by tariff policy.
There are several reasons why the US incurred a record $375.2-billion trade deficit with China last year, and it’s not because Washington’s trade policy is lax.
The Trump White House appears to have partly identified the cause of the yawning trade gap with China: the new tariffs are being imposed on Chinese goods whose technology may have been “stolen” from the US.
This is a losing cause in a global and digital economy where technological obsolescence is swifter than ever.
First of all, there are mechanisms to punish Chinese manufacturers for copying American technology. Eventually, however, American manufacturers need to adapt, innovate and make it hard for copycats to succeed.
This is not a tall order for Japanese, Swedish, British and many other successful global enterprises, whose products may have been copied by China at some point.
Their response was to innovate further, not pressure their home governments to launch a trade war with Beijing.
World Trade Organization (WTO) Director General Roberto Azevêdo made a timely reminder on Friday at the meeting of the body’s Council on Trade in Goods: trade powers should set the example by taking advantage of, and not bypassing, the rules-based global trading system.
Azevêdo’s words bear repeating here: “Actions taken outside these collective processes greatly increase the risk of escalation in a confrontation that will have no winners, and which could quickly lead to a less stable trading system.”
He added: “Disrupting trade flows will jeopardize the global economy at a time when economic recovery, though fragile, has been increasingly evident around the world. I again call for restraint and urgent dialogue as the best path forward to resolve these problems.”
Indeed, a trade war will disrupt not just the US and China, but the entire global economy, including smaller but nonetheless trade-dependent players such as the Philippines and other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Trump risks the global economy’s fragile health by choking its lifeblood, the free flow of trade.",0,,,"{'None': ['Europe'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Washington', 'Brussels'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines']}",trade_financial_sanction,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,27942,mb.com.ph,2020-07-16T11:36:56Z,China unfazed by threat of sanctions by US – Manila Bulletin,"China is not afraid of the threat of sanctions by the United States over the South China Sea issue, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Wednesday.“Speaking of sanctions, China is not afraid of them. However, as an old Chinese saying goes, ‘a tree wants to enjoy a moment of tranquility but the wind keeps blowing.’ If the US wants to make a storm, then just let the storm rage with greater force!” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said.Beijing’s latest reaction came following the remarks made by US State Assistant Secretary for East Asia David Stilwell saying that “nothing’s off the table” on whether Washington would consider using sanctions against Chinese enterprises or officials engaged in the South China Sea.Stilwell also maintained that the US will no longer remain on the sidelines when China uses “gangster tactics” like blocking access of fishermen in Scarborough Shoal (also known as Panatag Shoal or Bajo de Masinloc) or militarizing the area.Hua chided the US as “pathetic” for wantonly imposing sanctions or threatening to sanction others.“We hope ‘sanction’ is not going to be the biggest and shiniest label that the US wants itself to be remembered by. It should earnestly reflect on its policies,” the Chinese foreign ministry official added.Hua insisted that China will continue to uphold its sovereignty, security, and legitimate rights and interests in the large swathe of waters being contested by other countries such as the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Vietnam.On July 12, 2016, the Arbitral Tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippine petition invalidating China’s outrageous “nine-dash line” claim in the South China Sea.Beijing did not participate in the arbitral proceedings and even rejected the award of the United Nations-backed court.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'South China Basin'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Washington', 'South China', 'Hague'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila'], 'BRN': ['Brunei Darussalam'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan'], 'MYS': ['Malaysia', 'Taman South East Asia']}",trade_financial_sanction,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,28078,inquirer.net,2020-08-27T20:46:44Z,China criticizes US sanctions over South China Sea buildup,"BEIJING — China on Thursday accused the United States of violating international law by imposing sanctions on officials and companies involved in Beijing’s military buildup in the disputed South China Sea, but gave no indication of how it might retaliate.
The sanctions add to conflict over control of the sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. The U.S. rejects China’s claim to virtually the entire waterway, portions of which are also claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines and other governments.

“The relevant U.S. acts grossly interfere in China’s internal affairs, violate international law and relevant international norms, which are totally out of hegemonic logic and power politics,” foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said.
The U.S. Commerce Department on Wednesday announced penalties against an unspecified number of Chinese officials and 24 companies for their role in building artificial islands to enforce Beijing’s territorial claims. The companies were added to an “entity list” that limits access to U.S. exports without government permission.
“China will take firm measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of its enterprises and individuals,” Zhao said.
Chinese officials frequently make such vows, although specific responses are rare.
The Commerce Department said the companies were targeted for their role in building the artificial islands through dredging and other activities that cause environmental damage and infringe on other nations’ claims.
“The relevant construction China carried out on its own territory is entirely within the scope of sovereignty and has nothing to do with militarization,” Zhao said. “There is no reason for the U.S. side to impose illegal sanctions on Chinese enterprises and individuals because of their participation in relevant domestic construction.”
Tensions in the South China Sea have been building as the U.S. and others push back against Beijing’s moves to cement its control over the area.
U.S.-China relations have declined to their lowest level in years amid disputes over trade, technology, Taiwan, Hong Kong and human rights.
China is currently holding live-fire military exercises in both the South and East China Seas and a Hong Kong newspaper reported Thursday that the military test-fired two missiles into the South China Sea, including one seen as specifically designed to attack a U.S. aircraft carrier.

The DF-26B and DF-21D missiles fired Wednesday targeted an area between the southern island province of Hainan and the Paracel Islands, the South China Morning Post reported, citing unidentified sources close to the Chinese military.

Philippines,13254,inquirer.net,2017-08-07T14:48:48Z,Welcome boost from China to global pressure on North Korea,"A global pressure campaign on North Korea propelled by sharp new UN sanctions received a welcome boost Sunday from China, the North’s economic lifeline, as Beijing called on its neighbor to halt its missile and nuclear tests.
The Trump administration cautiously embraced China’s apparent newfound cooperation, while putting it on notice that the US would be watching closely to ensure it didn’t ease up on Pyongyang if and when the world’s attention is diverted elsewhere. But there were no signs the US would acquiesce to China’s call for a quick return to negotiations.
ADVERTISEMENT
The diplomatic wrangling sought to build on the sweeping new North Korea sanctions passed by the UN Security Council a day earlier – the strongest in a generation, the US said. As diplomats gathered in the Philippines for an annual regional meeting, President Donald Trump was cheering the move from afar. He touted the “very big financial impact” of the sanctions and noted optimistically that both China and Russia had joined in the unanimous vote.
“It was a good outcome,” US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in characteristically understated fashion as he met with South Korea’s top diplomat.
For the US, it was a long-awaited sign of progress for Trump’s strategy of trying to enlist Beijing’s help to squeeze Pyongyang diplomatically and economically. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, meeting with North Korea’s top diplomat during the gathering in Manila, urged the North to “maintain calm” despite the UN vote.
“Do not violate the UN’s decision or provoke international society’s goodwill by conducting missile launching or nuclear tests,” Wang said, in an unusually direct admonition.
Though Beijing repeated its call for the United States and North Korea to resume talks, the US said that was still premature, and rejected yet again a Chinese call for the US to freeze joint military exercises with South Korea in exchange for the North halting nuclear development. Pyongyang views the military exercises as rehearsals for an invasion.
The US also warned it planned to rigorously monitor China’s compliance with the new penalties. Susan Thornton, the top US diplomat for Asia, said Beijing had historically cooperated with sanctions after flagrant North Korean violations but then slipped back over time.
“We want to make sure China is continuing to implement fully the sanctions regime,” Thornton told reporters in Manila. “Not this kind of episodic back and forth that we’ve seen.”
Infusing the diplomatic gathering with dramatic intrigue was the presence of Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, the odd man out at a meeting dominated by concerns about his nation’s nuclear proliferation. Indeed, the US was floating a proposal to temporarily kick North Korea out of the 27-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, although other member nations are divided about that idea.
Would Tillerson trade pleasantries with his North Korean counterpart as they cross paths at the regional gathering, or potentially even sit for a meeting? It was a question driving the hallway chatter at the gathering, but the US summarily shot down the prospect.
ADVERTISEMENT
Though Tillerson has emphasized the Trump administration’s willingness to sit down with North Korea for negotiations, he’s said that won’t happen until the North agrees to abandon its nuclear aspirations. Even with new UN sanctions in place intended to drive Pyongyang back to the table, conditions still aren’t ripe for talks, US diplomats said.
But Wang, the Chinese envoy, cast the North Korean foreign minister’s presence in Manila as a positive, enabling him to “hear the voices from other sides.” Speaking in Chinese, Wang said that Ri “also has the right to share his opinions.”
The North Korean envoy hasn’t spoken publicly since arriving in the Philippines. But a commentary in the ruling party’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper said Washington had disregarded the warning the North sent with its intercontinental ballistic missile tests and was pursuing “desperate efforts” in the form of stepped-up sanctions.
“Now the US mainland is on the crossroads of life and death,” the commentary warned.
The new sanctions could cut off roughly one-third of North Korea’s estimated $3 billion in annual exports, ostensibly denying the nation of funds for its weapons programs. All countries are now banned from importing North Korean coal, iron, lead and seafood products, and from letting in more North Korean laborers whose remittances help fund Kim Jong Un’s regime.
The U.S. drafted the sanctions resolution and negotiated it with China following North Korea’s unprecedented test of an ICBM in July and a follow-up test weeks later. Those tests sharply escalated U.S. fears that Pyongyang is a key step closer to mastering the technology needed to strike American soil with a nuclear-tipped missile.
Yet despite deeming North Korea a top security threat, the young Trump administration has struggled to find a strategy that differs significantly from what the U.S. has tried in the past. Aside from calling for more sanctions, Trump’s approach has centered on enlisting China – the North’s biggest trading partner – and others to lessen ties to Pyongyang.
Trump’s initial optimism about China’s willingness to help gave way to public exasperation, with Trump saying Chinese President Xi Jinping had “tried” but that it “has not worked out.” Trump’s administration began floating potential plans to punish China for its trade practices in what was widely perceived as a reaction to China’s inaction on North Korea.
But in recent days, the two powers have started to paper over some of those differences. Beijing praised Tillerson for declaring the U.S. wasn’t seeking regime change in North Korea. Trump has held off, for now, on the trade actions. And China joined the 15-0 vote in the Security Council on Saturday on the new sanctions.
“Who has been carrying out the U.N. Security Council resolutions concerning North Korea? It is China,” Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, said Sunday. “Who bore the cost? It is also China.”

Philippines,498,inquirer.net,2012-04-29T20:22:26Z,PH urged to hit China with trade tariffs; overseas Filipinos set May 11 rallies,"MANILA, Philippines—Hit them where it hurts.”
Balikbayan (returning Filipino) philanthropist, civil leader and lawyer Loida Nicolas-Lewis has called on the government to “show courage” by hitting back at China for “bullying” small countries like the Philippines and violating the country’s territorial sovereignty.
ADVERTISEMENT
Lewis also reminded Filipinos worldwide, including an undisclosed number of Chinese-Filipinos, to rally in front of China’s embassies and consulates on May 11 to protest China’s aggressive encroachments on Scarborough Shoal, located 124 nautical miles west of Zambales province and more than 440 nautical miles from the nearest Chinese port of Hainan.
“China is a bully…She must be hit with moves like trade tariff. Let the Philippine Congress show its courage by passing a law that would impose tariff on all Chinese goods,” Lewis told the Philippine Daily Inquirer on Saturday.
That is, despite the free trade agreement between Beijing and Association of Southeast Nations member-states, like the Philippines, asserted Lewis, chairperson of the New York-based group US Pinoys for Good Governance (USP4GG).
“If China files a case against us before the World Trade Organization for violation of the free trade agreement, then we could pursue our plan to bring the Scarborough Shoal case to the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (based in Hamburg, Germany),” Lewis said.
Citing China’s reported incursions in the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea), she asked: “What kind of world power are they if they are the one violating international laws?”
China should be good global citizen
“As a world power, China should show that it is a good global citizen. It should follow international laws, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea,” said Lewis.
Asked if the US had a role to play in settling the Philippines-China standoff over the shoal – now on its 20th day – Lewis pointed out Washington’s role would be to “comply with its obligations under the Philippines-US Mutual Defense Treaty.”
“The Americans are obligated to come to our aid if China attacks the Philippines…. The US will come to our aid because it is to their self-interest to protect freedom of trade in the West Philippine Sea. If they do not fight with us in the event of a shooting war, then the global community will consider them a second-rate nation,” she said.

At the same time, Lewis cited the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) for its diplomatic offensive in Asean and currently in the US.
“The DFA is on the right track, doing it diplomatically. That is the correct way of solving the dispute at this point,” said Lewis as he thanked both President Aquino and Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario for “standing their ground on the Scarborough Shoal issue.”
Call on Filipinos abroad
Like Rodel Rodis, USP4GG president, Lewis called on the 12 million-plus Filipinos abroad to support the Philippines’ sovereign claim to the Scarborough Shoal, which Manila calls Panatag and Bajo de Masinloc.
On the other hand, China refers to the rock formation as Huangyan Island.
The USP4GG noted that the territorial dispute over the shoal has escalated following these developments:
* Chinese navy ships recently confronted the Philippine navy vessel, the BRP Gregorio del Pilar, which sought to apprehend Chinese boats illegally fishing in the area and found to contain corals, rare fish and live baby sharks, which are considered illegal under Philippine law.
* Chinese navy ships have fired on and harassed unarmed Philippine fishing boats and marine research vessels, forcing them to withdraw.
* Chinese navy ships have dropped steel posts and navigation buoys with Chinese markings in the waters around the shoal.
On Saturday, a Chinese vessel reportedly harassed two Philippine Coast Guard ships by maneuvering close to them at high speed.
The Coast Guard monitored and documented the Chinese “bullying” incidents, said Raul Hernandez, the DFA spokesman.
Gov’t backing
Malacañang over the weekend said it backed the move of Filipino groups worldwide to hold anti-China rallies, but asked them to ensure peaceful activities.
Deputy presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte said the government could “not stop our fellowmen from expressing their sentiments.”
“Our only appeal is for them to make their protests orderly and peaceful since they are in foreign countries. Let us all observe the laws and regulations in whatever country that they are in,” Valte said as she also warned the mass actions could aggravate the current tensions between Manila and Beijing.
She said the government would be “committed to taking the diplomatic track. We expect to pursue that track fully.”
“But, of course, these are private citizens that we have. The citizens of China also do express their thoughts on this matter and we do not take it against them,” she also said.
At the same time, Valte expressed hope China would not retaliate to the Filipinos’ mass actions “because the government remains committed to talking to its counterparts in China, and we hope and we know that this is something that can be settled through the track that the government has chosen.”

“Well, pagdating po sa paglobo ng inflation alam naman po natin na ang pinagmumulan niyan ay ‘yung pagtaas po ng presyo ng krudo. Tumaas na naman po ang presyo ng krudo,” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in a dzMM interview.

The Palace official reiterated the need for the Philippines to have a domestic source of oil rather than merely relying on oil imports.
“Kaya nga po inaatupag natin yung paghahanap ng langis at isa pong option diyan ay ‘yung joint exploration diyan sa West Philippine Sea,” he said.
Roque earlier said that possible joint energy exploration with China in the West Philippine Sea would give the country energy security as oil prices continue to rise in the international market.

Philippines,20959,manilatimes.net,2019-06-09T00:07:43Z,Who is winning big in the supply chain shift from the Sino-US trade war?,"HENRY CHAN
Since the imposition of 25 percent tariff on $34 billion worth of Chinese exports to the United States last July, the trade dispute between the two countries has escalated further, and today Chinese exports to the US valued at $250 billion are subject to 25 percent import duties.
In retaliation, China has also imposed tariffs ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent on $110 billion worth of US exports to China.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump subjected the Chinese telecommunications behemoth, Huawei, to “entity list” restrictions on May 16 and repeatedly talked about imposing 25 percent tariff on the remaining $300 billion Chinese exports to the US.
The Chinese government, at the same time, established an “unreliable entity list” on May 31, targeted against any foreign companies hurting legitimate Chinese commercial interest. It subsequently released a white paper on its position on the Sino-US trade negotiations on June 2.
China is the largest merchandise trading partner of the US. In 2018, its bilateral goods trade with the US amounted to $660 billion, based on a US Census report. China exported products valued at $540 billion and imported $120 billion worth of goods from the US.
The Americans calculated their bilateral trade deficit at $420 billion, but the Chinese countered that the actual gap was smaller. The Chinese argued that a good portion of their exports consisted of products of the global supply chain of US importers and transshipment via Hong Kong that regularly run about $100 billion in profit, retained by importers in Hong Kong. The Chinese calculated the US goods trade surplus at $324 billion.
The US importers procured parts from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan into China and use the country as the final assembly point for products exported to the US. The combined trade deficit that China runs against these three places amounted to $257 billion in 2018, not far from the $324 billion trade surplus with the US quoted by the Chinese. A detailed examination of the goods involved in the Sino-US trade and the trade among the four East Asian countries confirmed the story of the global supply chain, particularly in electronics products. The Asian supply chain run by multinationals and American importers is a good explanation for the persistently high Chinese trade surplus with the US.
As the US initiated this round of the trade war, and China is on the responding side, any meaningful resolution of the trade war lies more in a softening of the US position and President Trump is the deciding factor in any resumption of talks. He is facing reelection in 2020, and the likelihood of a resolution of the trade war diminishes as the November 2020 election gets closer.
The speed of deterioration of the relationship between the two giants is unprecedented in modern history, and many analysts think the dispute has gone beyond the trade imbalance, unfair trade practices and intellectual property protection. The trade arguments are seen to have spilled over into security, ideology and the military arena. A clear majority of analysts now subscribe to the view of a protracted impasse over the trade issue and the likelihood of a solution may come only when both sides are hurt significantly, which at this point is not seen happening.
The Asian supply chain that the American importers have established is now moving out of China. American importers are moving in several fronts to mitigate the sudden disruption of the Asian supply chain center around China built up over the last 20 years. They are busy rewriting contracts to make it easier to pass the tariffs on to customers, shift supply chains out of China where possible, redesign products to avoid Chinese components where they are not present. And with US unemployment hitting a 50-year low, reshoring back to the US is technically not feasible. The beneficiaries of the current impasse are those nations to which Chinese production relocates.
In the first four months of 2019, Chinese exports to the US dropped 13 percent from their 2018 levels, while the vital beneficiary of manufacturing relocation, Vietnam, increased its exports to the US by 40 percent from a year earlier. The Chinese products that showed a decline in shipment matched those of Vietnam shipments that increased.
The Japanese investment bank, Nomura, released a report on the impact of the shifting out of China of the Asian supply chain. It estimated that Vietnam would be the biggest winner in the shift, as its gross domestic product has grown by almost 8 percent as a result of the migration in production. The report also expects Taiwan will benefit from the relocation of many of its manufacturers back to the island, and Malaysia is likewise expected to benefit, though to a lesser degree.
The reconfiguration of the Asian supply chain is a multiyear process, and the opportunities it offers to developing Southeast Asian countries is once in a lifetime. The Philippines missed the first wave of Japanese factory relocation in the 1980s to Southeast Asia; it should not miss the next one coming this time around.
Participating actively in the supply chain will not only boost economic growth and mitigate the unemployment and underemployment problem, but it also allows the building up of human resources in manufacturing and catapults the country to the next level of industrialization. The Asian success story from Japan to China all attest to this model of development, and their histories all point to the importance of government policy in their country’s participation in the supply chain.

Philippines,31070,manilastandard.net,2021-03-07T19:30:00Z,Market wary of rising inflation rate,"Share prices are expected to trade sideways this week amid concerns over a possible interest rate squeeze due to rising inflation rate.

Analysts said the market was preparing for the possibility of a rate increase in the upcoming Monetary Board meeting later this month after inflation gathered pace on rising pork and fuel prices.

“Ultimately, the market will have to deal with the possible rate squeeze that this may entail. With the BSP’s monetary policy meeting just around the corner, expect funds to run more prudent trading strategies,” online brokerage firm 2TradeAsia.com said.

“After all even if dovish rates are maintained, transitory inflation will impact margins negatively, on top of already frail consumer confidence,” it added.

The government last week reported that February inflation rate quickened to 4.7 percent, the highest in over two years

Bank of the Philippine Islands expects inflation to accelerate to 4.3 percent this year from 2.6 percent last year as price pressures may persist until the third quarter.

Meanwhile, investors are monitoring the recent spike in COVID-19 cases, which could be due to new virus variants and relaxed restrictions.

The government is expected to accelerate its vaccination program, using vaccines from Chinese drugmaker Sinovac Biotech and AstraZeneca, as more doses arrive.

The government last week reported that 20 million doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccines could arrive in the Philippines as early as the end of May or early June this year.

 
 The Philippine Stock Exchange last week rose 1.3 percent to 6,881.37. Most of sectoral indices ended in the green led by holding firms, which climbed 2 percent; industrial which advanced 1.5 percent and services which added 0.8 percent.

The mining and oil indices declined 5.1 percent week-on-week.

The average value turnover improved to P13.3 billion while the average net foreign selling improved to P550 million.

US stocks, meanwhile, ended sharply higher on Friday after a whipsaw session in which the belief the US economy was recovering overcame inflation worries, while OPEC’s production restraint pushed crude to levels not seen in nearly two years.

Wall Street share prices struggled this week and bond yields rose while traders debated whether the US recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, fueled by a White House-backed stimulus bill costing nearly $1.9 trillion that is making its way through Congress, would push prices up.

However, government data showing the US economy added a better-than-expected 379,000 jobs in February helped push major indices to a decisively positive finish on Friday, with the Dow climbing 1.9 percent and the S&P 500 gaining 2.0 percent.

“It was good data but still far away from full employment,” Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital Securities said of the employment report.

Inflation concerns caused yields on the 10-year Treasury notes to spike to nearly 1.6 percent, but he said if they stabilize at that level “it is safe to say that the pullback could be over.”",0,,,"{'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'USA': ['United States']}",trade_financial_sanction,['Sinovac Biotech'],['Sinovac Biotech'],['Sinovac Biotech'],['Sinovac Biotech']

Most of the sub-indices gained, led by the mining/oil and property counters. Only the services counter was in the red.
Value turnover for the day amounted to P8.25 billion. There were 98 advancers that beat 67 decliners while 56 stocks were unchanged.
Ayala Land Inc. and Semirara led the day’s gainers, both rising more than 2 percent while SM Investments Corp., Metrobank, Megaworld, Ayala Corp. and First Gen all advanced more than 1 percent. Metro Pacific Investments Corp. and Energy Development Corp. also contributed gains.
On the other hand, PLDT—the day’s most actively traded stock—fell by 1.96 percent after breaking a key support level ahead of the release of 2014 earnings. Alliance Global Group Inc. was also down 2.1 percent. Jollibee also fell 1.27 percent. BDO and Universal Robina Corp. also ended lower.
In a research note, DA Market Securities said that amid uncharted territory, next major resistance was pegged at the low end of the 2015 target range of 8,000-8,500 while initial major support is at 7,485. It said technical indicators were pointing to overbought levels.
“Short-term investors may take profit as stocks reach targets or overbought territory, ahead of a post-earnings period that may be characterized by a lack of leads. Individual stock picks can present opportunities amid rotational nature of the market,” DA Market said. Doris C. Dumlao

Philippines,6675,inquirer.net,2015-08-23T15:51:33Z,PH finance chief hits Chinese yuan devaluation,"The Philippines’ finance chief, Secretary Cesar V. Purisima, on Sunday hit China’s recent move to devalue its tightly controlled currency, which dragged regional currencies weaker.
In a statement, the Department of Finance (DOF) noted that the largest devaluation of the Chinese yuan in 20 years resulted into “turbulence” across Asian currency markets. The Philippine peso, for one, dipped to five-year lows against the US dollar during these past two weeks following the yuan devaluation, alongside other currencies in the region.
ADVERTISEMENT
While the Philippines’ “strong macroeconomic fundamentals and sound economic stewardship” would allow the domestic economy to “navigate the current volatilities and anchor it in safe harbors,” Purisima warned against “using exchange rate to shore up weak growth.”
China devalued the yuan to boost its flagging exports amid weak global demand. A weaker currency stands to benefit China’s export sector, as products become cheaper alongside a weaker yuan.
For Purisima, “[w]e must be mindful of the trade-offs involved in using the exchange rate as a trade tool to boost competitiveness,” pointing out that such would bring “unintended consequences.”
“For one, it may trigger competitive devaluations across the region as other currencies adopt similarly interventionist measures to reprice their currencies,” Purisima noted.
Also, “[a]s currencies weaken, debt service requirements increase and imports become more expensive,” the finance chief said.
“The DOF has consistently called for macroprudential measures to protect financial stability. It warned that gains from devaluation would eventually be weighed against costs as investors may view the weakening yuan as one-way bet and stoke fears of capital flight, resulting in further weakening of the currency,” he added.
Purisima nonetheless said that China’s recovery “will be beneficial for Asia, including the Philippines.”
“China ranked third among the Philippines’ top destinations of exports with revenues amounting to $3.07 billion for the period of January to June 2015. Chinese economic recovery is expected to improve export performance after exports to China suffered a 31.8 percent decline over the comparable level in 2014. Higher growth prospects in China will contribute to our virtuous cycle as China provides a lift to the economy towards sustained and higher growth,” Purisima said.
But as regional currencies take a hit from the yuan devaluation, the Philippine government will adopt “continued vigilance and pre-emptive actions… to ensure sustained economic stability,” the Finance chief said.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We continue to be proactive as virtuous cycles quickly spiraling into vicious cycles are the last thing we want to see happen. We continue to advocate for market-determined exchange rates and curbed excess volatility,” he said.

Philippines,7811,inquirer.net,2016-02-08T10:34:49Z,"UN condemns NKorea launch, pledges significant new sanctions","SEOUL, South Korea — The U.N. Security Council on Sunday strongly condemned North Korea’s launch of a long-range rocket that world leaders denounced as a banned test of dangerous ballistic missile technology and another “intolerable provocation.” The U.N.’s most powerful body pledged to quickly adopt a new resolution with “significant” new sanctions.
North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un went ahead with the launch just two hours after an eight-day window opened early Sunday, and a month after the country’s fourth nuclear test. He ignored an appeal from China, its neighbor and important ally, not to proceed and in another slap to Beijing, he chose the eve of the Chinese New Year, the country’s most important holiday.
ADVERTISEMENT
Since its Jan. 6 nuclear test, which the North claimed was a powerful hydrogen bomb but experts believe was not, China and the United States have been negotiating the text of a new Security Council sanctions resolution.
The U.S., backed by its Western allies, Japan and South Korea, wants tough sanctions reflecting Kim’s defiance of the Security Council. But diplomats say China, the North’s key protector in the council, is reluctant to impose economic measures that could cause North Korea’s economy to collapse.
The 15-member Security Council strongly condemned the launch and pledged to “expeditiously” adopt a new resolution with “further significant measures” — U.N. code for sanctions. The word “robust” referring to the measures was in an initial draft, but was dropped in the final statement.
U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power told reporters that “it cannot be business as usual” after two successive North Korean acts that are “hostile and illegal.”
“What’s important is that the Security Council unites,” Power said. “China is a critical player. … We are hopeful that China, like all council members, will see the grave threat to regional and international peace and security, see the importance of adopting tough, unprecedented measures, breaking new ground here, exceeding the expectations of Kim Jong Un.”
However, China’s U.N. ambassador, Liu Jieyi, made clear that unprecedented sanctions aren’t Beijing’s priority.
He said a new resolution should “do the work of reducing tension, of working toward denuclearization (of the Korean peninsula), of maintaining peace and stability, and of encouraging a negotiated solution.”
“I believe the council needs to work together for a new resolution,” Liu added, indicating that China may want negotiations with the United States to be widened.
Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, whose country is also a North Korean ally, said: “It has to be a weighty resolution, but it also has to be a reasonable resolution” that doesn’t lead to North Korea’s economic or humanitarian collapse, or further heighten tensions.
ADVERTISEMENT
Russia’s goal is to see six-party talks aimed at denuclearization resume, he said, but in the current atmosphere that’s unlikely because the North Koreans “have been very unreasonable” and are challenging the entire international community.
“We think this is wrong for their national interests … for the Korean peninsula … for the region,” Churkin said.
North Korea, which calls its launches part of a peaceful space program, said it had successfully put a new Earth observation satellite, the Kwangmyongsong 4, or Shining Star 4, into orbit less than 10 minutes after liftoff, and vowed more such launches. A U.S. official said it might take days to assess whether the launch was a success.
Japan’s U.N. ambassador, Motohide Yoshikawa, told reporters the missile went over Japan and landed near the Philippines, “a clear threat to the lives of many people.”
The Security Council underscored that launches using ballistic missile technology, “even if characterized as a satellite launch or space launch vehicle” contribute to North Korea’s development of systems to deliver nuclear weapons and violate four Security Council resolutions dating back to the North’s first nuclear test in 2006.
North Korean rocket and nuclear tests are seen as crucial steps toward the North’s ultimate goal of a nuclear-armed missile that could hit the U.S. mainland. North Korea under Kim Jong Un has pledged to bolster its nuclear arsenal unless Washington scraps what Pyongyang calls a hostile policy meant to collapse Kim’s government.
In a development that will worry both Pyongyang and Beijing, a senior South Korean Defense Ministry official, Yoo Jeh Seung, told reporters that Seoul and Washington have agreed to begin talks on a possible deployment of the THADD missile-defense system in South Korea. North Korea has long decried the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, and Beijing would see a South Korean deployment of THAAD, which is one of the world’s most advanced missile-defense systems, as a threat to its interests in the region.
In a statement, North Korea’s National Aerospace Development Administration, in typical propaganda-laden language, praised “the fascinating vapor of Juche satellite trailing in the clear and blue sky in spring of February on the threshold of the Day of the Shining Star.” Juche is a North Korean philosophy focusing on self-reliance; the Day of the Shining Star refers to the Feb. 16 birthday of Kim Jong Un’s father, former dictator Kim Jong Il. North Korea has previously staged rocket launches to mark important anniversaries.
The global condemnation began almost immediately.
South Korean President Park Geun-hye called the launch an “intolerable provocation,” saying the North’s efforts to advance its missile capabilities were “all about maintaining the regime” in Pyongyang and ignored the hardships of ordinary North Koreans.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed to “take action to totally protect the safety and well-being of our people.” U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice called the North’s missile and nuclear weapons programs “serious threats to our interests — including the security of some of our closest allies.”
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the foreign ministers of South Korea and Japan and reaffirmed the United States’ “ironclad commitment to the security and defense” of its allies, the State Department said.
The Foreign Ministry in China expressed “regret that, disregarding the opposition from the international community, the (North) side obstinately insisted in carrying out a launch by using ballistic missile technologies.”
Noting China’s pivotal role in negotiating a new Security Council resolution, Britain’s deputy U.N. ambassador, Peter Wilson, said: “Today is Chinese New Year’s eve and if I was a senior Chinese official I would be pretty annoyed at what’s been happening here. I know what I feel like when I’m dragged out of bed on a major national holiday.”
Kim Jong Un has overseen two of the North’s four nuclear tests and three long-range rocket launches since taking over after the death of his father in late 2011. The U.N. Security Council prohibits North Korea from nuclear and ballistic missile activity. Experts say that ballistic missiles and rockets in satellite launches share similar bodies, engines and other technology.
“If North Korea has only nuclear weapons, that’s not that intimidating. If they have only rockets, that’s not that intimidating, either. But if they have both of them, that means they can attack any target on Earth. So it becomes a global issue,” said Kwon Sejin, a professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.

Cebu Archbishop Jose Palma, the current CBCP president, said he also supported plans of overseas Filipino groups to hold rallies in front of Chinese embassies and consulates across the globe on May 11.

He said he supported “in principle” the proposal to ban products from China.
“Maybe these are procedures or actions which could be discerned by the Filipinos. In truth, I think in principle we have to defend our integrity and supremacy over the land which we believe is our own,” Palma said.
“I agree in the spirit that we should defend our own, I would say, integrity and supremacy,” he added.
Palma said that the planned protest actions in front of Chinese embassies abroad should remain peaceful.
“These are legitimate means to make known our sentiments that we object to the bullying that they’re doing to us,” the archbishop said.
House leaders earlier proposed imposing higher taxes on Chinese products or banning them all together as a form of protest against Chinese aggression.

In another development, Greenergy said its board had approved the move made by Tianjin Tianbao Investment and Development Corp. to assign to its affiliate China Power (Tianjin) New Energy Development Co. Ltd. the memorandum of agreement (MOA) entered into by Greenergy and Tianjin last year.
The Greenergy board also granted China Power the authority to sign agreements in relation to the creation of a joint working committee to conduct final due diligence for the planned power projects.
It can be recalled that under the MOA, Greenergy and Tianjin will jointly develop, fund and operate at least $1.3 billion (roughly P55 billion) worth of wind power projects in the Philippines over the next 10 years.
Under the agreement, the two companies would establish a joint-venture vehicle to plan the development of the wind energy projects that could generate at least 1,000 MW.
An initial investment of $200 million in the wind energy projects is expected in the next two years.
Greenergy also said in the same disclosure that its board of directors had approved the establishment of a new subsidiary to engage in renewable energy and apply for accreditation with the Department of Energy in compliance with existing rules, and the grant of authority to the company or its subsidiary to enter into agreements with government agencies and local government units in relation to solid waste recycling and biomass generation.

The development will create a new commercial and residential area in a densely populated part of Manila. The project has an estimated value of approximately US$720 million (EUR 650 million) of which Boskalis’ share amounts to approximately EUR 325 million.
“We are delighted with the award of this substantial contract from SMPHI. As Boskalis, we have a rich tradition in land reclamation and we look forward to contributing to a modest incremental growth of the Philippines and to protect part of Manila against the effects of climate change,” said Boskalis CEO Peter Berdowski.
He noted that, “This has always been an important region for Boskalis and through this project, we have secured utilization for the large dredging vessels for the coming years.”
The Pasay Reclamation Development Project in Manila Bay is a new and modern commercial and residential property development to be run by SMPHI.
The project involves the reclamation of approximately 360 hectares through the construction of three artificial island according to international standards to ensure a safe living environment.
The islands have been designed to withstand potential large earthquakes. In addition, shore protection works are designed to withstand typhoons.
For the reclamation activities Boskalis will deploy a number of trailing suction hopper dredgers over a period of two years including its mega hopper dredgers. To accelerate the soil settlement, 60,000 kilometers of vertical drains will be installed.
The entire reclamation area will be compacted with vibro- and dynamic compaction to ensure soil stability. The outer perimeter of the islands will be protected with a combination of rock revetment and a concrete wave wall.
Preparatory work is scheduled to commence immediately and work on site is expected to start within the first quarter of 2020. The reclamation activities are expected to be completed within three years and the total project duration including land development is five years.",1,,,"{'NLD': ['Kingdom of the Netherlands'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Pasay', 'Manila', 'Manila Bay']}",investment,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Philippines,18318,mb.com.ph,2018-10-02T15:57:23Z,Gov't aiming to forge joint oil exploration agreement with China in WPS next month,"By Genalyn Kabiling
The government is aiming to forge a joint oil exploration agreement with China in the West Philippine Sea next month and pave the way for the commercial production by 2027.
In the wake of the soaring world oil prices, Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque said the government must set aside the territorial conflict with China and pursue the oil exploration deal to lessen the country’s dependence on imported oil.
The proposed joint exploration agreement, Roque added, could be signed when Chinese President Xi Jinping visits Manila in November.
“We are doing everything we can to make sure that when President Xi comes here, we can sign the joint exploration na magsimula na tayo maghanap ng natural gas at langis nang sa ganun magkaroon na tayo ng energy security [so we can start looking for natural gas and oil and ensure our energy security],” Roque said during a Palace press briefing.
“Naging malinaw na kinakailangan na po natin isulong ang joint exploration, isantabi ang ating hidwaan dahil according to preliminary studies mayroon laman ang SC 72 at sana po makuha na natin ‘yan at sa ganun hindi na tayo nakadepende sa inaangkat na langis [It is clear that we need to pursue joint exploration, set aside the conflict because preliminary studies showed Service Contract 72 has oil reserves. We hope to get the supply so we won’t depend on imported oil],” he said.
Roque said the government hopes to tap the rich oil resources in the West Philippine Sea before the Malampaya natural gas field in Palawan runs out of supply. He acknowledged that there was no other place in the country that has rich oil reserves except for SC 72 which covers the disputed Reed Bank.
He noted that the Malampaya contract would end in 2022 but the gas field could still supply gas until 2032.
“We’re hoping na around 2027 may commercial production na dyan sa SC 72,” he said.
“As it is, talagang dependent tayo sa foreign crude products. Kapag nawala pa ang malampaya na nagbibigay sa atin ng kuryente, mas malala ang magiging problema natin [As it is, we really depend on foreign crude products. If Malampaya field which gives us electricity, dries up, we will have a bigger problem],” he said.
The government earlier said it was working on a framework for the possible oil exploration with China without hurting the country’s territorial claims. Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano previously assured the public that such framework would abide by the Constitution and follow the Malampaya’s 60-40 sharing of revenues for the Philippines.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Province of Palawan', 'Malampaya Sound']}",investment,"['China', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China']","['China', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese']"
Philippines,13770,inquirer.net,2017-10-10T09:55:44Z,China financing eyed for Agus power plant rehab,"The government is eyeing to secure financing from China to rehabilitate the hydroelectric facility supplying power in Mindanao.
Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III told reporters last week that rehabilitation of the Agus River hydroelectric system will be included in the second basket of six to eight projects to be pitched for Chinese financing.

Dominguez said the facility was operating at only 60 percent capacity.
“Now that we have excess capacity in Mindanao, now is the time to fix that up so that at the time when they have to shut the plugs down for maintenance, we will have the extra capacity there,” Dominguez said.
“I told the Chinese [that Agus rehabilitation] is very important for us because no matter how much infrastructure you have, if you don’t have power it doesn’t work right,” Dominguez added.
The Finance chief said they had yet to determine how much was needed to rehabilitate Agus, as it was “quite a complex” project comprised of six power plants. “We’ll have to do the feasibility study,” he said.
The Philippine and Chinese governments earlier identified the first batch of projects to be funded by China. These included the P4.6-billion Binondo-Intramuros and P1.4-billion Estrella-Pantaleon bridges in Manila, which will be financed by grants; P10.9-billion New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project; and P2.7-billion Chico River Pump Irrigation Project in Cagayan and Kalinga provinces.
Also part of the initial batch of projects were the elevated expressway in Davao City; construction of an industrial park; as well as two drug rehabilitation facilities.
The Chinese government will also finance four more Philippine projects namely: reconstruction of Marawi under a 20-million-renminbi or $3-million donation in kind; Panay-Guimaras-Negros Island bridges; the provisions under the enforcement and security cooperation agreement between Manila and Beijing; and construction of an agriculture technical center.
Earlier the Department of Finance said Philippine and Chinese officials had “also expressed hope that the two sides could reach a consensus on the working level on the second basket of infrastructure projects presented by the Philippines for possible Chinese financing, so that the memoranda of understanding could be finalized on these before their leaders visit Manila next year.” /cbb

Camarines Sur 2nd district Rep. LRay Villafuerte (left) and President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. (Facebook/ MANILA BULLETIN)
According to Villafuerte, President Marcos ""pulled off a coup"" in securing almost $14 billion worth of pledges from renewable energy (RE) investors in his three-day state visit.“The President has walked the talk on decarbonization with his coup in Beijing of hauling in close to $14 billion in investment pledges from Chinese companies, which will give a big boost to our country’s ambitious goal of GHG (greenhouse gas) emission reduction and avoidance,"" the veteran solon said in a statement.Villafuerte, the National Unity Party (NUP) president, said Marcos's push for RE investments to achieve a greener economy and reduce our country’s carbon footprint ""was in sync with his steady pitch in all his foreign trips since he assumed the presidency for climate justice"".He praised the Filipino leader for securing funding support from the world’s affluent economies--which are usually the big GHG emitters--for programs that would help high-risk developing nations like the Philippines shift to cash-intensive RE sources and better adapt to worsening natural disasters set off by planet heating.He said this is significant ""given that no such financial aid for climate justice is apparently coming anytime soon from the world’s biggest GHG emitters or carbon polluters, judging from the agreement—or lack of it—that was reached at the end of last year’s COP27 in Egypt"".Villafuerte was referring to the outcome of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The COP27 summit was held last Nov. 6 to 18 at the resort city of Sharm el-Sheik in Egypt.At the end of that summit, wealthy countries agreed for the first time ever to put up a “loss and damage” fund for vulnerable nations like the Philippines that bear the brunt of climate change, but avoided making firm commitments on how much exactly would be given and when such would be released to the intended beneficiary-countries like the Philippines.COP27 ended with an agreement for country-participants to create a “transitional panel” that would work on the “loss and damage” details in time for formal presentation at COP28, which is due on Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, h in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Villafuerte said.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila'], 'ARE': ['United Arab Emirates', 'Dubai']}",investment,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,26330,inquirer.net,2020-04-06T18:52:11Z,PayMaya developer gets $120M local and international investments,"MANILA, Philippines — One of the country’s leading financial technology platforms raised over P6 billion from local and international investors as the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic bolsters demand for electronic payments.
Voyager Innovations, the technology company behind mobile wallet PayMaya, received fresh funding to the tune of $120 million (P6.1) billion to support its aggressive expansion plans.
ADVERTISEMENT
The money came from existing shareholders PLDT Inc., China’s Tencent as well as KKR and the International Finance Corp. (IFC), both based in the US.
Demand for services such as PayMaya are going up as millions of Filipinos are confined to their homes to halt the spread of COVID-19. Banks have also encouraged clients to use digital options amid a Luzon enhanced community quarantine that has restricted the movement of people.
“This fresh round of investment is a testament to Voyager’s success in providing Filipinos with access to convenient, relevant and inclusive digital financial services through PayMaya,” the companies said in a joint statement on Monday.
“This is also a recognition of the significant role that the Philippine financial technology industry can play in providing meaningful digital solutions to many of the crucial and very-human challenges that the Philippine community faces today,” they added in statement.
The funding comes amid the challenging investment climate in the Philippines and overseas as efforts to contain the outbreak are likely to cause economies around the world to contract.
Voyager plans to use the money to support the growth programs of PayMaya, best known to customers as the smartphone app used to buy goods and services without cash.
PayMaya, whose platform also supports businesses and government agencies, earlier announced a goal of reaching P1 trillion in transaction volume by 2023.
“In line with the country’s goals, we have made significant strides in spurring cashless adoption in a largely unbanked population. This funding boosts PayMaya’s ability to reach more Filipinos, especially as access to digital financial services becomes even more important,” Orlando B. Vea, CEO and Founder of Voyager Innovations, said in the statement.
The funding round adds to the $215 million (P10.9 billion) that Voyager had raised from Tencent, the Chinese technology giant that developed WeChat, KKR and IFC since 2018.

“Today, more than ever, our end-to-end digital financial services are becoming more relevant and embedded in the daily lives of Filipinos – from sending money, buying airtime load, or paying for purchases through our PayMaya wallet,” said Shailesh Baidwan, President of Voyager Innovations and PayMaya Philippines.
PayMaya competes with local players such as GCash, the fintech backed by the Ayala Group and Chinese billionaire Jack Ma.
During the COVID-19 crisis, fintech platforms have also turned into avenues for private sector donations.
PayMaya launched its #OneAgainstCOVID19 in partnership with organizations such as the Philippine Red Cross, UNICEF, Oxfam Pilipinas, UP PGH Medical Foundation, and Caritas Manila. The campaign has so far raised P15.1 million.

GT Capital said in a disclosure to the stock exchange majority shareholders Grand Titan Capital Holdings Inc. and the Ty family sold 8.715 million common shares to foreign and domestic institutional investors at a price of P1,130.00 apiece. The selling price represents a 4.2 percent discount to GT Capital’s closing price of P1,180 on Feb. 2. GT Capital plans to use proceeds from the share sale to finance a rights issue of the company’s banking unit Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co., Federal Land Inc., Toyota Motors Philippines Corp., Global Business Power Corp, AXA Philippines, Charter Ping An Insurance Corp, Toyota Manila Bay Corp. and Toyota Cubao Inc. Metrobank, the country’s second-largest lender, last month announced plans to raise P32 billion from the stock market through a rights offering to boost capital and expand branch network. The bank plans to conduct the rights offering in April this year. Metrobank tapped J.P. Morgan and UBS as joint global coordinators, joint international lead managers and joint book runners, and First Metro Investment Corp. as the sole domestic lead manager and joint bookrunner.l HSBC is acting as co-manager of Metrobank’s rights offering. GT Capital said it might spend P50 billion in capital expenditures this year as the company remains bullish about the economy. The conglomerate also plans to diversify into the transportation and infrastructure sectors.The company earlier expressed interest on two public-private partnership projects of the government, including the LRT Line 2 operation and maintenance contract and Laguna Lakeshore Expressway Dike. The company is also venturing into geothermal and biomass energy power projects. Global Business has committed to install over 1,000 megawatts of power capacity in the next four years with investment of more than $1 billion.

Philippines,10944,manilatimes.net,2016-11-20T23:31:41Z,"PH, China prepare structure for investment pledges","CHINA and the Philippines have set up the structures of coordination to effectively implement the investment pledges forged between Manila and Beijing during President Rodrigo Duterte’s state visit last month.
This development, according to global lenders, is net positive for the Philippine economy.
Credit Suisse viewed the Philippine pivot to China as net positive for the economy and balance of payments starting next year, as “it will help bring in more FDI [foreign direct investments] and tourism from China in 2017 with political drags removed.”
HSBC, on the other hand, noted China is likely to replace the United States as the largest investor in the Philippines.
Of the $24 billion in hard and soft investment commitments from China, HSBC expects $2.5 billion of inflows in 2017 or 0.8 percent of gross domestic product, compared to $200 million in total FDI from Beijing since 2010.
“This should more than offset any reduced investment from the US, but is unlikely to stem the deterioration in the current account, which we expect to halve this year to 1.3 percent of GDP due to the widening goods deficit,” it said.
According to the Department of Finance (DOF), Philippine officials led by Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd, Public Works Secretary Mark Villar and Senator Alan Peter Cayetano met last week with officials of the National Development and Reform Commission of China (NDRC), just days after President Duterte approved the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board’s pre-investment and project guidelines.
“I think this afternoon we have laid the ground work on moving ahead and we should continue this dialogue with specific projects in mind,” Dominguez said at the meeting.
Led by NDRC Deputy Chairman Ning Jizhe, the Chinese officials reiterated Beijing’s full support for President Duterte’s 10-point socioeconomic agenda and their keen interest in investing in, among others, energy, tourism, technology and infrastructure, particularly in the construction of railways and bridges.
The NDRC is China’s main planning and strategy agency.
“We have been informed of the 10-point economic agenda. On our side, we have the One-Road One-Belt Initiative by President Xi Jinping and we hope that both sides can encourage these plans and encourage Chinese business to invest in the Philippines,” Ning said during the meeting.
The Chinese official noted the purpose of their visit was to discuss in detail and implement the various memorandums of understanding (MOUs) signed during President Duterte’s visit, particularly on investment cooperation and transport infrastructure.
“Developing the economy and promoting people’s livelihood will be the foundation of our governments’ cooperation,” Ning said.
In the meeting, Dominguez informed the NDRC delegation that President Duterte, as chairperson of the NEDA Board, has ordered the Investment Coordination Committee to ensure good and close coordination with the NDRC in executing the economic cooperation between the Philippines and China.
The officials agreed to hold an investors conference next year to discuss possible projects, after the Philippine government submits the proposed ventures will benefit the most from Chinese technology and expertise.
To speed up the pre-investment process, Dominguez committed to provide the Chinese embassy with a list of possible projects by December 1.
Describing the MOUs as “good frameworks of cooperation” between the two countries, Ning said his instruction from China was to “bring these MOUs to reality.”
During President Duterte’s state visit, Dominguez signed three agreements on behalf of the Philippines: the Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation giving Manila a 100-million yuan grant to implement anti-illegal drugs and law enforcement security cooperation projects, and the MOU Supporting the Conduct of Feasibility Studies for Major Projects, in which China will provide financing support for feasibility studies on big-ticket infrastructure, agriculture and rural development projects.
The third MOU signed was on Financing Cooperation with the Export-Import Bank of China (China EXIM), which would allow the Philippines to tap China EXIM funds for major projects.
Given China’s impressive achievement in lifting its people out of poverty, Dominguez said he is confident the technologies for energy, irrigation, flood control, and land and sea infrastructure would benefit the Philippines.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila'], 'USA': ['United States']}",investment,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['China', 'CHINA', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,5117,inquirer.net,2014-10-03T05:04:26Z,China Bank hikes stake in venture with Manulife,"MANILA, Philippines–The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has approved the plans of SM group-led China Bank to raise its stake in a bancassurance venture with global insurer Manulife Financial Corp. and infuse P1.59 billion in fresh capital into China Bank Savings.
In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Thursday, China Bank said its board had obtained notice from the BSP approving the bank’s plan to hike its interest in Manulife China Bank Life Assurance Corp. (MCBL) to 40 percent from 5 percent.
ADVERTISEMENT
At the same time, the BSP also approved the additional capital infusion into subsidiary China Bank Savings Inc. to retire debt notes issued by Planters Development Bank—which was acquired by the group early this year.
For the bancassurance venture, China Bank is raising its stake to unlock more values from the growing volume of business from this partnership with Canada-based Manulife.
When China Bank teamed up with Manulife in 2007, the plan was to eventually acquire a larger stake in the firm as the 5-percent initial stake acquired then was the minimum equity ownership requirement imposed by banking regulators for bancassurance operations.
Through this partnership, Manulife can sell insurance to Chinabank clients and the bank could in turn earn fees out of commissions. With a bigger equity stake, China Bank can increase its fee-based earnings.
In the meantime, the disclosure said the fresh capital infusion into China Bank Savings would be used for the early redemption of Planters Development Bank’s subordinated notes amounting to P1.7 billion.
The debt notes carry coupon interest rates of 10.25 percent and 8.75 percent per year and are maturing in 2019 and 2020.–Doris C. Dumlao

China Import Export Bank and the Bank of China, owners of the fund, are extending the assistance to all Asean countries to help them improve their transport industries and eventually showcase the Southeast Asia as as a world leader in maritime trade. Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry chairman emeritus Francis Chua, who is also the fund administrator for the Philippines, said China was extending the financial assistance as a development package. “This is direct investment, not loan. They will bring the money to an existing project that lacks capital. This fund they have is not to make money with. It’s a funding they use to help develop a certain region. For instance the first $1 billion released last year was to help Asean industries. They make sure they are helping make a certain industry grow,” he said. The Philippines received as much as $125 million from the first $1 billion Asean Fund that was used to invest in 2GO Group Inc. of Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc.China is expected to release the fund by the second half of 2015.

(SMIC), said it is in exploratory talks for possible partnership deals with some companies from China and Russia that have expressed plans of entering the Philippine market following President Rodrigo Dutere’s goodwill visits to those countries.Duterte has brought back billions of dollars worth of pledges of investment and loans from the government, companies and banks of China after his state visit.“We are discussing with certain groups, but nothing has been finalized,” SMIC Chief Financial Officer Jose T. Sio said.The Russian and Chinese companies that have shown interest are operating in the same sectors where the SM group has “competitive advantage,” namely property, retail and banking, he said.These investors are very keen on taking advantage of the opportunities in the domestic market, Sio said, although he declined to identify the companies.“There are many opportunities in the Philippines. We have our young educated people -- that is our advantage. We have many things to develop, including infrastructure, airports, mining, etc. There are many opportunities here, and we opened ourselves up to China, Russia and the US,” he said.Given China’s vision to be a world power, it is seen likely to ramp up its investment in emerging markets such as the Philippines. Sio predicts that in about 50 years, China could unseat the US as the leading world power as the US pursues a stance to “close its boundaries” to protect its citizens and give them back their jobs.That creates an “opportunity for another power to lead the world. [For China,] it is a possibility and they have the resources to do it. Not necessarily [lead] the world, but they can lead Asia. Europe is Europe. South America has its own group. In Asia, we should be led by China and Japan,” Sio said.Next bond issueMeanwhile, Sio said SMIC is still “looking for the right time” to issue the next tranches of its P50-billion bond offer program.“We still have P30 billion. Next year, depending on the market, it could be peso- or dollar-[denominated bonds]. That’s why it will depend on the market. If the market is right, we’ll go out [and issue them],” Sio said.Earlier this month, SMIC raised P20 billion from the initial tranche of its P50 billion bond offer under shelf registration. The bonds carry a yield of 5.1590 percent per year and will mature in 2023.Funds raised from its bond program, which can be issued within a span of three years, will go to financing future investments and strategic acquisitions within SMIC’s core businesses in property, retail and banking segments.“We borrow not because we need the funds now. It is not a necessity for us. We borrow because of the opportunity,” Sio said.He said one example of an opportunity is the acquisition of a minority stake in the growing dormitory chain MyTown, which has a transaction value of more than P1 billion.Asked about other acquisition opportunities the group is currently looking at, Sio said: “They are under our core business – the three (property, retail and banking). We have several entities being discussed, but as I said, we are committed to confidentiality. We cannot disclose [that right now.]”SMIC is led by Henry Sy, the richest man in the Philippines.

Philippines,8771,manilastandard.net,2016-06-06T00:00:00Z,Chinese firms eye PH for office space,"Bright lights, big city. Setting up an office in the Philippines, the new gateway to Southeast Asia and beyond, makes sense for a growing number of corporate players in the mainland.
White, sandy beaches have been drawing Chinese tourists to the Philippines in recent years. But beyond the resorts, the nation is stirring – furiously – and becoming ever more attractive to Chinese companies, according to global commercial real estate firm JLL. As Chinese companies look for new growth channels outside of their home markets, overseas expansion is opening doors for nearby markets such as the Philippines, observed P. Ryan Isip, national director at JLL. “Chinese companies not presently in Manila are now opening offices here and all over the place,” he said. “They realise that real estate is an essential dimension of corporate operations; it is important for boosting corporate image, workplace productivity, as well as attracting and retaining talent.“Setting up an office in the Philippines makes sense, given the close proximity to China, and that opportunities for expansion in the market can serve as a gateway to Southeast Asia and more,” added Isip. The sentiment was recently echoed by a Bloomberg report released earlier this year, which named the Philippines as the second-fastest growing market in Asia after China.“Compared to other countries in the region, the Philippines has a relatively large population, which boasts a growing middle-class and an increasingly professional workforce,” said Isip.He added that “the cost of doing business is low, and the country has a very business-friendly environment; this is proven by the huge presence of reputable foreign companies that already operate large back-office functions here.” Tencent and DiDi Chu Xing who are exploring the Philippines, are among the latest Chinese companies to look into setting up operations in Manila, joining the likes of carmakers BAIC and Chery, global communications and telecommunications technology solutions provider Huawei, and China State Construction. “Overseas growth is especially key for successful companies looking to increase their global reach and stay ahead of the competition, and this is especially true in China, where a slowing economy at home is being felt and the implications of this cannot be ignored,” said Steven McCord, head of research for North China at JLL. “Many well-known Chinese brands have thrived in the protected environment of the mainland,” he noted. “But they are now venturing out of the country into more competitive environments backed up by revenues from the past decade.”Meanwhile, Chinese giants like Huawei and appliance manufacturer Haier have seen huge growth in China. “Therefore, to sustain a certain level of growth, these companies are going overseas,” said McCord. “Being so close to the mainland, the Philippines is a logical place to do business, and the presence of Chinese firms is already being felt in office markets both locally and elsewhere in the region.” Moreover, the 2015 list of the top Global Fortune 500 companies included 104 Chinese companies, 51 of which are based in Beijing, indicating that potential demand for Chinese expansion abroad appears healthy. “Under the pressure of a slower economy, Chinese corporates are expanding in the Philippines because they have the ability to do so as part of their diversification,” said Isip. “They can only penetrate so much of their own market, while here they are presented with a new market and new opportunities.Local attitudes should also support more Chinese investment in the country. “Take for example, Chinese goods,” said Isip. “Chinese goods are welcomed in the Philippines, and we see imported goods from China readily gobbled up. As companies set up shop in the Philippines and establish a strong local presence, they will enjoy ready acceptance by the market.” Isip added that the local ethnic Chinese population also plays well into the equation. “There’s already a sizeable ethnic Chinese population here, so, we have an existing population that speaks some dialects of Chinese, and this makes it easier for parts of the community to communicate with people from mainland China,” explained Isip. “On top of that, more tourists from China are flocking to our beaches, and these visits help to introduce more Chinese people to our culture and what we have to offer as a country, which can also be applied in a larger context to the business world.”",1,,,"{'None': ['Southeast Asia', 'Asia'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'Huanghuai Pingyuan']}",investment,"['Tencent', 'Chinese']","['Tencent', 'Chinese']","['Chinese', 'Tencent']","['Tencent', 'China', 'Chinese']"
Philippines,8693,inquirer.net,2016-06-27T04:41:45Z,Duterte to speed up PH entry into AIIB,"INCOMING Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez said the Duterte administration will fast-track the Philippines’ membership in the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to widen financing options in line with plans to ramp up infrastructure development.
“The Duterte administration will definitely pursue joining the AIIB as at the forefront of the incoming administration’s socioeconomic agenda is to increase infrastructure spending in the country to 5 percent of the gross domestic product,” Dominguez, through incoming Department of Finance (DOF) spokesperson Paola Alvarez, told the Inquirer.

“With [heavy vehicular] traffic and the lack of basic infrastructure projects being hindrances to Philippine economic prosperity, the membership of the Philippines to the AIIB, an infrastructure-lending bank, is surely something that the people will benefit from,” Dominguez added.
“Together with India, Indonesia, Singapore, Burma (Myanmar), Mongolia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South Korea, Cambodia as well as Brazil, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Spain already being founding members of the AIIB, the Duterte administration sees no reason why Congress would not ratify the Philippines’ membership to the AIIB,” Dominguez said.
On Dec. 31 last year—only a day before the deadline—the Philippines announced that it will become a founding member of the AIIB, which aims to finance developing countries’ infrastructure needs.
The Philippines’ membership, however, remained pending as it was impossible to secure Senate ratification in the remaining days of the 16th Congress ahead of the elections last May. The country still has until yearend to secure Senate approval in order to become a founding member.
“Rest assured, the DOF will do its part to work closely with the bicameral committees involved in studying the benefits the Philippines will acquire by signing as a member to the AIIB,” according to Dominguez.
Over the weekend, the AIIB convened in Beijing the 2016 annual meeting of its board of directors, which last week approved their first four loans amounting a total of $509 million to finance projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and Tajikistan.
National Treasurer Roberto B. Tan was scheduled to attend the meeting, but only as an observer pending the Philippines’ membership.
To become an AIIB member, the Philippines must shell out $196 million, payable in five years or $39 million (over P1.8 billion) per year, as indicative paid-in capital. Members must pay the initial tranche of their respective contributions before this year ends.

The Anvil Business Club, an organization of young Filipino-Chinese entrepreneurs, held its 4th Anvil Exchange Forum at the Makati Diamond Hotel.
More than 120 Anvil members and guests attended the event, with investment banker Stephen CuUnjieng as the guest speaker.
CuUnjieng underscored the pressing need for the Philippines to prioritize industrialization as a key driver of economic growth.
He pointed to successful nations that have leveraged manufacturing and industrialization to fuel their developments.
“The ‘leave it to the private sector’ attitude, coupled with a lack of manufacturing and long-term planning, has resulted in a high vulnerability to imported inflation. This situation leaves countries like the Philippines disproportionately exposed to price fluctuations in imported goods, stemming from a heavy reliance on foreign markets.” he said.
CuUnjieng noted the crucial importance of adding value through refining and processing mineral resources for maximum economic gain, particularly in the context of exporting higher-value finished goods.
He said the Philippines’ limited manufacturing capacity made it particularly vulnerable to the economic impacts of the pandemic. With a smaller manufacturing sector compared to other nations, the country struggled more with the downturn.
He also underscored the need to develop the Philippines’ manufacturing sector to enhance resilience against future global crises, reduce import dependence, stimulate economic growth and create jobs.
He also discussed the structural issues affecting the Philippines’ economic performance, focusing on inadequate and costly infrastructure.
He cited the need for cost-effective infrastructure to drive national development.
CuUnjieng criticized the private sector’s profit-driven approach, stating that while profit is important, it shouldn’t be the sole focus of infrastructure projects.
“In reimagining infrastructure development in the Philippines, we must prioritize the long-term benefits to the economy and society over short-term gains,” he said.",0,,,"{'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Makati City']}",investment,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese']

Philippines,23069,inquirer.net,2019-12-18T04:05:00Z,Lucio Tan-Chinese firm team likely to bag Sangley airport JV project,"A Chinese state-owned company and taipan Lucio Tan, owner of Philippine Airlines, have forged an alliance to transform a former Air Force base in Sangley Point, Cavite, into an international gateway to decongest Manila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia).
China Communications Construction Co. Ltd. (CCCC), one of the country’s biggest infrastructure firms, and partner MacroAsia Corp., a publicly-listed aviation services firm owned by Tan, were the sole bidders for the Cavite government’s P500-billion Sangley Point International Airport.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Upon perusal of their submission, their joint venture proposal was deemed complete, subject to detailed evaluation by the PPP (Public Private Partnership) selection committee,” Jesse Grepo, legal officer and secretary of the committee, said in a text message as the bid was opened Tuesday.
Five other potential bidders, including Manuel V. Pangilinan’s Metro Pacific Investments Corp. and Manuel Villar Jr.’s Prime Asset Ventures, did not submit proposals.
With no challengers, the CCCC-MacroAsia consortium is poised to win the project, which was structured as a venture with the local government unit, meaning it will not need the approval of agencies such as the National Economic and Development Authority to proceed.
Grepo said the review would likely last through next year with a potential awarding date on Jan. 15, 2020. A ceremonial ground breaking could also happen on the same month, should the consortium meet all technical and financial requirements.
MacroAsia officials did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.
The Sangley Point International Airport is the Cavite government’s response to congestion in Naia, which is located at a straight line distance of about 11-kilometers away.
It will require the reclamation of over 1,400 hectares of land around the current Danilo Atienza Air Base, as the existing Sangley Airport is called.
Eventually, the facility will be transformed into a massive air hub with four runways and terminals capable of handling 100 million passengers annually— three times the design limits of Naia.
The Sangley Point International Airport has also drawn criticism given its close association with the Chinese government. In its project study, which was seen by the Inquirer, the airport plan was described to be aligned with China’s One Belt, One Road cross-border infrastructure plan.

“We see no problems with regard to national security,” Grepo said. He added that the project contained no sovereign guarantees and the offer on the table has a local partner, MacroAsia.
Some experts also believed Sangley’s proximity to Naia meant certain limitations for simultaneous operations.
In the Sangley project study, it was recommended that Naia should focus operations on its main international runway. It acknowledged that some of its existing approach and departure airspace routes “overlap with the airspace required for similar key structures” at the Sangley Airport.
CCCC-MacroAsia was among seven groups that formally expressed interest in bidding by acquiring joint venture documents, which were issued last Oct. 11.
The other companies were Metro Pacific, Prime Asset Ventures and Philippine Airport Ground Support Solutions Inc. led by businessman Jefferson Cheng. The two other entities were Langham Properties Inc. and Mosveldtt Law Offices.
Some of the bidders sought more time but requests were turned down by the Cavite government, which extended the first deadline on Nov. 25 to Dec. 17 this year.
Earlier, the Cavite government said the first phase of the project could be opened as early as 2022 with a capacity of 25 million passengers annually.
The current Sangley Airport is being readied by the Department of Transportation to handle general aviation and turboprop operations. The airport now has a 2,400-meter runway, a terminal for 160 passengers and an apron that can accommodate up to five turboprop planes.
The DOTr expects to be reimbursed for costs it incurred should the Cavite government’s plan push through, Transportation secretary Arthur Tugade earlier said.
The Sangley Point International Airport is part of the DOTr’s so-called multi-airport strategy to address congestion in Manila and nearby provinces.
Other gateways in the pipeline include San Miguel Corp.’s New Manila International Airport in Bulacan province and the Clark International Airport in Pampanga province.

Just last week, the Palace defended the country’s 20-year loan deal with China to finance the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project. Critics said the deal with Beijing was “onerous” in its entirety and had a “dangerous component” that highly favored Beijing. But Panelo said the economic team had studied the matter at length and ignored the concerns over the deal. The Department of Finance says the Philippines has already executed nine loan agreements with other countries, two of which are from China.",1,,,"{'None': ['Asia'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Chico River'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'MYS': ['Malaysia']}",economic_aid_assistance,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Beijing']"

Philippines,24052,mb.com.ph,2020-01-18T00:00:00Z,Batangas gov’t seeking assistance from China to help in rehab after Taal eruption – Manila Bulletin,"By Aaron Recuenco
BATANGAS CITY— The provincial government of Batangas is seeking assistance from China, through a grant or a soft loan, for the recovery and rehabilitation of the areas severely damaged by the eruption of Taal Volcano.
In a letter dated January 17 and addressed to Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian, Batangas Governor Hermilando Mandanas said the assistance would also include several projects which he described as essential in ‘strengthening development strategies’ of the province.
“In order to boost our efforts in recovery and rehabilitation against the damage and onslaught ofd the eruption, we would like to secure assistance for a grant or a soft loan relative to projects which are directed towards strengthening our development strategies,” said Mandanas in the letter.
The projects include establishment and operation of a provincial port, the Batangas Access Zone in the eastern and western side of the province, Batangas Airport, Batangas Railway Project and the Batangas Housing Project.
In enumerating the development projects, Mandanas cited that Batangas was part of the One Belt, One Road Initiative of China.
China’s Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious project aimed at connecting countries of the world through mega-projects that focuses on shipping lanes, railroads and airports.
The goal is to build a trade and infrastructure network to realize China’s plan of reviving the ancient Silk Road trade route. The Philippines has been supportive of the Belt and Road Initiative and in fact signed a Memorandum of Understanding of China in 2018.
“…this is an opportune time to manifest the close relationship between China and the Philippines through the Province of Batangas and the CALABARZON (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon) region,” the letter signed by Mandanas read.
The letter came after the Chinese Ambassador visited the evacuees at the Batangas Sports Complex.
“Not only will this be an immediate response and mitigation effort, but we are now already rehabilitating and advancing our projects as part of our recovery and development program, hopefully with the assistance from the People’s Republic of China,” the letter read.
Rehab cost
It is not immediately clear how much money Batangas would need although experts said that the province could need at least P100 billion for the rehabilitation efforts of the areas which were devastated by the Taal Volcano eruption.
As of 5 a.m. Saturday, the Batangas Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) reported that the damage to agriculture alone has reached more than P311 million.
At least P93 million was initially assessed as damage to bridges in heavily affected areas due to ashfall and fissures from magma activity of the Taal Volcano.
Aside from infrastructure projects, at least 617 houses were also reported to have been totally damaged as a result of the thick ashfall. The report from Balate town was only initial as only one house was listed in the roster of residences that was damaged.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Calabarzon', 'Batangas', 'Manila', 'Cavite', 'Quezon', 'Province of Laguna']}",economic_aid_assistance,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

The decision to return to Australia, some 2,000 km (1,240 miles) away was made despite being cleared by air traffic control to land and comes amid increasing rivalry between Australia’s and China’s aid programmes in the Pacific.
A plane from China, carrying medical equipment donated by Guangdong province to fight the coronavirus, had landed at the airport in Port Vila on Saturday.
“The Chinese plane was at one end of the runway. There was still 2,000 metres of runway available,” Jason Rakau, chief executive of Airports Vanuatu, told Reuters.
“We gave clearance to land. They were circling.”
A spokesman for Australian defence minister Linda Reynolds did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

An RAAF plane did arrive on Monday, delivering relief supplies, including shelter kits, blankets and solar lanterns, as part of a A$4 million ($2.6 million) relief package, Australia’s High Commission to Vanuatu said in a statement.
Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, an Australian foreign policy think tank, said the airport incident was “bizarre”.
“Coordination is critical. When you’re both trying to help, even if you’re not going to work together, at least don’t get in each other’s way,” Pryke told Reuters.
“The good news is the supplies from Australia did get there, just a tad later.”
Tropical Cyclone Harold made landfall on April 6, destroying over 1,000 schools and 90% of homes in the worst-hit area of Sanma, the United Nations said. Local media reported two people were killed.

“The Embassy is happy to learn that the above-mentioned rice has been allocated by the relevant local government units to families most adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as a major part of the family food packs, benefiting about 500,000 Filipino families,” it said.

In a statement, the Chinese Embassy in Manila said the aid package includes a P50 million donation from the mission, another P35 million “committed” by the Chinese government, and about P4.8 million ($100,000) from the Red Cross Society of China.

China is among the first nations to announce aid for the country in the wake of the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year, which killed at least 15 and destroyed millions of pesos worth of crops, infrastructure and property in northern Luzon.
“As a friend, a good neighbor and brothers, it is our duty and responsibility to provide assistance to the victims of typhoon,” Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua told President Duterte as they shook hands during brief turnover rites in Malacañang on Monday.
Mr. Duterte, who just came from a state visit to China last week, expressed his gratitude to the envoy, noting that the donation came with no conditions.
“This will go a long way to rehabilitate and return the people, our countrymen to the normal life. For our country, it will surely go a long way,” he said.
“But these are the amounts that the Chinese government has given us by way of help. By the way, no strings attached. It’s completely out of benevolence,” said the President, who has repeatedly expressed his intent to deepen ties with China while deviating from the country’s traditional alliance with the United States.
The Chinese aid represents a raise from Beijing’s humanitarian allocation for the Philippines in the wake of the 2013 monster storm Yolanda (international name: Haiyan), for which it initially offered $100,000 (less than P5 million) just as aid flooded from around the world.
This drew flak at the time, its aid described in the international media as “measly” and “paltry” when compared even to corporate donations.
It later raised support by providing nearly $1.7 million (about P76 million) worth of tents, blankets and other goods, and sent its hospital ship to the Philippines two weeks after Yolanda hit.
Political analyst Richard Heydarian said China’s immediate and increased humanitarian support for the Philippines is “definitely a reflection of the rapprochement between the Philippines and China.”

Philippines,19975,mb.com.ph,2019-03-28T14:39:29Z,China offers help to improve lives of Filipinos,"By Genalyn Kabiling
China has offered assistance to the Philippines to improve the lives of Filipinos amid the vibrant relations between the two countries.
Visiting Chinese Minister Song Tao relayed the assurance to President Duterte after the chief executive denied any involvement in a complaint filed against Chinese President Xi Jinping before the International Criminal Court (ICC)
“If there will be a need of assistance in improving the people’s lives, China is willing to help,” Song told the President during their meeting last Wednesday as stated in a Palace press statement.
The President met with Song, minister of the International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and other Chinese diplomats in Davao City last Wednesday and tackled issues including the South China Sea dispute. The private meeting was disclosed by the Palace to the public Thursday.
In the same meeting, the President told Song that the government had nothing to do with the ICC complaint against Xi but it could not prevent anyone from pursuing such move.
“President Duterte also clarified the case filed by former Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales and former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario against Chinese President Xi Jinping before the International Criminal Court, noting that the administration had no participation in such activity,” the Palace press statement read.
“However, he said, the Philippines is a democratic country. Therefore, ‘we cannot stop people from just filing cases,'” the Palace added.
The two former administration officials recently lodged a complaint against Xi before the ICC for alleged crimes against humanity for his country’s actions in the South China Sea. They complained about China’s encroachment in islands in the South China Sea has resulted in environmentally destructive and illegal reclamations and artificial island building activities.
In the meeting with Song, the President thanked the Chinese government for the “vibrant trade relationship” between the two countries.
“He underscored the relentless support of the Chinese government to the Build Build Build Program of the Duterte administration to beef up the nation’s infrastructure development,” the Palace said.
Duterte and the Chinese minister also discussed “issues that would further strengthen the relationship between the two countries,” according to the Palace. They also tackled “matters of mutual interest, especially on the subject of the South China Sea/ West Philippine Sea.”
“I would like to welcome you warmly, and I’d like to tell you that we are very happy with your visit,” the President told Song.
The Chinese minister also supposedly told Duterte that they were looking forward to his visit to China next month.
Duterte is expected to attend the 2nd Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing late April upon the invitation of Xi. It will be Duterte’s fourth visit to China since he assumed office in 2016 amid improving bilateral ties despite a dispute in the South China Sea.
The Chinese minister was accompanied by Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua, Chinese Consul General to Davao Li Lin and other officials of the IDCPC.

The assistance, he said, is from the Red Cross Society of China. “Wang Yi expressed that China stands ready to actively provide assistance to the Philippines,” he said. Geng made the assurance after Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo asked for cash donations from International communities to buy water for residents of Surigao City and four neighboring municipalities where water supply had been shut down.Taguiwalo said the repairs to the water system might take a while and that her department must prepare for contingency plan to make sure the people in Surigao would have a clean water to drink.

Philippines,3241,manilatimes.net,2013-11-14T14:35:03Z,China to step up aid to Philippines amid controversy,"BEIJING - China is to increase its aid to the typhoon-pummelled Philippines, officials said after criticism of its initial modest response, but some Chinese web users called Thursday for it not to help at all.
The two countries are embroiled in a long-standing row over islands in the strategically vital South China Sea -- which Beijing claims almost in its entirety.
Manila accuses Beijing of asserting its claims increasingly aggressively and says Chinese vessels have occupied the Scarborough Shoal, which it claims itself, since last year.
China -- the world's second-largest economy -- announced a $100,000 cash donation on Monday, with a matching one from the Chinese Red Cross, far less than other countries and a move that prompted criticism overseas.
The US magazine Time carried a report Wednesday under the headline ""The world's second largest economy off-loads insultingly small change on a storm-battered Philippines"".
""The Chinese government has been made to look mean-spirited in front of the world community,"" said the article.
The Chinese embassy in the Philippines said China will provide an additional 10 million yuan ($1.6 million) for relief efforts in the form of blankets, tents and other materials.
""All the materials are now under preparation and will be delivered to the Philippine government as soon as possible,"" it said in a statement on its website that was available only in English.
Chinese media and Internet users -- many of whom are intensely nationalistic -- were divided on how the country should respond to the disaster in the Philippines.
""If (the Chinese government) was generous to the Philippines, it would hurt the Chinese people completely,"" wrote a user with the online handle Old Beijing on Sina Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter.
Another user said: ""I think what China has done was rational -- facts have long showed the wickedness of the Philippine regime. It will not be grateful if we hand them much money. Instead, it could use the cash to buy weapons from the US to attack us.""
But some commentators warned that it was not in China's best interest to water down its humanitarian aid.
""A country's status on the world stage does not only rely on its economic and military strength. It is also determined by how much soft power it can master, which includes its approach to humanitarianism,"" said a commentary in the state-run Global Times Thursday.

“The Chinese Government has committed RMB 5 million (equaling 35 million pesos) to the Philippine anti-disaster efforts. On October 24, the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines donated an aid of 50 million Pesos to the Philippine Government, for the disaster relief of farmers and fishermen in the affected regions,” the statement read.
“The Red Cross Society of China will also provide a humanitarian aid of USD 100,000 to the Philippines. Up to now, the overall amount of aid from the Chinese side is about 90 million pesos,” the embassy said.
The embassy also released photos of President Rodrigo Duterte and Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua shaking hands in Malacañang Palace.
The embassy said Chinese President Xi Jinping had expressed sympathy to Duterte for Lawin’s devastation during their bilateral talks in Beijing last week.
“The Chinese side is confident that under the leadership of President Duterte, people in the stricken areas will overcome the calamity and return to their normal work and lives as soon as possible,” the statement added.
Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo previously said the government was not soliciting foreign aid for typhoon victims because it has sufficient funds to address their needs, but later clarified that the Philippines still welcomes unconditional assistance and donations from other countries.

Philippines,25920,inquirer.net,2020-03-25T14:48:49Z,"PH eyes up to $2 billion loans, grants to combat COVID-19 toll on jobs, health care","MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine government plans to secure up to $2 billion (almost P102 billion) in loans and grants from multilateral lenders so it can dole out aid to workers who lost their jobs while beefing up the health sector, as well as the economy’s defenses against the COVID-19 pandemic, President Duterte’s chief economic manager, said Wednesday.
“We are currently in negotiations with multilateral agencies for $1 billion up to $2 billion in funding support for [COVID-19 response]. We have to realize—we are looking at a drop in revenues. So we have to cover that gap somehow so that we maintain our pace of spending. So we are talking to multilateral agencies at the moment to do that. We want to do it early because all the countries in the world are trying to do the same thing. I think we are a step ahead of the others at this point,” Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said in an interview via Google Meet.
ADVERTISEMENT
Dominguez said the Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Washington-based World Bank, and the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) will be tapped for loans and grants.
“They are also on skeletal force, but we are continuously working online with them. I believe that they see immediate need, and are also working fast,” Dominguez said.
The ADB earlier made available an initial $6.5-billion “rescue” package to its developing member-countries, including the Philippines. The World Bank, meanwhile, had jacked up its “fast-track” financing package for COVID-19 to $14 billion.
The Philippines already secured a commitment from the World Bank to disburse a $100-million loan for the Department of Health (DOH), on top of a $3-million grant from the ADB to buy medical supplies and equipment.
The country was also in “continuous talks” with its bilateral development partners, but Dominguez pointed out that “they, too, are in lockdowns to one extent or the other, and they are also trying to address their domestic situations.”
Dominguez said the additional funds will be specifically spent to “support the people who have lost their livelihoods, and to increase our capacity to combat the virus and protect our front-liners.”
About P200 billion will be given away to displaced workers during the next two months under the emergency bill approved by President Duterte last Monday.
The Department of Labor and Employment (Dole) had said over 111,000 workers were affected by temporary stoppage and flexible work arrangements to date.
In a separate interview with Bloomberg Television, Dominguez said the Philippines was “going to tap all markets” for its commercial borrowings to ramp up financing for COVID-19 response.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Depends on how long it [the pandemic] will last but we are prepared, very well prepared to increase our debt levels,” Dominguez said.
“We have reduced our debt levels from over 70 percent of GDP [gross domestic product] to only 41 percent of GDP now. So we are in a very good position to combat this coronavirus, and we have the debt capacity to do that,” the Finance chief added.
Later asked how much higher the Philippines could afford its debt-to-GDP ratio to rise since economic growth, as a base, will also be impacted, Dominguez replied: “We are willing to do as much as it takes, but this point I don’t have the exact number.”
The state planning agency National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) had projected GDP growth to slow to 4.3 percent or even contract by 0.6 percent this year, depending on interventions to arrest the impact of COVID-19.
Higher borrowings will also offset the estimated foregone tax revenues as COVID-19 took its toll on businesses and livelihood, which Dominguez said would reach P286.4 billion if the Philippine economy posted zero growth this year, or a higher P318.9 billion if GDP contracted by 1 percent.
In the case of fuel, Dominguez said revenue collections were expected to be slashed by P14 billion as both global demand and prices drop.
Given expectations of lower revenues even as the government will still spend all of its P4.1-trillion national budget for 2020, Dominguez said the budget deficit could balloon to “a little more than 4 percent” of GDP, which he deemed as still “reasonable” although wider than the programmed 3.2 percent of GDP for 2020.
“We would most likely realign some items, but we will still keep on the ‘Build, Build, Build’—that is our primary engine of growth,” Dominguez said, referring to the Duterte administration’s ambitious infrastructure program.
While a much wider budget deficit may not augur well to the Philippines’ plan to secure “A” credit ratings within the next two years, Dominguez told Bloomberg Television: “We understand the concerns of the credit rating agencies, but again I suppose we are not the only ones in this boat. I think practically the whole world is facing the same problems that we do.”
“Our main concern now is no longer the credit rating agencies’ opinion of us, but the survival of our people—the support to those whose livelihood are affected, and, of course, supporting our general economy to be ready for the inevitable return to normalcy,” Dominguez added.
“We are like in a battle. In the first part of the battle, we must take care of the essentials, and then as the battle develops we will take a look at the damage to the economy. And therefore that’s the time when we will plan on what we are going to do for the stimulus program. But now, I think we are still in the assessment stage. We don’t know exactly the total damage, but there is damage. So we’ll attend to the immediate emergency, which is to provide livelihood, to provide safety equipment and to do a general support to the economy,” Dominguez said.

Since its introduction in 2013, China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative has been translated from an idea into action, becoming the world’s largest platform for international cooperation. The Belt and Road initiative was officially launched in 2013 when President Xi called for the creation of a “Silk Road Economic Belt” and later expanded to include the so-called 21st Maritime Silk Road. Under the initiative, China aims to boost trade and stimulate economic growth across Asia and beyond, by building massive amounts of infrastructure connecting it to countries around the globe. China plans to pump $150 billion annually to bankroll various infrastructure projects along the ancient Silk Road route. Meng admitted that problems and challenges, even mistrust and misunderstanding, are bound to arise in promoting the Belt and Road Initiative. “The Belt and Road Initiative, though being a Chinese creation, is not a solo performed by China alone, rather, it is a symphony played by all parties involved. Every country is an equal participant, contributor and beneficiary of this important global public good,” he said. “In promoting this initiative, China will share its development experience with the world without reservation; China will not interfere in other’s internal affairs; will not export its social system and development model; will not impose its own will on others,” Meng added.From 2014 to 2016, total trade between China and countries along the Belt and Road as surpassed 3 trillion US dollars, and China’s accumulative investment in these countries surpassed 50 billion US dollars, helping create 180,000 jobs in these countries. “Chinese and Philippines economies are highly complementary. There is great potential in China-Philippines cooperation. We are very happy to see that, in the past year, led and promoted high-level exchanges between the two countries, the mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the Philippines has been accelerating, generating a number of important outcomes,” he said. “Major progress has been made in the first batch of infrastructure projects; the second batch is well under way,” Meng noted. He also cited that from January to November last year, China imported 13,000 batches of tropical fruits from the Philippines; 14 air routes were added between the two countries, while over a million Chinese people visited the Philippines as tourists. “From January to October (in 2017), bilateral trade reached 41.5 billion US dollar, an increase of 8.2 %, making China the largest trading partner of the Philippines,” Meng said. Meng, along with other CPC officials, visited the country upon the invitation of PDP-Laban chaired by President Rodrigo Duterte himself. Meng gave the PDP-Laban members a thematic briefing on the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China last October in Beijing, as part of its bilateral and party-to-party relations with PDP-Laban where he highlighted the latest updates in China and of the CPC since the party congress.",1,,,"{'None': ['Asia'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila']}",economic_aid_assistance,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']
Philippines,3213,manilastandard.net,2013-11-23T00:01:00Z,"China Red Cross ready, too","The Chinese Red Cross has asked to be invited to the Philippines and a senior official said the organization was prepared to support the rehabilitation and rebuilding of areas hit by a powerful typhoon early this month. 

Baige Zhao, Vice President of the Chinese Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said a formal invitation from the Philippines was a requirement that must be met before they will provide assistance to the country.

“We need an invitation from a receiving country like the Philippines at this time. That is the principle and standard,” she said. 

Shortly after super Typhoon Yolanda struck the Visayas region last November 8, the Chinese Red Cross matched the $100,000 donation of the Chinese government. They sent a team of 30 professionals to the affected areas to assess how they can provide assistance. 

The Chinese government sent its 10,000-ton ship The Peace Ark Hospital, which was carrying P73 million worth of relief goods, including tents and blankets. More than 80 Chinese doctors and nurses were also on their way to the affected areas.

Zhao said that based on what she read in newspapers the Philippines welcomed the assistance from China and “we feel they are very supportive. I see the attitude.”

She said the Chinese people were no stranger to natural disasters and “was very sympathetic to the Filipinos because “it’s a humanity issue... being human beings. People love each other. They want to help each other.”

Zhao said the Philippines can learn from Chinese experience during the 2008 earthquake that hit Sichuan in which 80,000 people were killed, mostly those who lived at the foot of the mountains of Sichuan province.

During the 2008 earthquake, rescuers focused on distribution of relief goods and the Chinese military ensured that there were no dead bodies that remained under the rubbles, Zhao said. 

She said China coped with the disaster by acting “very, very fast,” the community was immediately organized to help one another, and the assistance from the international communty was warmly welcomed.

The government needed to act swiftly in the face of the calamity because lack of food, shelter and potable water will lead to chaos and instability, Zhao said.

Philippines,5817,inquirer.net,2015-04-22T04:37:00Z,Gov’t rules out backchanneling talks in sea dispute with China,"MANILA, Philippines–The government ruled out backchanneling talks with China over the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea) territorial dispute, and would instead bank on leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to “speak with one voice” on the issue when the group meets for a summit in Malaysia next week.
The Philippine statement on the dispute has more to do with “Asean centrality,” Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) spokesperson and Assistant Secretary Charles Jose said, explaining that “Asean should be able to speak with one voice.”
ADVERTISEMENT
At the same time, the DFA on Tuesday backed the call of lawmakers for Malacañang to convene the National Security Council (NSC), given China’s continued aggression in disputed waters.
Jose said “convening the NSC would support the position of a whole government approach,” since the dispute was a “complex and pressing issue with far-reaching implications on the country’s economy.”
At a news briefing, Jose said the DFA would pursue appropriate action once it gets hold of the official report on the latest incident of Chinese harassment of Filipino fishermen. On April 9, a Chinese vessel fired water cannons at a group of Filipino fishermen at Panatag Shoal (Scarborough Shoal) in Zambales.
Two tracks
Asked if the government was open to hold backchanneling talks with China over the issue, Jose said the government was engaged in two tracks—diplomatic and legal—in dealing with the dispute.
The “diplomatic track” meant working closely with Asean for the full implementation of the Asean-China 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea or DOC, and the completion of a Code of Conduct.
By “legal,” Jose said this meant Manila’s arbitration case against Beijing before the United Nations tribunal.
It was because of this arbitration case that the country can’t hold backchanneling talks with China, the DFA official said.
“We don’t want to jeopardize our arbitration case by holding bilateral talks,” Jose explained.
ADVERTISEMENT
International attention
But the arbitration case will not stop the Philippines from going to the Asean, as China’s massive reclamation activities in the disputed waters violated the 2002 Asean-China DOC, he said, adding that the South China Sea would be a “priority agenda” for the Philippines in next week’s Asean summit.
Jose said the DFA was able to “generate international attention” in the one year that it raised the alarm on China’s reclamation activities and called the attention of the international community on this development.
Group of 7
Manila was also able to get statements of concern from the Group of 7 industrialized countries, as well as US President Barack Obama, the official added.
At the last Asean foreign ministers’ meeting, a statement on China’s reclamation work was also included, Jose said.
“China’s reclamation activities (are) a very serious matter, a matter of great concern for countries, other claimant countries, the region and the international community … because (they) undermine peace and stability. (They) raise tension and cause massive and irreparable damage, a violation of the 2002 Asean-China DOC,” Jose said.
“It’s very clear it is intended to change the status quo and this could adversely affect our arbitration case,” he added.

Philippines,24013,mb.com.ph,2020-01-11T00:00:00Z,Solon berates PCG commandant for plans to welcome Chinese coast guard in PH visit – Manila Bulletin,"By Charissa Luci-Atienza
Cagayan de Oro Rep. Rufus Rodriguez berated on Saturday, January 11 Admiral Joel Garcia for saying that the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) will welcome a visiting Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) ship next week out of “diplomatic reciprocity”.
He said the PCG Commandant should be investigated for making such “irresponsible and insensitive” statement.
“What diplomatic reprocity is Admiral Joel Garcia talking about? The PCG Commandant is grossly incorrect and rather blind in welcoming a Chinese Coast Guard when it arrives Manila,” Rodriguez told the Manila Bulletin in a text message.
In a televised press briefing, Garcia said the CCG vessel will be welcomed when it embarks on a five-day goodwill visit starting on Monday, January 13.
Rodriguez, chairman of the House Committee on Constitutional Amendments, explained that the Philippines cannot welcome the CCG, citing the several cases of Filipino vessels being harassed and intimidated by CCG ships in the West Philippine Sea.
“The CCG was the direct instrument of the Chinese government in harrassing and intimidating our fishermen in our own Exclusive Economic Zone at Panatag Shoal in the West Philippine Sea,” he said.
“It was also the CCG which blocked Filipino vessels in our resupply mission to Phil Navy’s BRP Sierra Madre at Ayungin Shoal,” he added.
The House leader also noted that the CCG also “shadows and monitors” the Philppine Navy in the West Philippine Sea.
“No. The CCG is not welcome here,” he said.
Rodriguez said he will urge his colleagues to probe Garcia for making such remarks.
“I will file a Resolution in the House to investigate Admiral Garcia for his irresponsible and insensitive statements on rolling the red carpet to welcome the CCG, the oppressors of our fishermen and which disrespects our Navy,” he said.
Garcia had clarified that a “red carpet” treatment will not be accorded to the CCG vessel.
He said the Chinese vessel’s goodwill visit next week would be a good opportunity for the two coast guards to tackle and sort out issues hounding them. It was noted that this would be the third meeting between PCG and CCG as provided under the memorandum of agreement between Manila and Beijing, which was signed in 2017.
He noted the CCG’s port visit has the blessing of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).
Garcia said the CCG’s request to undertake a port visit manifested the China’s “diplomatic effort to deescalate the tension” in the West Philippine Sea.",1,,,"{'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Scarborough Shoal'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing']}",security_cooperation,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese']

“So let us go for alliances that would contribute to the health, to the education—kung aabot pa tayo ng—if there is a world waiting for our children,” he said.
Duterte is set to visit China on Oct. 18-21. He earlier said that during his visit, he would strengthen the bilateral ties between the Philippines and China and would not dwell on the issue of maritime dispute.
In his speech, the President also said he would go to Russia but did not give details of his planned visit.

In a statement Thursday, DOLE said Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III has written letters to the three countries’ ambassadors in the Philippines to ask for assistance in the search and rescue operations for the missing crew.

Gulf Livestock 1 which went missing and reported to have capsized last September 3 in the East China Sea on its way to China from New Zealand due to Typhoon Maysak, carried 43 crew members — 39 of whom are from the Philippines, two from New Zealand, and two from Australia.
The Japanese Coast Guard has so far rescued two Filipinos while the body of another Filipino was retrieved.
The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier said Japanese rescuers have decided to transition from a “full-time” search operations to its usual sea patrol as no trace of the sunken Panamanian-flagged vessel has been found since September 5.
“Don’t give up on your loved ones because there’s really hope. Three foreign governments are helping us find them,” Bello told the families of the missing Filipino sailors in a meeting in Manila Wednesday afternoon.
During the said meeting, Bello informed the relatives of the “renewed search and rescue operations being conducted by the states of China, Taiwan, and South Korea,” according to DOLE.
Envoys’ reply
Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian, in his reply to Bello’s letter, said China “has already commenced rescue operations.”
“Rest assured that we will continue to provide necessary assistance as requested by the Philippine side,” Huang was quoted as saying in DOLE’s statement.
Meanwhile, DOLE said Taiwan’s Ambassador Peiyung Hsu told Bello that the latter’s request has immediately been conveyed to the Taiwan Coast Guard (TCG).
“TCG has already conducted search and rescue operations within the waters in Taiwan’s Area of Responsibility. Rest assured that your good office will be kept posted on any findings or developments of the said operations,” Hsu said.

Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. on Wednesday urged our country’s government anew to engage in bilateral talks with China amid tensions in the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea).
“In my opinion, and this has been my stand ever since, we should talk to China and tell them what we want and that we are not in favor of what they are doing and start from there. What is important is we start a dialogue,” he said in a statement.

Marcos had repeatedly pushed for bilateral talks with China in the past and suggested that it is not necessary to be formal.
“It may be government to government or informal. It may also be through business, our businessmen can help or we may start a cultural or educational exchange,” he said.
For instance, the son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. said that the tensions between the United States and China in the 1970s ended through a game of ping-pong.
“No one thought that the diplomatic tension could end through a game of ping-ping. So all peaceful methods should be pursued, formally or informally, government to government, private sector, educational sector, cultural, sports. Let’s all give it a try. We would not know if it will work unless we give it a try,” he said.
Marcos’ statement comes amid fresh reports of China taking over a Philippine-claimed atoll in the Spratlys. Quirino Atoll was reportedly surrounded by Chinese ships and has kept out local fishermen from going there.

The senator said that the government need not pin its efforts on the upcoming ruling of the arbitration court over the sea row because China had refused to participate in it.
“It is important that we hold talks. We may not be able to do it in one sitting, the process may be long but what is important is we start the dialogue. It is the only way,” he said.

Marcos cited the Philippine-Indonesia maritime baseline agreement as a guide “to lessen the pressure.”
“The valuable experience we had in conducting years of negotiation with Indonesia provides us with a roadmap on how to resolve our maritime territorial dispute with other countries, particularly the one with China in the West Philippine Sea,” he said.
The agreement was signed in 2014 during the state visit of His Excellency Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Such was a result of 20 years of negotiation to delimit the overlapping exclusive economic zone of the two countries. RAM

MAKING FRIENDS President Rodrigo Duterte (left) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. MALACAÑANG PHOTO
BEIJING: President Rodrigo Duterte and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping witnessed the signing of a maritime cooperation agreement and 12 other deals, pledging to enhance trust and deepen cooperation Thursday as Manila seeks to rebalance its foreign policy away from the US.
China welcomed Duterte – who donned a suit and tie for the occasion – with an official ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square, with the two leaders striding side-by-side down the red carpet inspecting an honor guard, with children cheering.
Xi called the two countries “neighbors across the sea,” the official Xinhua news agency said.
Duterte is in China for a four-day trip seen as confirming his tilt away from Washington and towards Beijing’s sphere of influence – and its deep pockets.
The two leaders held “extensive” and “amicable” official talks and oversaw the signing of bilateral cooperation documents on business, infrastructure, and agriculture, among other fields, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, without giving details.
In a statement, the foreign ministry quoted Xi as telling Duterte their emotional foundation of friendly and good neighborliness was unchanged, and difficult topics of discussion “could be shelved temporarily.”
Duterte called the meeting “historic,” it added.
Maritime deal
It was unclear whether the Memorandum on Understanding (MOU) on the Establishment of a Joint Coastal Guard Committee on Maritime Cooperation would involve joint patrols in the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea), which is being contested by the two countries.
Asked whether the leaders had discussed the South China Sea, the foreign ministry’s Hua said they had a “candid and friendly exchange of views on how to resolve relevant disputes.”
Their meeting represented a “return to the right track of dialogue and consultation” she said, adding China was willing to make “relevant arrangements” to cooperate on fishery issues.
Before his trip to Beijing, Duterte said he would demand that China give back Filipinos’ fishing rights in Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal.
He later on said he would not make any “hard impositions” or ask for concessions from the Chinese during the state visit.
A UN-backed arbitration court in July ruled in favor of the Philippines on the sea dispute and declared that China’s claims to the South China Sea had no basis. Beijing refuses to recognize the ruling.
Other deals
Aside from maritime cooperation, officials from both countries signed 12 agreements on trade, investments and tourism, narcotics and others in an expanded bilateral meeting at the Great Hall.

‘No joint exploration’
Duterte earlier thumbed down the possibility of joint exploration between Manila and Beijing in the disputed West Philippine Sea.
In a press conference in Beijing Wednesday, the President ruled out discussions with Chinese President Xi on energy exploration.
“No, I do not think that would be right,” Duterte said, adding that the proposal for joint exploration should have the consent of Congress and the people.
“If you plan to give up something, if you plan to share what you have, if it is really yours, then you cannot talk about it only on your own. This has to be with the consent of Congress and everybody, every Filipino involved,” he said.
“So at this time, I am not empowered to do that,” the President added.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'Tian’anmen Guangchang', 'South China Basin'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Scarborough Shoal'], 'USA': ['Washington']}",security_cooperation,"['China', 'Xi Jinping', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Xi Jinping', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,1469,inquirer.net,2012-09-07T00:32:41Z,Philippines hails China vow on free navigation,"As President Benigno Aquino prepared to travel to Russia for a meeting of the leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum, Malacañang on Thursday welcomed China’s promise to ensure freedom of navigation and safety in the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea) and work with Southeast Asian nations on a code of conduct to manage territorial disputes.
Mr. Aquino leaves Friday afternoon for the Russian port city of Vladivostok, where he expects to meet Chinese President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the Apec leaders’ summit.

The summit will be held on Russkiy Island, off Vladivostok, on Saturday and Sunday.
On the eve of Mr. Aquino’s departure, presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda said the Philippines was glad that China had promised to ensure freedom of navigation and safety in the West Philippine Sea and cooperate with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) for the establishment of a code of conduct for the disputed waters.
But Lacierda added that China’s promise would be more welcome if it followed its words through with “concrete actions.”
China’s promise came on Wednesday after a meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Beijing.
“Freedom and safety of navigation in the South China Sea is assured,” Yang told a joint news conference with Clinton in the Great Hall of the People.
“For China and our neighboring countries, the South China Sea is really a lifeline for exchanges, trade and commerce. There is no issue currently in this area, nor will there ever be issues in that area in the future,” Yang said.
Lacierda said the Philippine position was maintaining the centrality of Asean in the establishment of a code of conduct for the West Philippine Sea.
The Philippines and Vietnam, both at odds with China over territory in the West Philippine Sea, are the principal proponents of the code of conduct.
The United States strongly supports the introduction of such a code, which would prevent territorial disputes in the West Philippine Sea from erupting into armed conflicts.

‘Cool down’
A day after China promised to ensure freedom and safety of navigation in the West Philippine Sea, a top Chinese newspaper told the Philippines to “cool down” in looking to US backing in settling its dispute with China.
The Global Times wrote in an editorial, “No Winners in Containment Strategy,” that the Philippines should start to be more independent in taking care of its own affairs.
The Global Times, published by the Communist Party newspaper People’s Daily, also cautioned Japan against relying on the United States in pushing its claim to the Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea.
Japan disputes ownership of the Diaoyus, which it calls Senkaku islands, and has agreed to buy them from their private Japanese owners, a move that could worsen its territorial row with China.
“The public in the Philippines and Japan have been striving to find any hint of support from the US,” the Global Times said. “But it’s time for these countries to cool down. East Asian countries should take serious measures to solve their own problems.”
The United States is pivoting back to Asia in a new military strategy that will see the deployment of 60 percent of its warships to the region by the end of the decade.
China doubts the United States will pursue the strategy to the hilt. The Global Times said: “It would be incredible if the US focused its national strength on East Asia and launched a bid for strategic containment of China. This would be costly and have no benefit for the US. Such a strategic choice would be one that the US could not bear.”
Aquino-Hu talks
Mr. Aquino and Hu may discuss the dispute between the Philippines and China over Panatag Shoal (Scarborough Shoal) and some islands in the Spratly chain in the West Philippine Sea during their meeting on Russkiy Island, that is, if the Chinese side will bring up the issue.
In an interview with Filipino reporters at the Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, site of the Apec meeting, Foreign Undersecretary Laura Q. del Rosario said there was a “mutual interest” between the Philippines and China in a bilateral meeting.
The two sides, however, have yet to firm up when the meeting between Mr. Aquino and Hu will be held and what the agenda will be, Del Rosario said.
In Manila, Assistant Secretary Raul Hernandez, spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), also said the proposed meeting between Mr. Aquino and Hu had yet to be confirmed.
If the meeting goes ahead, it will be the two leaders’ first meeting since Mr. Aquino’s state visit to China in August 2011 and since the Philippines stepped back from a two-month maritime standoff with China at Panatag Shoal in mid-June.
“Our problem is that do they have a common time, you know, because, I think, the leader of the Chinese economy is also very busy,” Del Rosario said.
“I’m sure we are not the only one who want to meet with him. Remember they are 21,” she said, referring to the 21 Apec leaders.
“Even if we just get requests from half of them, that will already fill up your three and a half hours. Each leader only has three and half hours to accommodate all the requests so it is really complicated. I don’t know how the last final list will look like.”
China asked for talks
In a briefing for reporters in Malacañang last week, Del Rosario said China had asked for the bilateral meeting, and Mr. Aquino would accept, though he would not initiate discussion of the territorial dispute between the Philippines and China.
If Hu raised the dispute, Del Rosario said Mr. Aquino would explain to him what the Philippines was doing to deescalate it.
If Hu would not raise it, Mr. Aquino would discuss reinvigorating trade between China and the Philippines, Del Rosario said.
On Thursday, she said there was no “preagreed agenda” for the meeting.
“It’s anybody’s guess, but definitely these bilaterals add to the—what do you call that—to the improvement of understanding between two sides whether it’s China, whether it’s—let’s say it’s Peru or Chile—you know,” Del Rosario said. “It’s a very rare moment for these leaders to be together.”
So far, Del Rosario said, Mr. Aquino had confirmed meetings with Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and Chilean President Sebastian Pinera Echenique. With reports from Tarra Quismundo and AFP

Philippines,5407,manilastandard.net,2014-12-01T00:01:00Z,‘China to protect territorial interests’,"Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a key foreign policy speech that the rising Asian nation would protect its sovereign territory, the Xinhua news agency reported, as it faces maritime disputes with several neighbours. “We should firmly uphold China’s territorial sovereignty, maritime rights and interests and national unity,” Xi told a Communist Party meeting on foreign affairs held on Friday and Saturday, according to excerpts of his speech released by Xinhua on Sunday. Ties between China and Japan have been strained over the past two years after Tokyo nationalised the Senkaku islands—which it already administered—in the East China Sea. Beijing also claims the chain, which it calls the Diaoyu islands. China and Southeast Asian countrie—including Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei —also have competing claims for the Spratly islands in the South China Sea. Taiwan, which China considers part of its sovereign territory, also has a claim to part of the Spratlys. Xi, both China’s president and Communist Party secretary, added his country would “properly handle territorial and island disputes” but did not name them. Relations between China and Japan have improved after Xi and Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met on November 10, but Chinese coastguard ships have continued to patrol waters around the disputed islands.On a more conciliatory note, Xi told officials at the meeting that China sought “peaceful development” and opposed the “wilful use or threat of force”. The leaders of the United States, Australia and Japan earlier this month called for peaceful resolutions of maritime disputes, after US President Barack Obama warned of the dangers of outright conflict in Asia as China contests disputed territory. China views the US foreign policy “pivot” to the Asia-Pacific region as an attempt to contain it. The Chinese leader made no direct reference to the United States in the portions of his speech released by Xinhua, other than saying Beijing should “manage well” relations with other major countries. “We should fully recognise the uncertainty in China’s neighbouring environment, but we should also realise that the general trend of prosperity and stability in the Asia-Pacific region will not change,” Xi said.",1,,,"{'None': ['Asia', 'Spratly Islands'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'International Asia-Pacific Convention Center'], 'JPN': ['Japan', 'Tokyo', 'Diaoyu Islands'], 'VNM': ['Socialist Republic of Vietnam', 'South China Sea'], 'MYS': ['Malaysia'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'BRN': ['Brunei Darussalam'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan', 'East China Sea'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'AUS': ['Commonwealth of Australia']}",security_cooperation,"['China', 'Xi Jinping', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Xi Jinping', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

Philippines,1466,inquirer.net,2012-09-22T01:39:52Z,President Aquino backs Trillanes story,"President Benigno Aquino III on Friday disclosed that Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV’s unofficial talks with the Chinese helped ease tensions between the Philippines and China over Panatag Shoal in the West Philippine Sea.
But Mr. Aquino made it clear that going through the back channel was not Malacañang’s idea, but Trillanes’ and that he approved it to achieve a peaceful resolution of the confrontation with China at Panatag Shoal (Scarborough Shoal) in April.
ADVERTISEMENT
That could be the last time an unofficial negotiator would speak for the government. Malacañang said it had learned a lesson from the controversy that Trillanes had caused: the government should speak with one voice in dealing with China on the West Philippine Sea dispute.
Speaking to reporters after he opened the Aquino-Diokno Shrine and the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ Center for Human Rights Dialogue at Fort Magsaysay in Laur, Nueva Ecija province, Mr. Aquino said Trillanes was in China at the height of the Panatag Shoal standoff. Trillanes called him to say Chinese officials approached the senator about being a back-channel negotiator, Mr. Aquino said.
“So in the absence of any other channel existing beforehand, and as we wanted to resolve the Scarborough Shoal standoff peacefully, we decided we would lose nothing from hearing them out,” Mr. Aquino said.
Trillanes disclosed his unofficial role in the resolution of the standoff in a quarrel with Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile on Wednesday over a bill that would divide Camarines Sur into two provinces.
Enrile read into the Senate records diplomatic notes that suggested Trillanes was working to advance China’s interests and was undermining the Philippines’ position in the dispute. Trillanes, according to the notes from Ambassador to China Sonia Brady, claimed credit for the withdrawal of up to 40 Chinese ships from Panatag Shoal.
Enrile demanded to know who Trillanes had talked with in his 15 meetings in Beijing and what he had agreed on with the Chinese.
President Aquino acknowledged Trillanes’ contribution to the clearing of Panatag Shoal after Philippine vessels stepped back from the face-off with Chinese ships in mid-June.
“When Chinese vessels arrived at Scarborough Shoal, we counted up to 18 ships, not including the fishing vessels, which would have added up to 30 vessels,” Mr. Aquino said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Effective strategy
“The number of Chinese vessels eventually dwindled, so maybe Trillanes’ efforts to negotiate with Chinese officials should get some credit, as well as other efforts to prevent the tension from escalating,” the President said.
Mr. Aquino said informal talks were effective in resolving any standoff.
“Look at the hostage crises,” he said. “There are formal channels for negotiations. There are also informal channels for talks. These two separate negotiations work hand in hand to resolve the hostage crisis,” he said.
Formal channels are the domain of diplomats, but Malacañang needs informal channels through which it can relay its views quickly on the Panatag Shoal dispute, he said.
Mr. Aquino, however, did not disclose Trillanes’ agreements with his Chinese contacts.
“I am actually reluctant to disclose more details about the backroom talks because these were informal and must not be made public,” Mr. Aquino said.
Special envoy
But he said he had given Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas II “a very simple instruction” when he tapped him to be the government’s special representative to China.
“He has to make sure he will express our thoughts to the highest levels of leadership of the People’s Republic of China so the Philippine position is clear to them,” Mr. Aquino said.
“The position will detail where we come from and what our insights reveal about the situation,” he said. “If they respond, that is good. If they do not, at least we have expressed what we really feel about the dispute.”
Roxas is in China as a special Philippine envoy to the 9th China-Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Expo. He will meet Chinese officials, including Vice President Xi Jinping, expected to replace President Hu Jintao next year, for economic discussions. His talks with them are expected to touch on the West Philippine Sea dispute, Malacañang said.
As for Trillanes, his role in the talks with China is uncertain.
Strategic Communication Secretary Ricky Carandang said on Friday that President Aquino would decide whether to keep Trillanes as backroom negotiator.
“Whether or not his job is finished is up to the President to determine,” Carandang said.
One voice
But the Palace had learned a very simple lesson from the controversy caused by Trillanes, Carandang said.
“The lesson we’ve learned is that it is important for the government, when we face the outside world, in this case China, to speak with one voice,” Carandang said by phone.
“It’s important that regardless of what we’re doing, what approaches we’re making, we speak with one voice,” he said.
Carandang declined to comment when asked if he thought Trillanes’ talks with Chinese officials in Beijing and Manila had done more harm than good, as Foreign Secretary del Rosario had said.
“Trillanes’ job at the time was to find a way to ease tension by opening dialogue with Chinese officials, which he did,” Carandang said.
“He was not there to recommend policy, or do anything more than to ease the tension,” he said.
Standoff not over
Carandang declined to say whether he thought Trillanes indeed contributed to the easing of tensions in the West Philippine Sea.
The standoff at Panatag Shoal is not really over, with three Chinese vessels still there, according to Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin.
Carandang confirmed that there were still Chinese vessels at the shoal. But he said the tension had been reduced.
“We’re hopeful that we can continue to talk to the Chinese to resolve the issue,” he said. “The issue of claims over Scarborough Shoal remains. We’re hoping to continue dialogue with them to help resolve the issue.”
Back channels
Would Malacañang resort to back channels again in dealing with China?
“If it makes sense and will be helpful, we will do that,” Carandang said. “It would depend on a case to case basis.”

The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Tuesday categorically denied the Philippines entered into a so-called “new model” agreement with the Chinese government, saying no official from the Marcos administration had acted on its behalf in connection with the Ayungin Shoal.
“The DFA wishes to emphasize that only the President of the Republic of the Philippines can approve or authorize agreements entered into by the Philippine Government on matters pertaining to the West Philippine Sea and South China Sea,” the DFA said in a statement.
“In this respect, the DFA can confirm that no Cabinet-level official of the Marcos administration has agreed to any Chinese proposal pertaining to the Ayungin Shoal,” the department added.
According to the DFA, as far as the Philippine government is concerned, “no such document, record or deal exists, as purported by the Chinese Embassy.”
The Chinese Embassy in Manila earlier said that the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Western Command (WESCOM) made an agreement with China early this year on a so-called “new model” for managing the situation at the Ayungin Shoal.
It claimed that this “new model” was approved by the Philippine government, including the Department of National Defense (DND).
Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro, Jr. has already denied that the DND was involved in any agreement with China regarding a supposed “new model” of conduct in the Ayungin Shoal.
Teodoro said there was no discussion or briefing on a “gentleman’s agreement” or “new model,” as claimed by the Chinese Embassy, during a courtesy call by Ambassador Huang Xilian a few days after the defense chief assumed office in July 2023.
The National Security Council has similarly denied the Chinese Embassy’s claim, describing it “absolutely absurd, ludicrous, and preposterous.”",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'South China Basin'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila']}",security_cooperation,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

Philippines,5784,inquirer.net,2015-04-21T17:09:31Z,"PH, US mock assaults 'take back' beach facing South China Sea","ADVERTISEMENT
Video by Ryan Leagogo/INQUIRER.net
SAN ANTONIO, Philippines – Hundreds of US and Philippine marines launched mock assaults on a beach facing the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea) on Tuesday in Zambales province.
The exercise, which is part of a territorial defense scenario, comes amid China’s bolder activities in the disputed sea.
Zambales is near the Scarborough (Panatag) Shoal in the South China Sea, an area within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone but is already under Beijing’s control.
Only recently Chinese coastguardsmen drove away Filipino fishermen from the shoal, a traditional fishing ground, using water cannon. Same instances have also been reported in the past.
About 350 members of the Philippine Marines and 400 US Marines participated in the amphibious landing demonstration witnessed by top defense officials including Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin, Armed Forces chief General Gregorio Catapang and commanders of the major services in the Naval Education and Training Command here.
“This is a territorial defense-based scenario where aggressive forces had taken some terrain and we were going to take it back,” said Brigadier General Christopher Mahoney, US assistant director for the Balikatan.
The supposed scenario: A government had a strained relation with a fictitious neighboring country of Calabanya that led to aggressive military action and invasion by Calabanyan forces in Luzon.
The operation was supported by 21 amphibious assault vehicles, four UH1 Cobras, two Hueys and two AV8 Harriers which provided simulated close air support. The AAVs were launched from USS Green Bay, an amphibious ship.
ADVERTISEMENT
About 11,000 US and Filipino soldiers are participating in the annual war games that will be held for 10 days. This is also the biggest Balikatan war games in 15 years.
This year, the war games will focus on maritime security.
Both countries have earlier dismissed that the war games were directed to any other country, particularly China.
“Where there is contention we don’t escalate the problem. This is an exercise testing the capability of both forces and we are not looking at other things,” said Lieutenant Colonel Dorotheo Jose Jalandoni, chief of staff for the Balikatan exercises.
“We know that eventually that the core competency of the AFP will be territorial defense and that’s where we are transitioning,” he also said.
Jalandoni also said the Philippines would also acquire AAVs in the future.
“We will acquire AAVs and this exercise is a good measure. Looking at it when it arrives we are prepared already,” he said. AC

According to Chinese online media Sina news, China on January 15 flew its first visitors to the newly built airport on the island, which the Chinese have been calling “Yongshu island.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The man-made island’s first visitors were reported to be wives and children of soldiers and officers garrisoned on the island.
A series of photos posted on the news website showed the plane of the civilians landing in the airports and the civilians gleefully welcomed by the Chinese soldiers.
Sought for his comment, Assistant Secretary Charles Jose, spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs said, that as of Tuesday, the Philippine authorities were “still studying the case.”
The report came two weeks after China announced it has successfully landed test flights on the 3,125-meter-long runway of the airstrip on the artificial island it had built on Kagitingan Reef, one of the marine features within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.
This sparked anger and worries among the other claimants of the South China Sea.
Both the Philippines and Vietnam filed their respective diplomatic protests against China’s recent activities.
Jose, in an interview earlier, said the recent test flights conducted by China were “provocative actions restricting the freedom of navigation and overflight in the West Philippine Sea.”

“Some 100 Chinese fishing boats have been withdrawn from the waters off the Philippine-administered Pag-asa Island in the South China Sea, an emissary from the Chinese government told this columnist on June 4,” he wrote in his Manila Times column on Thursday.
ADVERTISEMENT
Tulfo said this was China’s “initial gesture to win the trust and confidence of the Philippine government.”
“We want to send the message that we love your President,” he quoted the emissary as saying.
Tulfo said it was through this emissary that he was able to reach out to some Chinese officials for backdoor talks.
Based on his conversation with the emissary, who is in Manila for business, the remaining small fishing boats will be towed by bigger boats.
“Eventually, the Chinese emissary said, the fishing boats off Pag-asa ‘will disappear’,” Tulfo said.
Military officials contacted by INQUIRER.net have not yet responded to confirm Tulfo’s statements.
Maritime militia
Tulfo said he was told by the emissary that the fishing boats were owned by the militia of the People’s Liberation Army of China.
He said he was also told that “the boats were not armed, but their sheer number was meant to intimidate an enemy ship.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Observers and the Philippine military have earlier said the Chinese vessels were likely monitoring the ongoing upgrade of facilities in Pag-asa.
Last April, the Philippines filed a protest on the reported presence of a large number of Chinese vessels around the sandbars near Pag-asa, the only Philippine outpost with a civilian community.
It was earlier reported that dozens of Chinese fishing vessels have been staying near Pag-asa on a daily basis since January, which have accumulated to 275 boats in total for the first quarter.
Chinese vessels were also monitored close to other Philippine outposts like Panata and Kota.
Despite losing to a Philippine challenge in the UN-backed Permanent Court of Arbitration in July 2016, China insists it owns almost all of the South China Sea, including waters close to the shores of other claimants in the strategic waterway. West Philippine Sea refers to the part claimed by the Philippines.
Besides the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan also claim parts of the South China Sea. (Editor: Katherine G. Adraneda)

Three Indian soldiers were killed in a violent face-off on the Chinese border, the Indian army said Tuesday, following weeks of rising tensions and the deployment of thousands of extra troops from both sides. Brawls erupt regularly between the two nuclear-armed giants across their disputed 3,500-kilometre (2,200-mile) frontier, but no-one has been killed in decades.
The Indian army said there were “casualties on both sides” in Monday’s incident on the Himalayan frontier between China’s Tibet and India’s Ladakh region.
“The loss of lives on the Indian side includes an officer and two soldiers,” India’s army spokesman said in a statement.
Both sides blamed each other for the incident, with Beijing accusing Indian soldiers of crossing into Chinese territory.
But New Delhi’s foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava hit back, saying the clash arose from “an attempt by the Chinese side to unilaterally change the status quo” on the border.
An Indian army officer in the region told AFP there had been no shooting in the incident, on precipitous, rocky terrain in the strategically important Galwan Valley. “It was violent hand-to-hand scuffles,” the officer said on condition of anonymity.
– ‘Attacking Chinese personnel’ –
Beijing confirmed a clash took place and accused Indian soldiers of “attacking Chinese personnel”.
Indian troops “crossed the border line twice… provoking and attacking Chinese personnel, resulting in serious physical confrontation between border forces on the two sides,” China’s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Tuesday.
We again solemnly request that India follows the relevant attitude and restrains its frontline troops,” he added. China’s defence ministry confirmed the incident had resulted in casualties but did not give the nationality of the victims or any other details.
India and China have long squabbled about their border but recent weeks have seen an escalation.
On May 9, several Indian and Chinese soldiers were injured in a clash involving fists and stone-throwing at Naku La in India’s Sikkim state, which borders Bhutan, Nepal and China.
Alice Wells, the top US State Department official for South Asia, likely irked Beijing last month when she said China was seeking to upset the regional balance and had to be “resisted”.
But the Chinese foreign ministry said only last week a “positive consensus” was reached following “effective communication” through diplomatic and military channels.
India’s foreign ministry too sounded conciliatory, saying the two sides would “continue the military and diplomatic engagements to resolve the situation and to ensure peace and tranquillity in the border areas”.
However, Indian sources and news reports suggested that Chinese troops remained in parts of the Galwan Valley and of the northern shore of the Pangong Tso lake that it occupied in recent weeks.
“We are at an extremely worrisome juncture in the relationship,” former Indian ambassador to China and foreign secretary Nirupama Menon Rao told AFP.
– Prickly relations –
India and China have never even agreed on the length of their “Line of Actual Control” frontier, and each side uses different frontier proposals made by Britain to China in the 19th century to back their claims.
They fought a brief war in 1962 in which China took territory from India. Further deadly clashes followed in 1967, but the last shot fired in anger was in 1975.
In 2017 there was a 72-day showdown after Chinese forces moved into the disputed Doklam plateau on the China-India-Bhutan border.
After that India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese leader Xi Jinping appeared to ease tensions at two summits.
“If not handled correctly this can really escalate into something much bigger than we had initially imagined,” Harsh Pant from the Observer Research Foundation think-tank told AFP, calling China’s statement “worrying”.
“China, with its better infrastructure, with its better military capabilities, perhaps thinks that this is the time to push India, to see how far India will go,” Pant told AFP.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'Tibet Autonomous Region'], 'IND': ['Republic of India', 'Sikkim', 'New Delhi', 'Ladākh'], 'BTN': ['Kingdom of Bhutan'], 'NPL': ['Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal'], 'GBR': ['United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'], 'PHL': ['Manila']}",security_force_facility_presence,"['Chinese', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Chinese']","['Chinese', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,1555,inquirer.net,2012-10-12T05:28:33Z,"Subic military base buildup vital to DND, US","CITY OF SAN FERNANDO—The plan of the Department of National Defense (DND) to develop a military base inside the Subic free port is a critical part of the country’s national security program, a defense official said.
It is also critical to the United States’ plan to “pivot” to Asia, a new military strategy that will see 60 percent of US warships shifting to the region by the end of the decade.
ADVERTISEMENT
The planned shift, announced earlier this year, has drawn sharp criticism from Beijing, which sees it as a strategy to contain China, an emerging military power whose increasing aggressiveness in asserting its claims in Southeast Asian waters is causing worries in the region.
While Washington has sought to assure Beijing that the strategy is not intended to box in China, the United States has proceeded to conclude agreements with Singapore and Australia that will allow shelter for US war groups in the region.
The United States also conducts regular joint military maneuvers with Asian countries, often billed as civil-military exercises for disaster preparedness.
Going on in the Philippines, which has a mutual defense treaty with the United States, are joint exercises between US and Philippine marines, and the venue is exactly where the DND plans to build a base that a spokesperson for the department says is vital to the country’s security program.
AFP modernization
“The Armed Forces [of the Philippines] is modernizing in a very aggressive [way],” Peter Paul Galvez, DND spokesperson, told the Philippine Daily Inquirer by phone on Wednesday.
“In a few months, we are embarking in procurement and we intend to use those areas in Subic for our air platform and naval assets,” Galvez said.
“We have a big interest in the area,” he said, referring to the 200-hectare airport complex in the Subic free port, a former US naval base at the boundary between Zambales and Bataan provinces.
Officials of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) earlier announced that the agency wanted to convert the idle Subic Bay International Airport (SBIA) into a tourism and commercial hub, like Sentosa Island in Singapore.

Part of modernization
But SBMA Chairman Roberto Garcia later said the plan would not proceed because the DND wanted to use the airport as a military base.
The DND, Galvez said, has asked Congress to approve P75 billion for the modernization of the military in five years.
Part of the modernization program is a plan that calls for the Philippine Air Force (PAF) to use SBIA at Cubi Point and the adjacent seaport, Galvez said.
The US Navy built the airport during the Korean War in the 1950s. It left Subic in November 1991, two months after the Philippine Senate rejected the extension of the Philippine-US military bases agreement.
The Philippine government, through the SBMA, converted Subic into a special economic zone and free port.
Galvez said discussions with the SBMA had not yet touched on leases.
“These are really needed, really perfect. These are very ideal. It is cheaper to locate [in Subic] than replicate [the facilities] elsewhere,” Galvez said.
“Subic can handle large aircraft. It has a deep sea,” he added.
SBMA understands
Asked if the SBMA resisted the DND plan, Galvez replied, “They understand.”
“Having a military base in Subic is good for everyone there. It will support economic growth,” he said. “It is strategic for all. We are intently looking at it. We need the facilities.”
Galvez said the military had retained Air Force units at the free port in Clark, Pampanga province.
The Air Force units at the 300-hectare Air Force City in Clark are the First Air Division, 600th Air Base Wing, Air Logistic Command, Air Reserve Command, 710th Special Operations Wing and 410th Maintenance Wing.
In exchange for the lease, the Air Force helps secure the international airport and aviation areas in the free port at Clark.
Galvez said he had no information yet on which units would move to Subic. There is no schedule yet for the construction of the military base there, he added.
Not aimed at China
Aware of the potential repercussions of the plan, Galvez said the base was not part of efforts to beef up the capability of the Philippines to deal with China’s aggressiveness in asserting its territorial claims in the West Philippine Sea.
China’s insistence that it owns the entire sea has led to a face-off between Philippine and Chinese ships at Panatag Shoal (Scarborough Shoal) from early April to mid-June, about the time US officials were going around the region explaining the new US military strategy.
But the plan to build a military base in Subic, Galvez said, has been existing since the 1990s. “It got waylaid for lack of funding,” he said.
“Our country needed strategic sites to monitor [our seas] and land, and these sites have national security implications,” he said.
The development of the new military base does not include engaging the US military for its use or even for shared use, he said.
Should troops from the United States or Australia use the Air Force facilities in Subic, this would be covered by the Visiting Forces Agreement with those countries, he said.

Philippines,4323,manilastandard.net,2014-05-19T21:01:00Z,Japan to build new military outposts in remote islands,"TOKYO—Japan is to establish new military outposts on remote islands, a report said Monday, as Tokyo looks to bolster its defence amid a territorial dispute with China. Up to 350 troops each could be stationed on three islands in the far southwest, close to the Senkakus, which Beijing claims as its own under the name Diaoyus, the mass-selling Yomiuri Shimbun reported. With the exception of the main Okinawa island, Japan’s Ground Self-Defense Forces -- its army -- have no bases on the chain of islands that runs from the bottom of Kyushu to Taiwan. There are limited air force facilities in the area. The lack of substantial military presence is a source of worry for some in Japan, who caution that it leaves Japan vulnerable to China’s increasingly assertive stance. Chinese ships have repeatedly moved into the Senkakus’ territorial waters, since Tokyo nationalised some of them in September 2012, to confront Japanese vessels. The islands lie around 2,000 kilometres (1,250 miles) southwest of Tokyo and around 200 kilometres from the north of Taiwan. While most of the bickering has been between coastguards from both sides, observers say military ships are loitering over the horizon, with some warning of the risk of a confrontation.Beijing has spent heavily on its military in recent years in a bid to develop a “blue water” navy that can project force far out into the Pacific. This means getting through what it calls the “first island chain” including Japan’s southwestern islands and the northern Philippines. Tokyo is now planning to set up new outposts on three islands, including Amamioshima, some 150 kilometres (93 miles) south of the Senkakus, the Yomiuri said, citing unnamed senior defence ministry officials. Deputy defence minister Ryota Takeda will visit Amamioshima this week to look at establishing a joint research project with the island, it said. Two other candidate sites for the new posts include Miyako island and Ishigaki island, some 210 kilometres southwest and 170 kilometres south, respectively, of the disputed islets.",0,,,"{'JPN': ['Japan', 'Kyūshū Chihō', 'Tokyo', 'Miyako Island', 'Vessel Hotel Ishigaki Island'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan'], 'USA': ['Pacific'], 'PHL': ['University of Northern Philippines']}",security_force_facility_presence,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

Philippines,4094,manilastandard.net,2014-04-29T00:01:00Z,Obama: US goal not to stifle China,"HOURS after the US signed an agreement to bring more American troops to the Philippines, US President Barack Obama said Washington’s goal was not to contain China amid a festering territorial dispute over the West Philippine Sea. “Our goal is not to counter China. Our goal is not to contain China,” Obama said in a joint press conference with President Benigno Aquino III after the two leaders met in Malacañang. Obama said the US goal is to make sure that international rules and norms are respected in maritime disputes. “We do not have claims in this area territorially. We are an Asia Pacific nation and our primary interest is the peaceful resolution of conflict, freedom of navigation that allows for continued progress and prosperity,” said Obama who arrived in the country on Monday for a two-day visit. He noted that the United States does not take a specific position on the disputes between nations. But, as a matter of international law and international norms, coercion and intimidation are the way to manage these disputes, the US president said. For that reason, Obama said, he supports the Philippine approach to seek international arbitration to resolve the dispute in a diplomatic fashion. “We don’t go around sending ships and threatening folks. What we do is we sit down and we have some people in the room. It’s boring, it’s not exciting but it’s usually a good way to work out these problems and work out these issues,” said the world’s most powerful man. “I do think that as President Aquino said very persuasively that China as a large country has already asserted that it is interested in abiding by international law. And really our message to China consistently in a whole range of issues is we want be a partner with you in upholding international law. In fact, larger countries have a greater responsibility in abiding by international norms and rules because when we move, it can worry smaller countries if we don’t do it in a way that’s consistent with international law,” he said. He said leaders of the other Asian countries he visited like Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia want to resolve these issues peacefully and diplomatically. “That’s why I think that the approach that President Aquino has been taking --- putting this before international arbitration is a sound one,” Obama said. Obama added that he believes that if China listens to its neighbors and recognizes that there is another approach to resolve these disputes, it will find that they have ready and willing partners throughout the Asia Pacific region that want to work with them on trade and commerce and selling goods and buying goods. “And it’s inevitable that China is going to be a dominant power in this region just by sure size. Nobody, I think, denies that,” said the US President. “The question is just whether other countries in the region are also able to succeed and prosper on their own terms and attend to the various interests and needs that they and their people have as well. And that’s what we support,” said Obama. Aquino said that from the very onset, the country’s message to China is to achieve greater prosperity for the people of both nations. But for this to happen, there must be stability, he said. “They [the Chinese] in return have responded that the disputes in the South China Sea, West Philippine Sea, are not the end-all and be-all of our relationships. And we have had good cooperation with them in so many different fronts and perhaps one can’t even argue that this is the only sour point in our relationship,” Aquino said. Aquino said it was more important for the Philippines and China to bring prosperity to their people than to quarrel over “a few rocks” that are uninhabitable. In time, he added, China might see the soundness of this proposition and act in a way that strengthened stability in the region. “That is our hope,” Aquino said. Obama said the goal of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) signed by the US and the Philippines was wide-ranging. “We’ve had decades of alliance with the Philippines but, obviously, in the 21st century we have to continue to update that. And the goal for this agreement is to build Philippine capacity, to engage in training, engage in coordination—not simply to deal with issues of maritime security, but also to enhance our capabilities so that if there’s a natural disaster that takes place, we are able to potentially respond more quickly,” he said. If new threats arise, Obama added, both countries would be able to work “in a cooperative fashion.” “I think this is going to be a terrific opportunity for us to work with the Philippines to make sure that our navies, our air force are coordinated; to make sure that there is information-sharing; to allow us to respond to new threats and to work with other countries—ASEAN countries, Australia, Japan,” he said.Obama said he hoped that at some point, the US would be able to work cooperatively with China as well, because the goal is to make sure that everyone operates in a peaceful, responsible way. “When that happens, that allows countries to focus on what is more important to people day-to-day and that is prosperity, growth, jobs. Those are the things that we as leaders should be focused on.... And if we have security arrangements that avoid conflict and dispute, then we’re able to place our attention on where we should be focusing.,” he said. Obama said he has been consistent through his travels in Asia. “We welcome China’s peaceful rise. We have a constructive relationship with China. There is enormous trade, enormous business that is done between the United States and China, a whole range of issues on the international stage in which cooperation between the United States and China are balanced,” he said. He reiterated that US has been consistent, too, in its message that maritime disputes should be resolved peacefully at an arbitral tribunal. “Obeying international law, not intimidation, is the way to settle the dispute,” said Obama, as he emphasized that the agreement signed Monday was not aimed at re-establishing American bases in the Philippines. He said the EDCA will only rotate US troops in Philippine facilities so they can train and work together to build the defense capability of both countries. Aquino added that the agreement would take the security cooperation between the two countries to a higher level and reaffirm their commitment to mutual defense and security to promote regional peace and stability. Aquino also said that arbitration was “an open, friendly, and peaceful approach to seeking a just and durable solution.” Both leaders also cited the importance of the full and effective implementation of the Declaration of Conduct and the expeditious conclusion of a substantive and legally binding Code of Conduct in the South China Sea to foster peace and stability in Asia. Aquino said his meeting with Obama was comprehensive and significant. “It accorded President Obama and myself the opportunity to build on the relations between our countries, and discuss our strategic vision for the future of the Philippines-United States relationship—a relationship that is modern, mature, and forward-looking, and one that allows us to surpass challenges, towards the benefit of our peoples, the entire region, and the world,” he said. Obama arrived onboard Air Force One at 1:30 p.m. Monday from Kuala Lumpur. On hand to greet the US President were Vice President Jejomar Binay, US Ambassador Philip Goldberg, Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario, Interior and Local Governments Secretary Manuel Roxas II, Roxas, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Cuisia and Maj. Gen Jeffrey Delgado, Air Force chief. Manila is the last leg on Obama’s four-nation tour of Asia. Amid tight security, Obama boarded the Marine One helicopter and proceeded to Malacanang to attend the official welcome ceremony. After the ceremony, the President invited Obama to enter the Palace for the signing of the guest book at the reception hall before proceeding to the Music Room for the “meet-and-greet” before their expanded meeting. Obama wrote on the guestbook a thank you note to the Philippines for welcoming him on the start of his two-day state-visit on Monday, calling the country America’s “oldest alliance in Asia.” In the note posted in the official Twitter and Facebook accounts of Aquino, the US President wrote: “I thank President Aquino and the people of the Philippines for welcoming me.” “May America’s oldest alliance in Asia always be renewed by our friendship and mutual respect,” the note read, with Obama’s signature affixed below.

Philippines,21517,mb.com.ph,2019-07-23T10:52:52Z,Not one of our soldiers will come home alive if we deploy them to drive China away from WPS - Duterte,"By Genalyn Kabiling
No one will come home alive if the country’s marines and coast guard personnel will be deployed to drive away China from the West Philippine Sea, President Duterte conceded on Monday.
The President said the country owns the West Philippine Sea, but China, which has installed guided missiles that can reach Manila in seven minutes, has possession over the disputed property.
“Ipadala ko ‘yung Marines ko [If I send the Marines] to drive away the Chinese fishermen, I guarantee you, not one of them will come home alive,” he said during his State of the Nation Address (SONA) before a joint session of Congress.
“We do it in a confrontation doon [there]. We try to drive them away, it could lead to a violence,” said Duterte, who has preferred peaceful dialogue over the use of force in dealing with the territorial conflict with China.
Duterte said even if he sends the naval frigates to drive out China, they will be wiped out “because there are already guided missiles in that island.”
“I cannot go there even to bring the Coast Guard to drive them away. China also claims the property and it is in possession. ‘Yan ang problema. Sila ‘yung in possession [That’s the problem. They are in possession] and claiming all the resources there as an owner,” he said.
The President assured groups asking him to stand up and stop those who are fishing in the country’s exclusive economic zone that he would do it “in due time.”
The President has drawn criticisms over his alleged soft stance in asserting the country’s ownership of the West Philippine Sea amid China’s sweeping claims.
Duterte earlier admitted that China cannot be prevented from fishing in the country’s waters since they are in control of the area. He previously mentioned a mutual agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping allowing China to fish in the country’s waters after Beijing agreed not to block the access of Filipino fishermen to Panatag Shoal.
In his SONA, the President defended the fishing arrangement between the Philippines and China, saying this was a “mutual” agreement since both nations have claims in the area.
“When I said, ‘I allowed,’ that was on the premise that I own the property pero hindi tayo [but we are not] in control of the property,” he said.
Amid the fishing controversy, Duterte said he also invoked the “traditional fishing rights” that is recognized by the arbitral ruling on the South China Sea as well as the international maritime laws.
“China and everybody recognize traditional fishing rights for the natives who were there even before the creation of republics and governments. That law is a humane law,” he added.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'South China Basin'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila']}",security_force_facility_presence,"['China', 'Xi Jinping', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Xi Jinping', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,31561,inquirer.net,2021-04-01T05:34:47Z,Task force answers China radio message: Withdraw your militia,"A Philippine military plane patrolling the West Philippine Sea this week spotted scores of Chinese vessels at several reefs within the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and received several radio messages telling it to leave the areas claimed by China.
In response, the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea (NTF-WPS) on Wednesday demanded that China “immediately withdraw these vessels flying its flag,” noting that they were Chinese maritime militia in waters over which the Philippines had sovereign rights.
ADVERTISEMENT
The task force repeated the same demand contained in a formal diplomatic protest filed by Manila on March 21 against the presence of more than 200 Chinese vessels at Julian Felipe (Whitsun) Reef, within the Philippines’ 370-kilometer EEZ.
“The NTF-WPS reiterates its assertion of Philippine sovereignty, and sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the [Kalayaan Island Group] and [WPS], and expresses deep concern over the continuing unlawful presence (swarming) of the Chinese Maritime Militia (CMM), which did not pull out and have remained in Julian Felipe Reef and are now in other areas of the Kalayaan Island Group in the municipality of Kalayaan, Palawan,” the task force said in a statement.
President Duterte himself had spoken with China’s ambassador, Huang Xilian, to express the government’s concern over the presence of the large number of Chinese vessels at Julian Felipe. The ambassador said they were just fishing boats seeking shelter from bad weather.
The NTF-WPS reported that 220 militia vessels were first seen at the reef by the Philippine Coast Guard on March 7. The number went down to 183 on March 22, then rose to 199 on March 27.
More at other reefs
There were 44 left as of Monday but the task force said more than 100 such vessels were monitored at other reefs—115 at Chigua (Kennan) Reef, 50 others dispersed around Panganiban (Mischief) Reef, Kagitingan (Fiery) Reef and Zamora (Subi) Reef, and 45 off Pag-asa (Thitu) Island occupied by Filipinos—all part of the Philippines’ Kalayaan Island Group.
Four Chinese Navy ships were also seen at Panganiban.
China had built artificial islands with reclaimed land from these four reefs and in other parts of the South China Sea that are within the Philippine EEZ. China has turned them into military outposts, with runways and missile emplacements.
The Chinese began occupying Panganiban in 1995. It is now the biggest of the seven artificial islands built by China.
In 2016, the international arbitral tribunal invalidated China’s sweeping claims to the South China Sea, and ruled that, among other things, Panganiban was part of the Philippine continental shelf. Beijing refused to recognize the ruling.

Avoid ‘misunderstanding’
On Tuesday, a Philippine military plane flying over the disputed waters carrying military photographers and several local journalists, received at least five messages from a Chinese radio operator telling the pilot to leave the area.
“You are approaching a Chinese reef,” one radio call said. “To avoid any move that may cause misunderstanding, please leave immediately.”
Another message specifically referred to Zamora as a Chinese reef.
The Filipino crew gave a uniform response: “This is Philippine government aircraft. We are conducting routine maritime patrol over Philippine EEZ and we are proceeding according to our planned route.”
Maj. Gen. Edgard Arevalo, spokesperson for the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said the overflight patrols would continue despite the “radio challenge” from the Chinese.
“It’s not the first time [that it happened]. And those challenges have been customary. Hence, our reply is likewise customary,” he said.
He said the military “could not readily say” that the vessels found at the other reefs had come from Julian Felipe.
According to the NTF-WPS, the mass formation of the Chinese maritime militia is hazardous to navigation and safety of life at sea.
“They may be doing illicit activities at night and their lingering (swarming) presence may cause irreparable damage to the marine environment due to marine pollution and destruction of coral reefs,” its statement said. “Their swarming also poses a threat to the peaceful exercise of sovereign rights of the Philippines in its EEZ.”
Pag-asa swarming
A similar swarming was undertaken by the Chinese on Pag-asa, the largest island in the KIG occupied by Filipino troops and civilians. Around 140 Chinese vessels moored off the island in July 2019 and more than 130 in January-February 2020.
The AFP said the presence of the Chinese vessels near Pag-asa had notably increased since 2018, after the Philippines began building a beaching ramp and sheltered port on the island.
The NTF-WPS expressed Manila’s appreciation for the statements of support from other countries which “share common adherence to rules-based order consistent with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as affirmed by the 2016 arbitral award.”
“Neither the Philippines nor the international community will ever accept China’s assertion of its so-called indisputable integrated sovereignty over almost all of the South China Sea, part of which is the WPS,” the task force said.
Former Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario on Wednesday said it may now be “imperative” for the Philippines to hold joint patrols with the United States, its sole defense treaty ally, “to confront the bullying tactics of China in the West Philippine Sea.”
“We must show the world and especially China that we are a country that will fight for our rights and able to enforce our laws in our own EEZ,” he said in a statement.
Del Rosario said an agreement on joint patrols was approved by Manila and Washington following meetings he held before stepping down with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was then deputy secretary of state.
But that was shelved by President Duterte on fears that China would be “displeased,” he said.
Locsin off to China
“However, China’s duplicity and invasion of our waters remain unabated despite the efforts of President Duterte to appease China,” Del Rosario added.
Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. on Wednesday said he would visit China this week to hold talks with the Chinese foreign minister.
The foreign ministers of Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia are also attending the meeting with Wang Yi. —WITH REPORTS FROM JEROME ANING, ROMAR MIRANDA AND TINA G. SANTOS

Philippines,15716,inquirer.net,2018-04-26T20:49:11Z,Pangilinan questions deployment of security force to Boracay,"Where are the terrorists or invaders in Boracay?
Sen. Francis Pangilinan questioned on Thursday the government’s deployment of some 600 policemen, soldiers, coast guard personnel, firemen, and civic groups to Boracay to secure the resort island when there are no terrorists or invaders in the area.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Boracay island is a tourist destination with a long coastline of soft, white sand beach. It is not a conflict area or a war zone,” Pangilinan said in a statement.
The Senator noted the contrast between the deployment of hundreds of government security personnel to Boracay and government’s timid response to China’s activities in areas that fall under the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.
China landed a military transport plane on Mischief Reef and built a monument on Fiery Cross Reef to mark its construction activities there, but the government’s response was a “meek submission,” according to the Senator.
“It is a shame that the administration is deploying the military, police, and the coast guard in Boracay while China has been blatantly trespassing in our territory and disrespecting our sovereignty,” he said.
Pangilinan added that the actual threat in Boracay is the government because it ordered a shutdown of the resort island without a plan for the thousands of workers who stand to lose their jobs.
“It is ironic that the government can express so much love to China’s President Xi Jinping but can’t be bothered to provide jobs for the displaced Boracay workers,” he added. /ee

A Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force Y-20 transporter was spotted on Kagitingan Reef last Dec. 25, Hong Kong-based news agency South China Morning Post reported last Friday (Jan. 1).

Satellite images of the Chinese plane’s presence on the reef were posted by Ken Joyce, director of product management of American space technology company Maxar Technologies. The plane was not observed loading or unloading cargo.
The report identified the Y-20 built by the Xian Aircraft Industry Corporation as the biggest aircraft in China’s military fleet.
Kagitingan Reef was said to be the base of one of the districts named by China in the West Philippine Sea. This had been protested by the Philippine government.
Maritime expert Prof. Jay Batongbacal said the deployment was probably “to test the plane/airfield equipment and/or to deliver supplies/personnel.”
While Kagitingan Reef is the farthest Chinese man-made reef from the Philippines, Batongbacal said an airbase built there by China would become a bigger threat once it becomes operational and hosts PLA Air Force squadrons.
“Naval base has been operational for quite some time, and currently support Chinese military/paramilitary maritime forces operating in South China Sea,” he told INQUIRER.net.
“Full operational base would place all major Philippine cities/ports/airports/military bases within striking distance of Chinese air power,” he said.
China in recent years had transformed reefs and islands into outposts fitted and equipped with harbors, airstrips, missile shelters and communications facilities which expanded its ability to monitor its and rivals’ activities in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims to almost entirely own.
The 2016 decision by the United Nations-backed arbitral tribunal in The Hague ruled that Beijing’s claims have no basis and its South China Sea construction frenzy was illegal.

Philippines,27277,manilastandard.net,2020-06-28T00:00:00Z,‘China sent militia to India border’ - Manila Standard,"China reinforced its troops near the Indian border with mountain climbers and martial arts fighters shortly before a deadly clash this month, state media reported.

Tensions are common between the two nuclear-armed neighbors in the mountainous border terrain, but this month's fighting was their deadliest encounter in over 50 years.

Five new militia divisions including former members of a Mount Everest Olympic torch relay team and fighters from a mixed martial arts club presented themselves for inspection at Lhasa on June 15, official military newspaper China National Defense News reported.

State broadcaster CCTV showed footage of hundreds of new troops lining up in the Tibetan capital.

Tibet commander Wang Haijiang said the Enbo Fight Club recruits would ""greatly raise the organization and mobilization strength"" of troops and their ""rapid response and supportability,"" China National Defense News reported, although he did not explicitly confirm their deployment was linked to ongoing border tensions.

Chinese and Indian troops clashed later that day in the most violent confrontation between the two powers in decades, in the Ladakh region 1,300 kilometers away.

India says 20 of its own soldiers were killed in brutal hand-to-hand combat that day, while China suffered an unknown number of casualties.

 
 Both sides have blamed each other for the battle, which was fought with rocks and batons without any shots fired.

India said Thursday that it had reinforced troops in the contested Himalayan border region, saying it was matching a similar buildup by China.

Chinese state media have in recent weeks highlighted military activity including high-altitude anti-aircraft drills in the Tibet region bordering India. AFP

The new troops were recruited with the aim of ""strengthening the border and stabilizing Tibet,"" China National Defense News said.

India claims Chinese troops ambushed Indian soldiers and forced them down a ridge where they had gone to remove a Chinese ""encroachment.""

Philippines,10651,manilatimes.net,2016-10-26T21:03:48Z,Duterte wants US troops out in two years,"TOKYO: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Wednesday he wants US troops out of his country in the next two years and is willing to scrap defense pacts with longtime ally Washington if necessary.
The remarks during a high-profile visit to Japan follow a series of anti-American tirades by the firebrand leader.
""I want, maybe in the next two years, my country free of the presence of foreign military troops,"" Duterte told an economic forum in Tokyo, in a clear reference to US forces, ahead of a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
""I want them out and if I have to revise or abrogate agreements, executive agreements, I will,"" he added.
The US has a small number of Special Forces on the southern island of Mindanao to aid counter-terrorism operations.
But Duterte has already said he wants US troops out of Mindanao because their presence stokes tensions on the island where Islamic militants have waged a decades-long separatist insurgency.
Duterte has repeatedly attacked the US while cozying up to Beijing, upending his nation's foreign policy in comments that have sometimes been quickly retracted.
Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay, asked to clarify the president's remarks, said that Duterte did not mean US troops would be ousted, stressing that ""our national interests still continue to converge.""
The acid-tongued leader arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday on his first visit to Japan since taking office on June 30, looking to persuade executives his country is ""open for business"", after seeming to overturn Manila's traditional diplomatic alliances.
The 71-year-old has slammed Washington for questioning his violent crime crackdown, which has claimed some 3,700 lives and attracted widespread international criticism.
South China Sea
Duterte has also insulted US President Barack Obama, calling him a ""son of a whore"" and announcing a ""separation"" from the US during a visit to Beijing last week.
Although he quickly walked back from his comments, saying that ""separation"" did not mean he would ""sever"" ties, he reiterated his calls on Wednesday for an end to all joint war games with the US.
""This will be the last maneuver war games between the United States and the Philippines' military,"" he said of an event hosted in recent weeks by the Philippines.
In Tokyo, Duterte and Abe later stressed during a joint media appearance their countries' common values as democracies that respect the rule of law.
""The Philippines will continue to work closely with Japan on issues of common concern in the region... including the South China Sea,"" Duterte said after their summit.
Japan announced loans totaling 21.3 billion yen ($204 million) to help improve the Philippines' maritime safety as well promote peace and agriculture on Mindanao.
Although his Japanese hosts depend on the US for security, Tokyo has so far not responded to Duterte's diatribes, while Washington has taken a calm approach.
Abe had worked to improve bilateral relations with Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino 3rd, providing patrol boats to support Manila in its territorial row with Beijing over rival claims to the South China Sea.
The Philippines took Beijing to an international tribunal over its extensive claims in the region and won a resounding victory in July.
But Duterte has not pressed the issue with Beijing, instead working to improve ties and attract billions of dollars in Chinese loans and investments.
Duterte, in his speech at the economic forum, attempted to calm worries in Japan over his trip to China, assuring his audience that he was not seeking military ties with Beijing, just a closer economic relationship.
""We did not talk about arms, we did not talk about stationing of troops,"" he said. ""We avoided talking about alliances, military or otherwise."" AFP

Philippines,26030,manilastandard.net,2020-03-06T03:20:00Z,"3,000 Chinese soldiers invade PH; military checking","The Armed Forces of the Philippines said Thursday it was now verifying reports that a “good number” of China’s People Liberation Army soldiers were now in the country.

“We are in the process of validating the report of Senator [Panfilo] Lacson,” AFP Chief Felimon Santos Jr. told reporters.

But Malacañang said Thursday the military should validate the reported presence of 3,000 Chinese soldiers in the Philippines first before the government takes any action, adding the claim was a “raw intelligence report.”

Lacson on Wednesday urged the authorities to validate the information that there were 2,000 to 3,000 members of China’s People Liberation Army in the Philippines who might be on an “immersion mission.”

Lacson, a former police chief, shared the unverified report a week after the police said they were investigating two Chinese murder suspects who were caught with identification cards allegedly from the PLA.

Lacson said it was possible that the PLA members were undergoing an immersion mission for still unknown purposes in the Philippines.

 
 “I have my staff for intelligence to confirm said reports in coordination with other relevant agencies of government,” Santos said.

China’s PLA consists of five branches: ground force, navy, air force, rocket force, and strategic force, and is the largest in the world.

In a radio interview last week, Senator Richard Gordon said PLA members were likely using Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators or POGOs for intelligence gathering in the country.

He claimed that PLA members may have infiltrated POGOs for intelligence gathering after identification cards of alleged PLA members were discovered from two arrested Chinese suspects in a shooting incident in Makati City last week.

On Thursday, Gordon led the hearing of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee on illegal activities such as espionage, money laundering and prostitution which are associated with the POGOs in the country. ",1,,,"{'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Makati City'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",security_force_facility_presence,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Philippines,4659,inquirer.net,2014-07-08T05:50:37Z,China’s military base on Mabini Reef violates PH Constitution,"While searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 on March 11, 2014, a Philippine Air Force plane flying over the Kalayaan Island Group in the West Philippine Sea sighted Chinese reclamation activity in the Mabini Reef within the 200 mille Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Philippines.
According to the report of the Associated Press, the reclamation project has turned the submerged reef and a sandbar of the Mabini Reef into a 30-hectare landmass that transformed the submerged coral outcrop into an islet. An aerial photo taken of the reclamation effort showed a dredging ship in the area used to suck soil and other solid materials from the surrounding areas to pour into the reclaimed area.

Aerial photo of Mabini Reef taken on March 11, 2015.
While Philippine officials have noted with alarm that China’s occupation of islets and reefs within the Philippine EEZ such as Panganiban Reef (Mischief Reef), Kagitingan Reef (Fiery Cross Reef), Calderon Reef (Cuarteron Reef), Zamora Reef (Subi Reef), and Gaven Reef, the massive land reclamation now occurring in the Mabini Reef marks a major escalation of China’s creeping invasion of the Philippines.
It is a game changer.
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario protested China’s Mabini Reef reclamation at the Asean Summit of Foreign Ministers held in Myanmar (Burma) onMay 10 where Vietnam’s foreign minister also protested China’s installation of two oil rigs in the Vietnamese EEZ.
China’s foreign minister dismissed the protests of the two nations , insisting that China has “undisputed sovereignty” over the entire South China Sea. Besides, China’s spokesman told People’s Daily “China was merely renovating the living facilities for troops stationed on the reef.”
Earlier on March 30, the Philippines submitted a brief to the United Nations Tribunal for the Convention on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) seeking to “clarify Mabini Reef’s physical character”.The Philippines had filed a complaint with ITLOS in January of 2013 seeking a ruling that China had no legal right to encroach in the Philippines EEZ and has no right to ownership of 90 percent of the 3.5-million square-kilometer South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea.
Even though Beijing has refused to take part in the UN arbitration, it is apparently speeding up its acquisition of the territories of other nations before the arbitration decision is handed which may occur in three years.
Professor Richard Heydarian of the International Relations Department at the Ateneo de Manila University believes that China is changing the facts on the ground by reclaiming and occupying disputed waters and land features.
“The way China looks at this is, down the road, they have to face the legal opinion arbitration. And if you look at the recent trends in international arbitration, they give priority and prerogative to the countries who continue to establish and exercise effective and continuous sovereignty. If China will be able to build structures there, and they turn these structures into islands and project into 200 nautical mile economic zone, somehow they’ll be able to argue this legally.”

In other words, “possession is nine-tenths of the law” which means that ownership is easier to maintain if one has possession of something, or difficult to enforce if one does not.
What is China building on Mabini Reef?
The mystery was solved when the No. 9 Design & Research Institute of China State Shipbuilding Corporation displayed on its official website its proposed design of the artificial island that will be built on Mabini Reef.
Mabini Reef in a few years.
Former National Security Adviser Roilo Golez posted the Chinese corporation’s designs on his blog and warned about the dangers posed to Philippine national security and to ASEAN stability if China completes its military installation in Mabini Reef. In an interview on ANC, Golez said:
“You can see this is probably a mile-long airstrip. It’s almost like an airport, like what you see in the international airports, that support facilities, there’s a dock for ships. I understand it can support and resupply frigates. But what is very threatening is that mile-long strip because now they can base their fighters there. I’m looking at, for example, a J-11 fighter jet made in China that has a range of 2000 miles… it encompasses the entire Philippines, most of Vietnam, part of Malaysia and and the whole of Borneo. So it can threaten all our vital military installations including the installations we can make available under EDCA.”
Proposed Chinese facilities on Mabini Reef
Inquirer.net columnist Ted Laguatan expanded on this point in his column (No choice: Destroy China’s future PH military bases now, June 27, 2014, Inquirer.net):“Having enemy fighter planes and missiles so proximate to potential target cities is like having a bag of explosives padlocked on one’s neck by a bad guy with a remote control, which he could explode anytime. The baddie has the poor guy under his complete control. With these bases in place, China can demand anything from the Philippines and take anything it wants. For all practical purposes, the Philippines will then be a slave nation.”
“The Philippines and surrounding Asian nations have no choice,” Laguatan asserted, “these future bases must be destroyed now. The fighter planes and missiles that will be deployed there will be daggers aimed at the major cities of these countries. We and they simply cannot allow these bases to be constructed.”
Malaya columnist Rey O. Arcilla (“The Mabini Reef”, May 27, 2014) argued that “we should do as Vietnam has done in the disputed Paracels where China has planted an oil rig. She stood pat despite the ramming of her ships by the Chinese and withstood the latter’s water cannons. They showed the Chinese they are ready to die for what they believe is right…”
“We should send some of our ships to Mabini Reef forthwith no matter how decrepit they are to prevent the Chinese from undertaking any more activities on the isle and turning it into another fortified military garrison like Mischief Reef. We should show the Chinese we are ready to fight and die for what is ours. Sure, we are no match for them and they can easily obliterate our naval vessels. But that would be an attack on our territory. That would be an opportunity for the US to put its money where its mouth is. Isn’t that what Edca is for?”
Edca is the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement between the U.S. and the Philippines which allows the U.S. to station troops in the Philippines but not to establish a permanent base. The nationalists and assorted leftists argue that Edca is a violation of Article XVIII Sec. 25 of the 1987 Constitution which states that “foreign military bases, troops, or facilities shall not be allowed in the Philippines” unless approved by the Congress and ratified by the people in a referendum.
But, except for Akbayan, these same nationalists who oppose Edca have not denounced China for constructing a “foreign military base” in the Philippines. While there may be a dispute as to whether Edca violates the Philippine Constitution, there is NO dispute that China’s military base on Mabini Reef is a blatant violation of the Philippine Constitution and is a clear and present danger to Philippine national security.
On this fundamental issue, the Filipino people stand united. In a nationwide poll conducted by Social Weather Station (SWS) from December 2013 through January 2014, the results showed that “an overwhelming majority of Filipinos (93 percent) back the government’s efforts to defend the national territory” (Pinoy Pulse:We must defend West PH Sea, don’t trust China, February 10, 2014, Interaksyon.com).
Please join the global protests against China on July 24, the second anniversary of China’s establishment of the Sansha Prefecture to”oversee and administer” 3.5 million square kilometers of the South China Sea over which China asserts “indisputable sovereignty.” China’s claim is the most brazen maritime territorial grab in history.
http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Filipinos-protest-China-s-actions-4682719.php?t=451f7f4f30cefdcb88
The window of opportunity for the Philippines to destroy China’s military base on Mabini Reef is rapidly closing. Once it is fully constructed and operational, it will be impossible to take out. By then, the Philippines and all of Southeast Asia will be at the tender mercy of China.

Philippines,10395,manilastandard.net,2016-10-01T00:00:00Z,US troops out in 2 yrs-Rody,"ENHANCED TIES. President Rodrigo Duterte and Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (right) attend a joint news conference at the latter’s office in Tokyo Wednesday where the Filipino leader made a pitch for enhanced economic ties with Japan, a day after hurling for the nth time fresh insults at countries that have criticized his unrelenting illegal drugs crackdown which have killed almost 4,000 since July 1. AFP
President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday said he wanted US troops out of the country in the next two years and was willing to scrap defense pacts with longtime ally Washington if necessary. But the US State Department also on Wednesday played down Duterte’s continued anti-American tirades, declining to respond to his latest attack from Japan, where he is on an official visit.The comments follow a series of anti-American rhetoric by Duterte, who has repeatedly attacked the US while cozying up to Beijing, upending his nation’s foreign policy in comments that have sometimes been quickly retracted. “I want, maybe in the next two years, my country free of the presence of foreign military troops,” Duterte told an economic forum in Tokyo, in a clear reference to US forces. “I want them out and if I have to revise or abrogate… executive agreements, I will,” he added. At a press briefing, the US State Department brushed off the President’s comments after being asked if Washington will continue doing nothing despite getting insulted by its closest ally in Southeast Asia. “I’ve said for several days now, that despite the rhetoric, we haven’t seen any policy traction behind it; in other words, there hasn’t been any change, tangible changes, to the policies and to the programs that both our nations are implementing and executing on a daily basis,” US State Department spokesperson John Kirby said in Washington. “So—and this is a pattern we’ve seen, so we’re not going to react and respond to every bit of rhetoric,” he added. Kirby, who noted that Duterte’s rhetoric was “at odds” with the relationship between the two countries, also laughed off Duterte’s volatile attitude to that of his alter-egos and people speaking for him, which has been notably inconsistent. “And you’ve already seen cases where the President himself and even some of his Cabinet officials have walked back some of these statements,” Kirby said. “In fact, just today I’d point you to comments made by the President’s spokesman himself about the issue of businesses, where the President’s spokesman himself walked that back just today, that there’s no intention to harm the US-Philippines economic relationship or the presence of American businesses there. So even just in the wake of him saying it, his own spokesman walked that back,” he added. On Tuesday, the President resumed his anti-US rhetoric as he scored US State Department Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel by telling him that the US should not treat the Philippines “like a dog on a leash.” Duterte’s belligerent stance against the United States has unnerved another close ally, Japan, which is worried about China’s expansion of control over the South China Sea. In his visit to Beijing last week, Duterte promised the Chinese of his “separation” from Washington in the military and economic aspect, only to take back his statements upon arriving at Davao City, saying that he’s not severing our ties with the West.Shortly after making remarks to “separate” with the United States, his economic managers sought damage control, with Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia saying that the President “isn’t an English major” and Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez insisting that Duterte’s statements were “not realistic.” On Tuesday, Duterte likewise urged foreign businesses in the Philippines who are worried about his deadly war on drugs to “pack up and leave” the country, but Malacañang declined to make any comment to expound on the President’s statements. Washington and Tokyo are trying to counter Beijing’s encroachment in surrounding waters by forming partnerships with other territorial claimants in the region, such as the Philippines. Not toning down on his anti-American slur, Duterte instead gave a deadline of “two years” to free the country from foreign troops and abrogate executive agreements, if necessary, to make them happen. “I have declared that I will pursue an independent foreign policy. I want maybe in the next two years my country freed of the presence of foreign military troops,” the President said in Tokyo, as he detailed his ranting against the United States for criticizing him over his war on illegal drugs. “I want them out and if I have to revise or abrogate agreements, existing agreements, this will be the last maneuver war games between the United States and the Philippines military,” he said. Reiterating that the Americans had started the war by threatening to cut off US assistance as a result of human rights violations committed under his administration, Duterte said that America should not treat him “like a dog on a leash.” “The Americans are really a bully,” Duterte said. “You know, it’s like saying I am a dog on a leash and I said, if you do not stop biting the criminals, we will not throw the bread under your mouth. We will throw it further so that you’ll have to struggle to get it. That is what America wants me to be. A dog barking for the crumbs of their favor and so I said it’s a great country, it has helped us in so many ways in the past but you know and you must know that we are also under a colony of America for 50 years and they lived off the fat of my land,” he added. US Ambassador to the Philippines Philip Goldberg had earlier said that the US wanted to remain involved in Mindanao to campaign to quell Islamic militancy in Mindanao, citing that security threats in the conflict-plagued region were “very serious.” Duterte told Japanese businessmen if they want to come to the Philippines, “you’ll just have to contend with the new dynamics of my country.” He admitted that without the assistance of America, it will be a “lesser quality of life” for Filipinos, but maintain that the country will survive even without them. “We will survive without the assistance of America. Maybe a lesser quality of life but I said, we will survive and if there is one thing I would like to prove to America and to everybody, there is such a thing as the dignity of the Filipino people,” Duterte said.",0,,,"{'None': ['Southeast Asia'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Washington'], 'JPN': ['Japan', 'Tokyo'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Davao', 'Mindanaw'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'South China Basin']}",security_force_facility_presence,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing']
Philippines,12213,inquirer.net,2017-04-07T00:17:24Z,Duterte: Occupy PH islands in South China Sea,"PUERTO PRINCESA CITY—President Duterte on Thursday said he had ordered troops to deploy to and fortify unoccupied South China Sea islands and reefs claimed by the Philippines, a move that could provoke rival claimants, including China.
Mr. Duterte also announced that he may visit Pagasa Island, internationally known as Thitu Island, and raise the Philippine flag there on Independence Day, June 12.

The Philippines marks its 119th year of independence from more than three centuries of Spanish rule on June 12.
Taking what is ours
“It looks like everybody is making a grab for the islands there, so we better live on those that are still vacant,” Mr. Duterte told reporters during a visit to the headquarters of the Western Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan province, near the disputed Spratly archipelago.
China asserts sovereignty over almost all of the resource-rich South China Sea despite rival claims from the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan, and has rapidly built reefs into artificial islands capable of hosting military planes.
Mr. Duterte has previously sought to improve the Philippines’ relations with China by adopting a nonconfrontational approach to their competing claims.
He has deferred assertion of an international tribunal’s ruling in favor of the Philippines in a challenge to China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea and made overtures to Beijing that have led to improvement in relations between the two countries.
But he appeared to alter his tone with his announcement on Thursday, saying it was time to “erect structures there and raise the Philippine flag.”
He made clear, however, that he was not diverting from his administration’s stance of making “friends with everybody,” including China.
ADVERTISEMENT
He said the Philippines only sought to make sure it had a strong presence on the islands it occupied.
“We try to be friends with everybody, but we have to maintain our jurisdiction, at least [in] the areas that we control,” Mr. Duterte said.
“I have ordered the armed forces to occupy all these islands and put up the Philippine flag [there],” he said.
“This coming Independence Day, I may go to Pagasa to raise the flag. We want to make a strong point that that is ours,” he said.
Kalayaan Islands
Pagasa Island is the second-largest island in the Kalayaan group in the Spratlys occupied by the Philippines. It is located 480 kilometers west of Puerto Princesa City and is part of the municipality of Kalayaan.
Occupied by the Philippines since 1970, Pagasa is tightly protected by the military and the population is composed of soldiers and their families.
The island has a 1,300-meter airstrip and structures, including a municipal hall and an elementary school.
The military has requested funds to upgrade the runway on Pagasa and the living quarters of troops stationed there, but work on the improvements has been deferred in keeping with an agreement between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and China to maintain the status quo in the disputed South China Sea.
The agreement, however, did not stop China from building artificial islands on seven reefs in the Spratlys, including some claimed by the Philippines.
Philippine claims
Besides Pagasa Island, Philippines occupies Likas Island (West York Island), Parola Island (Northeast Cay), Lawak Island (Nanshan), Kota (Loaita Island), Panata Island (Lankiam Cay), Rizal Reef (Commodore Reef), Balagtas Reef (Irving Reef) and Ayungin Shoal (Second Thomas Shoal).
In addition, the Philippines claims Panganiban Reef (Mischief Reef), Zamora Reef (Subi Reef), Kagitingan Reef (Fiery Cross Reef), Calderon Reef (Cuarteron Reef), Burgos Reef (Gaven Reef), Mabini Reef (Johnson South Reef) and McKennan Reef (Hughes Reef), all of which are also claimed by China and Vietnam.
China has transformed Kagitingan, Calderon, Burgos, Mabini, Panganiban, Zamora and McKennan into artificial islands, and built facilities on some that could be used for military purposes, including runways, aircraft hangars and radar shelters.
Last month, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the military would strengthen its facilities in the Spratlys, building a new port, paving the airstrip on Pagasa and repairing other structures.
Mr. Duterte spoke about building fortifications on Ayungin Shoal, where the government grounded an old naval hospital ship, the BRP Sierra Madre, in 1999 to mark Philippine territory in the Spratlys.
A garrison of Marines holds the rusting ship, which Mr. Duterte indicated he wanted to transform into a battle-capable outpost.
“That’s ours. I must build bunkers there,” he said.
Philippine Ridge
Mr. Duterte said the development plan for the West Philippine Sea would include funding for securing the Philippines’ ownership of Benham Rise, a resource-rich undersea landmass off the eastern coast of Luzon.
“I will spend for the fortification, including Benham Rise, which I will rename Philippine Ridge, because it is part of our continental shelf,” he said.—WITH REPORTS FROM THE WIRES

But Duterte has not pressed the issue with Beijing, instead working to improve ties and attract billions of dollars in Chinese loans and investments. Duterte also attempted to calm worries in Japan over his trip to China, assuring his audience that he was not seeking military ties with Beijing, just a closer economic relationship. ""We did not talk about arms, we did not talk about stationing of troops,"" he said.

Philippines,4725,inquirer.net,2014-08-19T18:29:18Z,"2 Filipino students win gold, silver medals in China math tourney","MANILA, Philippines — Two young Filipino numbers aces have made the Philippines proud anew by winning two medals–a gold and a silver—in the just-ended 2014 China Western Mathematics Invitational (CWMI) competition, held Aug. 14 to 18 in Chongqing city, located in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan.
The good news was relayed to the Philippine Daily Inquirer on Monday night by Dr. Simon Chua, president of the non-government Mathematics Trainers’ Guild Philippines (MTG), which trained gold medalist Clyde Wesley Ang, a student of the Chiang Kai Shek College in Manila, and bronze medalist Albert John Patupat, a student of the Holy Rosary College in Sta. Rosa, Laguna.

Both Ang and Patupat bagged individual and team gold medals during last month’s Korea International Math Competition in Daejeon, South Korea.
In a text message, Chua said the Chinese team topped the nine-nation contest with a medal haul of four golds and four silvers.
Aside from the Philippines and host China, the other participating countries were Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Indonesia, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan.
Four other members of the Philippine team had backed out so they could take the University of the Philippines College Admission Test, or UPCAT.
Chua cited the two MTG wards, saying he was “very proud of their performance, considering this competition is one of the toughest in the region.”
This year’s CWMI contest was the 12th edition of the contest. After the suspension of the annual event in 2012, said to be due to Tibet-related issues, it was held again last year.

BULUAN, Maguindanao―The London Graduate School has honored Maguindanao Gov. Esmael Mangudadatu, the first Filipino in its short-list of honorees, as it recognized jim for championing education for children of families displaced by armed conflict. Sadiksha Rai, who heads the school’s Continuing Education Programs, said Mangudadatu is “among the persons selected in recognition of (his) achievement and contributions.” In her letter, Rai said the prestigious school conferred on Mangudadatu a Doctoral Degree in Public Administration, Honoris Causa, at Raintree Hotel Rolla Street in Bur, Dubai on Dec. 12. This brings honor not only to the province but also to Filipino Muslims, who constitute a small minority of the country’s population, said the governor’s younger brother, Maguindanao Rep. Zajid Mangudadatu. The governor is the lone Filipino so far among LGS award recipients. The school’s roster of illustrious awardees includes the late Singaporean statesman Lee Kwan Yew, former US President Barack Obama, Microsoft founder Billy Gates, the late Indira Gandhi of India, and Chinese President Xi Jinping.Mangudadatu said education is the only long-term solution to increasing concerns on the massive recruitment of young individuals into terror groups―some purportedly offering big amounts in cash. The governor has held a series of dialogues with students, orphans, and young professionals in the province. Students spoke to Mangudadatu about their learning experiences and on how the Maguindanao Peace (MagPeace) Study Grant Program helped them overcome the challenge of poverty, and eventually become professionals themselves. Nash B. MaulanaRamina Pandian, a young teacher, said she almost alost hope after surviving a motorcycle mishap, which crippled her for a time. But she said the MagPeace Scholarship Program lit her path with fresh motivation to finish her college education and become the young school teacher she is now. The province’s pilot program for children with special needs has also held a series of workshops for 29 children with special needs. The United Nations defines Children with special needs as children “(who) may have mild learning disabilities or profound cognitive impairment; they may have food allergies or a terminal illness. A child’s special needs may include developmental delays that catch up quickly or remain entrenched.” Article 23 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that children who have any kind of disability “have the right to special care and support, as well as all the rights in the Convention, so that they can live full and independent lives.” Mangudadatu said dozens more of Maguindanao children orphaned by armed conflict needed institutional guidance to see a brighter future. “These children should be exposed to the real world. Their only way through freedom from the perils of violence is education,” Mangudadatu said, as he and Maguindanao employees watched orphans enjoy the presence of the popular mascot of a fastfood chain. LGS is the administrator of several universities, colleges and professional institutes, including the Commonwealth Academy of Leadership and Management, London and the Commonwealth University (London Centre), Rai said in a letter to Mangudadatu.",0,,,"{'USA': ['United States', 'London'], 'IND': ['Republic of India', 'Dubai'], 'PHL': ['Mangudadatu', 'Province of Maguindanao']}",professional_cultural_exchange,['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping']
Philippines,18341,mb.com.ph,2018-10-16T13:33:56Z,Political Parties Conference in Moscow; world needs wise men; need to complete joint program with China on drilling in West Philippine Sea,"PEACE-MAKER
By FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER JOSE C. DE VENECIA JR.
We are off next week to preside at the October 24-27 10th General Assembly of the International Conference of Asian Political Parties (ICAPP) in Moscow, now composed of more than 340 ruling, opposition, and independent parties in Asia, with expected guests from political groups from Europe, Africa, North America, Latin America and Australasia.
The Moscow meeting on October 24-27 will be immediately followed by a Special Workshop in Seoul, South Korea, on Green Cities, October 30-November 2, being organized by former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, now Chairman of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), former South Korean Ambassador to Russia Park Rob-yug, now our ICAPP Secretary-General based in Seoul, and by the undersigned as ICAPP Founding Chairman and Chairman of the ICAPP Standing Committee.
For the Moscow conference, following our earlier meetings in Vladivostok in the last three years, on vast Russia’s eastern frontier on the Pacific coast, we told Russian Ambassador to Manila Igor Khovaev last week that we are still writing our speech and hope to seek counsel from our other Russian friends, Senator Andrey Klimov, Russian board member in our 35-man ICAPP Standing Committee, and our former ICAPP board member, Konstantin Koshachev, who is well regarded by the Russian leadership and adviser to President Putin.
However as a friend to Russia, it is our hope that the U.S., China, and the major powers in the European Union who were Allies during World War II, that it might be a good idea in our opening speech to devote some time to recall the great glory days of World War II, when Russia under Joseph Stalin, the U.S. under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, England under Winston Churchill, Nazi-occupied France led from the outside by Gen. Charles de Gaulle, China under President Chiang Kai-shek, followed later by Mao Tze Tung and Deng Hsiao Peng, with the Philippines, as a Commonwealth then, not yet independent but allied with the U.S., led the Allies into victory and slowly but steadily lifted the world from the ashes of devastation.
Would it not be a good idea then if some wise men, retired senior leaders and movers of public opinion and civil society today in both East and West would call on the leaders now of the allied World War II nations and their former enemies, but today, their staunch allies, Japan, Germany and Italy, in a genuine global alliance in concert with and under United Nations aegis, to continuously work, without deadline, on a long-term global agenda for peace.
Impossible dream, maybe, but the optimists and the students of history believe that the work must continuously go on and the dream should never die.
*****
And last week, before his scheduled departure as Secretary of Foreign Affairs to run for Congressman in the House of Representatives as a prelude to his announced eventual run for Speaker of the House next year, we suggested that Alan Peter Cayetano might finalize with President Rodrigo Duterte an understanding with Chinese President Xi Jinping on a likely Joint Exploration and Development Program in the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea), as the highlight of several agreements with China during President Xi’s scheduled official visit to Manila in November.
We believe the South China Sea area off Palawan and below the Spratlys with now multiple claimants, could be expected to yield significant volumes of natural gas and/or crude oil, which could easily be pumped and shipped to nearby refineries in the Philippines and Southern China as against the expensive back-and-forth long journeys of huge tankers across the Straits of Malacca, the Gulf of Thailand, the Indian Ocean, the Straits of Hormuz and into the Persian Gulf (Arab Gulf) to lift crude in Saudi Arabia or United Arab Emirates or Kuwait for refineries in the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan.
As President of the Petroleum Association of the Philippines for more than ten years and having helped discover and develop the first Philippine offshore oil wells in the 1970s in the Northwest Palawan Sea (the Nido and Masinloc oil wells for our companies then, Basic Petroleum and Landoil, together with our partners, Oriental Petroleum, Philippine Overseas and the U.S. companies), it is urgent and important that the Philippines under President Duterte and incoming Secretary Locsin might now direct the completion of negotiations with Chinaand schedule the first, long-anticipated joint-venture Filipino and Chinese offshore drilling in the sea, most likely, we would guess, in the Reed Bank of the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea).
In a previous recent column, we conjectured that a successful oil discovery in the South China Sea by a Filipino-Chinese joint venture or consortium will dramatically reduce or put to an end the possibilities of explosive conflict in the area.
When we were Speaker of the House of Representatives and founding Chairman of the International Conference of Asian Political Parties (ICAPP) in the year 2000, we accompanied then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on her first state visit to China, which coincided with the Third Biennial Conference of the ICAPP (now representing some 300 ruling, opposition, and independent political parties in Asia) held in Beijing. To take advantage of the happy occasion in the Chinese capital, we proposed to the President that we negotiate and sign a Joint Oil Seismic agreement with China in the South China Sea which she then and there approved, and together, we immediately presented the idea to our host, the China President Hu Jintao, who heartily gave his approval.
After we left the Chinese President for another meeting, we thought of another potential winner, and proposed that we include the other claimant in the South China Sea, Vietnam, for a Tripartite Agreement.
The Chinese President then smiled and gave his immediate assent, and then both Presidents Hu Jintao and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo then turned around and looked at me, to undertake a special mission to convince the Vietnamese to be the Third Signatory, in what was to become a Tripartite Seismic Agreement, preparatory to drilling. After another day in Beijing with wife Gina, then President Arroyo and the First Gentleman Mike Arroyo returned to Manila after a most productive visit to China.
At home, after a quick check with our office in Congress, we hurriedly motored to the airport for our next journey to Hanoi to convince the Vietnamese to co-sign what would become the Tripartite Seismic Agreement in the South China Sea.
We were not apprehensive of our Hanoi visit. While Vietnam was the third claimant in the isles, sand cays, coral reefs, and the tiny areas in the South China Sea, obviously also for hydrocarbons, we were also of the belief that friendship in ASEAN and realpolitik would insure that Hanoi would co-sign a tripartite seismic pact.
In Hanoi, we met with both the past and the current Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) General Secretary, Nguyeh Duc Manh and Nguyen Phu Throng, respectively, who are our old friends, and both actually higher in rank than Vietnam’s President or Prime Minister under their hierarchical system. We had the other good fortune that Vietnam’s capable Deputy Foreign Minister was also a graduate of our De La Salle College, where we finished high school, and as with the Vietnam Speaker, we were on first-name basis.
We went home with Vietnam’s agreement our tripartite Philippines-China-Vietnam venture, hopefully a precursor of the anticipated eventual common oil exploration and development agreement in the South China Sea. The costs of the detailed wide-ranging Seismic Survey in the sea were to be jointly shared by the three governments.
The subsequent seismic survey findings indicated a number of attractive drillable structures, which would most likely bear hydrocarbons (oil and/or gas) below the sea, and which can only be tested by strategraphic tests: direct drilling by expensive exploration below the sea bed conducted by modern drillships.
In earlier days and up to now, the best and biggest drillships and semi-submersibles at the time were those built and owned by the Americans; most of the offshore drilling were in the North Sea, in the U.S. West Coast, in the Gulf of Mexico, and in the Alaskan coast.
A few years ago, while on a visit to southern China, our friends in the offshore oil exploration industry, spoke of giant Chinese drillships and drilling platforms, some on standby off Fujian or Guangdong waters or near Hainan island.
Instead of hiring U.S. or Western drillships, which would have to sail great distances to reach potential drilling sites in the South China Sea, it would indeed be prudent and less expensive, if any first joint Filipino-Chinese oil-drilling venture in the China Sea would engage the huge Chinese offshore drillships parked nearby. The exploration costs and drillship rentals will be cheaper and shared, and in any Filipino-Chinese oil drilling partnership, the most likely operator would be a Chinese oil company partner, most likely government-owned, and which would engage on contract the Chinese oil-drilling ship.
This would be the likely scenario if our astute Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano or equally brilliant, rumoured successor Teodoro “Teddyboy” Locsin, the incumbent Philippine Ambassador to the U.N., finalizes an Oil Exploration Agreement with China with a commitment to drill a number of offshore wells in the South China Sea and which, we would guess, would result in substantial oil discoveries that could dramatically reduce our huge annual oil bill and almost total dependence on Arabian crude oil.
These outcomes would immediately be beneficial to the Philippines and China because the crude oil or natural gas could immediately be shipped to Philippine or Chinese refineries nearby unlike hydrocarbons discovered in distant seas like those on the Persian Gulf.
Presumably, any agreement with China will comply with the Philippine Constitution, which reserves the Philippines’ natural resources for exploitation and use by Filipinos, if the drilling is conducted in the old Filipino Petroleum Exploration Concession (PEC), but Chinese and/or foreign participation is allowed and encouraged under the current Service Contracts.
The Filipino-Chinese exploration agreement will most likely designate an “Operator,” as in all Western or Eastern oil exploration agreements. One of the partners will undertake the management of the drilling operation designated as “Operator” with the costs shared by the parties, with obviously the manager-operator given an extra fee. The operator could also be the Filipino partner but unlikely because management of the drilling will be undertaken by the operator.
The much larger work will commence when oil is struck and the huge problems of development begin: raising huge finance, building pipelines in the sea all the way to on-land destinations, or loading more crude on tankers destined to farther ports in China or the Philippines or for third-party buyers.",1,,,"{'None': ['Asia', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'North America', 'Strait of Malacca', 'Gulf of Thailand', 'Indian Ocean', 'Persian Gulf'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'Fujian Sheng', 'Hainan Sheng'], 'KOR': ['Republic of Korea', 'Seoul'], 'RUS': ['Russian Federation', 'Moscow', 'Vladivostok'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Gulf', 'North Sea', 'South China', 'Pelican', 'Virginia City Cemeteries', 'Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial', 'Great Gulf'], 'FRA': ['Republic of France', 'Isles-lès-Villenoy'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Province of Palawan'], 'JPN': ['Japan'], 'DEU': ['Federal Republic of Germany'], 'ITA': ['Italian Republic'], 'SAU': ['Kingdom of Saudi Arabia'], 'ARE': ['United Arab Emirates'], 'KWT': ['State of Kuwait'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan'], 'VNM': ['Socialist Republic of Vietnam', 'Hanoi', 'South China Sea'], 'GBR': ['England']}",professional_cultural_exchange,"['Moscow', 'China']",['China'],['China'],['China']

Philippines,4927,inquirer.net,2014-09-09T17:06:38Z,"Asean media urged to practice ‘peaceful, constructive journalism’","BEIJING — A Communication University of China official has urged Asean journalists to promote “constructive and peaceful journalism” amid territorial disputes in the South China Sea.
Liu Chang, dean of School of Journalism at the Chinese state university, said the media should not foment discord but serve as a channel for better understanding and cooperation.
ADVERTISEMENT
Liu, however, said his communication paradigm should not be seen as transforming media groups into a propaganda machine churning out deodorized news and information.
Instead, he told journalists and media executives from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations that when reporting conflicts, journalists should also be able to offer solutions.
China and at least two Asean members–the Philippines and Vietnam–remain locked in territorial disputes over the South China Sea.
Beijing seeks to allay fears in Asean as it strengthens its economic and military clout in the region. One way to do this, an official said, is for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to engage in what it calls “e-public diplomacy.”
From August 30 to September 6, 20 Southeast Asian journalists and media executives and two officials of the Asean Secretariat joined the China-Asean Journalists Exchange Program held in Beijing and Zhejiang.
The eight-day study tour saw Asean journalists exchanging views with prominent members of the Chinese media, academe, local government officials and executives of leading business groups.
The program was facilitated by Zhu Xiaozhong, deputy director of E-Public Diplomacy Division; Wu Shenghao, first secretary of the Public Diplomay Office; and Tian Qi, information staff of the Public Diplomacy office, all from the foreign affairs ministry.
The Asean member nations—Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam—are formally integrating as an economic bloc in 2015.

This grand initiative, fortunately, received unequivocal support from the UN, which in a resolution last year urged all member states to join it and protect its overseas operation,” he added.Wang said that with such ties, developing economies “can pursue the development path that suits them best,” hence, rectifying the direction of globalization.In December 2017, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia told reporters that at least eight infrastructure projects under President Rodrigo Duterte’s “Build, Build, Build” program have been lined up for possible funding by Beijing alone.“These have been prioritized as a result of a high-level meeting between the Philippine government and the Chinese government last September 27, 2017,” he previously said.Some priority projects underway include the Subic-Clark Railway Project, Panay-Guimaras-Negros Island Bridges, Safe Philippines Project, Davao-Samal Island Bridges Project, Davao International Airport Development, Agus-6 Unit Major Rehabilitation Project, Agus-3 Hydroelectric Plant and Ilocos Norte Irrigation Project Phase 2.Duterte himself had admitted in his previous speeches that China is an “important ingredient” in his Build, Build, Build program.“China is a very important ingredient here... Every day the cost of money goes up. That is the problem. We will have pricing today far different from last week. I would say I need China more than anybody else at this time,” he said in a speech in April.“China is dedicated in its responsibility as a rising major power to hear the countries out and help.

SANTOSFOLLOWING the Asian, European and American developments over the past three weeks, the immediate and intermediate future for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) looks pregnant with opportunities for economic progress and relaxation of military-political tensions in the Asia-Pacific region.This is obvious at least to some of our fellow members in the private, non-government and non-sectarian think tanks, the Philippine Center for Philippine Futuristics Studies (Futuristics Center) and the Philippine Council of Foreign Relations (PCFR).In anticipation of the transition of the American political leadership from the Obama to the Donald J. Trump presidency (with the inauguration of President Donald J. Trump last Friday, Washington D.C. time), Chinese President Xi Jinping used the World Economic Forum (WEF) a week earlier to announce that Beijing would actively support and finance international deals to hasten development in poor—developing and underdeveloped—countries.From where I sit, clearly it was a smart propaganda move—salesmanship if you wish—on China’s part. Xi was trying to convince the world that China’s One Belt, One Road (OBOR) foreign policy is better than that of any of the superpowers. It was launched when Xi took over as chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and its ruling Central Committee (Politburo), commander-in-chief of the Peoples Liberation Army and China’s President three years ago.It was not really hard to guess that Xi, who had consolidated his absolute control of his country’s leadership, would probably do exactly what he did in Davos because the free American media and international news networks had openly covered the US presidential campaign throughout.Trump had campaigned to bring back home to the US investments and businesses overseas to generate incomes for the increased (under the eight-year Obama regime) jobless Americans, resuscitate the declining economy (now threatened by China’s economic surge over the last 30 years, though slowing down now), restore defense spending to boost its technical and striking powers over Russia and China, and raze the international terrorist extremist Islamic State.In short, President Trump won on the promise of better life for Americans at home and to maintain US hegemony, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, which has been weakened with the budgetary cuts down to $500 billion annually during Obama’s two-term regime.On the other hand China had been increasing its armed forces expenditures up to the $500 billion mark—and built its first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning--since it overtook Japan as the world’s second (to the US) economic power two years ago.This situation, plus the continuous aggressive Chinese military buildup in the South China Sea--including in the West Philippine Sea which is part of the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone under the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)--has intensified geopolitical-military tensions in the Asia-Pacific region.Thus, the need for China now to boost its diplomatic offensive and use the economic capability and financial resources it has amassed to attract more allies from its immediate neighbors in Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa.Apparently, China has given up the Northeast Asia region dominated by US allies Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (which China considers its renegade province but with its own military and economic resources and government).The recent Pacific Ocean run of the Liaoning, from its Dalian home base in northeastern China, and passing close to the Taiwan territorial waters (before last week’s Trump inauguration), was an indication that China was testing how the new Republican Party regime in Washington would react to Chinese military initiatives.We in the ASEAN 10 probably will not have to wait long to find out.Europe is undergoing a painful divorce process with the United Kingdom, undertaking the two-year negotiation to complete Brexit, and Britain’s cessation of its dealing with the European Union. London will undoubtedly depend on its British Commonwealth (of former colonies, which is the biggest single group of economic allies) for its economic competitiveness and survival.One of the anticipated negative impacts of Brexit, as financial institutions have so far aired, is the devaluation of the pound against the other currencies in the international market as demand for the British pound will diminish with the immediate slide of its economy. But look at it from the other side. A devalued pound will make it tougher for the British manufacturers to import raw materials, but exporters will benefit because it can get more pound for its sale to other countries. And British factories can depend on its Commonwealth members (like Malaysia, Myanmar, India, in Asia) plus the Middle Eastern countries for raw materials.Another possibility is for British factories to relocate in the Commonwealth member countries for cheaper labor, power and overall production costs--and in the medium and long run, earn better for their exports.To be affected most by Trump’s call for American investors to return home is China, where US manufacturers migrated more than a decade back) because of low labor (no strikes as ordered by the Communist Party) power (using cheap but highly polluting dirty coal) and overall production costs. Beijing created its five free economic zones in its southeastern province facing the South China Sea.China’s biggest export market is the US. Effectively, the Chinese economic rise has been driven by the average American consumer who wants cheap goods when and where he wants them. Beijing will be grossly affected if and when Trump succeeds in incentivizing the American investors to come home. One negative economic factor immediately will be labor costs as American average incomes are higher than most of the world’s. But expect innovative thinking and management savvy of the Americans to go for more robotics, including drones, to save on manpower costs. They have and control most of the technologies in these fieldsThe risk of another world war is far more remote unless one miscalculating military field commander fires the first shot because the biggest consideration now is the economy. The reconstruction after the war will be costlier than the destruction. Top priority of the world’s seven billion plus population—and the United Nations’ too--is still eradication of extreme poverty. Just go through last week’s special feature of the Associated Press. Eight of the world’s billionaires hold the valued assets of half of the world’s population!This present global picture looks more like the third Cold War where the tools used are all in the fields of trade, financing, education, demography, technologies, and the environment (climate change)—for hegemonic competition. The active leaders expectedly are the US and China with Russia a smiling bystander who will pick up the pieces and take over from the loserThe first Cold War began when the Russian (Bolshevik) Revolution massacred the Romanov family in 1917. That actually began the ideological conflict between communism and capitalism—impoverished labor versus management and the rich.The second began in the 1960s with the arms and space race with communism losing with the destruction of the Berlin Wall and the eventual dissolution of the Soviet empire (by Premier Mikael Gorbachev who realized military spending yields zero return on investment). Remember his 1985 Vladivostok speech for glasnost and perestroika?This Cold War today looks tame but it is more deadly as food and water security kills slowly and more painfully than bullets, bombs and other explosives. And the global warming caused by environmental degradation and carbon emissions will predictably sink 30 percent of the world’s urban areas.We still have to see how Trump will manage to convert into reality his campaign promises.But for the ASEAN 10, all these “challenges” or risks have the equivalent opportunities for progress. It is just a matter of the political-economic leaderships empowering their people by providing the quality education for logistics or resources managers because all the ASEAN members are rich in natural resources, including the demographics. Keep in cadence with diplomacy and information technologies with the global community.On top of it all, be best informed of current conditions and see the future—the key to survival in this age.Comments and reactions may be emailed to gilshj99ph@yahoo.com.

Philippines,5661,inquirer.net,2015-03-15T03:14:02Z,Antonio’s officially joins list of Asia’s 50 best,"Chef Tonyboy Escalante’s Antonio’s Restaurant in Tagaytay officially joined the prestigious list of the Diner’s Club Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants last Monday, March 9, at the awards ceremony held in Singapore.
“I am motivated now more than ever, although I never pressured myself to win any of these awards. I’ve always just strived to get better at my craft for myself,” Escalante said in an interview.

Leading the list of Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants this year is Thailand’s Gaggan, which snatched the No. 1 spot from David Thompson’s Nahm, which slipped to No. 7.
Gaggan opened his eponymous restaurant in Bangkok in 2010 and has made waves for reinvigorating Indian cuisine using modern techniques and molecular twists.
It debuted on the list at No. 17 but climbed to No. 3 last year.
Thailand claims top spots
Thailand performed very well this year with the following restaurants also making the list: Nahm (No. 7), Eat Me (No. 25), Bo.Lan (No. 37) and Issaya Siamese Club (No. 39).
Now you know where to eat when you head to Bangkok, aside from trying its amazing streetfood.
Narisawa maintained its spot at No. 2, although only eight restaurants from Japan made it this year.
Shanghai’s Ultraviolet by Paul Pairet climbed to No. 3 as Hong Kong’s Amber slid down to No. 6.
Meanwhile, 10 restaurants from Singapore made the list, led by Restaurant Andre, which climbed a notch to No. 5.

I was able to eat at Restaurant Andre on this trip, which set our group of four back 430 SGD each.
“Mas mahal pa dinner natin dito sa airfare natin!” (Our dinner is more expensive than our plane tickets), joked Chef Myrna Segismundo, who joined the food trip.
Chef Andre Chiang, by the way, will be participating in Madrid Fusion Manila this coming April.
He will give a talk at the Congress in SMX.
Singapore restaurants
Other Singapore restaurants on the list: Burnt Ends made the list for the first time (where Chef Jessie Sincioco’s nephew Jeff Claudio works the kitchen under the leadership of the hip and happening chef David Pynt). Tippling Club, run by Australian Chef Ryan Clift, formerly of Vue de Monde, the only Melbourne restaurant in 2007 to make it to the World’s 50 Best Restaurants, joined the list at No. 36. And Osteria Mozza, which proudly has an all-Filipino service team and whose pizzeria sibling is run by Filipina Chef Karla Mendoza, made a comeback.
By the way, if you find yourself in Singapore, check out One Farrer Hotel in Little India. It just opened last year, is sleek and spacious, and has its own MRT stop.
Congratulations to all the restaurants and chefs who made it, especially to Chef Tonyboy Escalante, who has once again brought pride to the Philippines.

Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles and Chinese Embassy Economic and Commercial Counsellor Jiang Jianjun agreed to attend and speak in a forum on China’s growing global role and expanding influence in developing countries such as the Philippines.
Jiang, in behalf of Ambassador Zhao Jianhua, and Nograles will lead the discussions with their thoughts on the new world order which has gained much attention in this region and other continents.
Martin Jacques, author of the best-seller “When China Rules the World: the End of the Western World and the Birth of a New Global Order”, will keynote the event organized and co-presented by the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) and the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines (COMP). Filipino and foreign businessmen based here in Manila, and most of the members of either chamber, are very keen in understanding China which is now at the forefront of trade and investments.
Rocky Dimaculangan, Vice President for Communication of the Chamber of Mines, noted that the country’s mineral resource industry is currently very dependent on its trade with China as the majority of the mining exports to the Asian powerhouse. Several members go to the PCCI, on the other hand, are wary of being caught between the United States and China and their on-going trade and tariff discussions.
PCCI and COMP are pleased that Mr. Jacques has agreed to come back to Manila after his speaking engagement here in 2012. It is very timely for the country’s business sector to revisit the discussion on China’s role especially in the region. Jacques is credited for having foretold the ascendancy of China as a world power 10 years ago. He is a fellow at the Department of Politics and International Studies at Cambridge University and was a visiting professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
Some 350 business, government, and media leaders are expected to attend the discussion on September 10 at the Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila'], 'USA': ['United States']}",professional_cultural_exchange,"['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China', 'Chinese']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,15894,manilatimes.net,2018-04-22T00:06:29Z,Bringing 'Binondo' to the musical stage,"Although the Philippines has never been a colony of China, the influence of what is considered the largest nation and one of the oldest civilizations in the world on Filipino life is very much prevalent—from food selections to Chinese New Year celebration and following feng shui practices.Influential they may be in Filipino culture, the Chinese have not had an ample share of good portrayals in Philippine theater.“Usually Chinese characters are just playing support and sometimes they even take the roles of antagonists [or butt of jokes],” award-winning screenwriter and playwright Ricky Lee noted.It is this common mold reserved for Chinese that Lee and his creative partners including director Joel Lamangan, co-writers Gershom Chua, Eljay Castro Deldoc, musical director Von De Guzman and choreographer Douglas Nierras want to break in the stage production “Binondo: A Tsinoy Musical” which opens at The Theatre at Solaire on June 29.“This time, ‘Binondo’ will be from the perspective of Chinese, sila naman ang focus sa isang play ngayon,” the master storyteller behind iconic works such as “Himala” and “Anak” among many others added during the grand media launch of the musical.“We are proud to say that Binondo is actually the first musical that tackles the lives of Tsinoys [Chinese-Filipinos],” TV, film and theater director Lamangan whose latest foray in theater was the musical adaptation of “Maynila Sa Kuko Ng Liwanag,” added.Binondo: A Tsinoy Musical tells the story of how Lily, a Filipina night club singer in pre-Martial Law Philippines, and Ah Tiong, a mainland Chinese scholar returning to Cultural Revolution-era Beijing, embark on a journey of great love and heartbreak that begins one fated, moonlit night during the Mid-Autumn Festival of 1971 in the heart of Manila’s Chinatown.Lily, a hopeless romantic, finally finds her unlikely great love in Ah Tiong, a cynic about destiny, during this night of one of the fullest moons ever recorded.Vying for Lily’s heart as well is Carlos, a local Chinese childhood friend of hers who is finally pushed to confront his feelings for her with the arrival of this stranger set on stealing her heart.Spanning two decades and two countries, the musical explores how love overcomes even times of racial prejudice and political turmoil and endures years of waiting and absence, only to grow deeper and change the lives of everyone who dares to put their hearts on the line.“But ‘Binondo’ is not a purely love story, it has social context,” Lee clarified.An all-original musical produced out of the collaboration of SYNERGY 88, Rebecca Chuaunsu Film Production (RCFP) and Fullhouse Asia Production Studios, Inc., it is an original story from one of its proponents, Rebeca Chuaunsu.“In 1986, my parents—both journalists who have written plays and operas in their lifetime—brought me to China to trace my roots. There, I met a Chinese professor who told me his life story, his love story and his struggles of survival during the Cultural Revolution in China,” Chuaunsu recalled during the media launch.“As such, for the past 32 years, I’ve kept his touching story in my heart. But never in my wildest dreams have I thought that my idols, the iconic writer Ricky Lee and director Joel Lamangan would actually bring this story to life,” Chuaunsu recalled.Backing his idols' claim that Binondo is more than just a love story, Chuaunsu assured that the musical will also give light to their race’s issues that are not commonly tackled.“We are what we call the second generation Chinese. Our parents are from Mainland China, they are both immigrants in the Philippines. So throughout our childhood and teenage years, we always have this cultural identity—am I Chinese? Am I Filipino? Or am I half-Chinese and half-Filipino? So we try to address this issue.“Having both Chinese and Filipino character, in the story, we try to see the positivity and learn the best of the two cultures while attempting to bridge the gap between them.”Giving life to these new characters are the country’s top thespians Shiela Valderrama Martinez and Carla Guevara Laforteza alternately playing Lily; Arman Ferrer and David Ezra as Ah Tiong; and Floyd Tena and Noel Rayos as Carlos.Also included in the cast are Yela Laurel (Jasmine); Ashlee Factor (Ruby); Ima Castro (Mrs. Dela Rosa); Ana Feleo and Jennifer Villegas (Lourdes); Kay Balajadia and Jennifer Villegas (Mrs. Chua); Dondi Ong (Mr. Chua); Russell Magno (Mr. Zhang); Elizabeth Chua (Mrs. Zhang); and Jim Pebanco, Lorenz Martinez.

Philippines,5603,inquirer.net,2015-02-07T15:08:29Z,New Apec scholarship initiative allows cross-border education,"CLARK FREEPORT ZONE, Philippines— The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) launched a “scholarship initiative” to allow greater access to cross-border education in the Asia-Pacific region among its 21-member economies during the first day of the Senior Officials’ meeting at the Fontana Convention hall on Friday in Clark, Pampanga.
“The initiative aggregates sponsored study and career development exchanges offered by universities and companies in Apec member economies and supports the creation of new opportunities by facilitating coordination among government, higher learning institution and companies in the region,” Apec said in a statement.

John F. Kerry, Secretary of State of the United States said in a statement that “a well-educated, well-trained and well connected workforce is critical to ensuring long-term growth and prosperity on both sides of the Pacific.”
“Together, Apec and the private sector are opening the gates of opportunity to provide more of the region’s three billion people the knowledge, skills and experience they need to thrive in a 21st century marketplace,” Kerry said.
The Apec scholarship Initiative was introduced during a meeting of Apec trade ministers in China in May 2014 and was endorsed by the Apec leaders in Beijing in November 2014 during the 22nd Apec summit.
“Our goal is to maximize oppurtunities afforded by globalization to strengthen people’s employability and earning potential,” said Dr. Allan Bollard, executive director of the Apec secretariat.
“We are particularly intent on empowering the youth and women to narrow economic inequalities and drive new growth,” Bollard added.
According to Bollard, “broadening access to education training and skills are needed to mitigate the threat of skilled labor shortages due tto the unfolding demographic changes around Asia-Pacific, namely aging population and lower birthrates”
“Candidates with overseas experience are in many cases viewed more favorably by firms seeking future leaders with a global outlook,” he said.
He said nurturing a more skilled and mobile workforce is beneficial for people’s career development, which is good for employers and for economic growth.
“Economic empowerment promotes a virtuous cycle of greater productivity, the creation of higher quality, higher paying jobs and more prosperous and equitable societies, which is what we are all aspiring to achieve,” he said.

The Metro Manila Chinese Education Association convened its 2023-2024 annual meeting on April 5 to 6 at Canyon Woods Resort Club in Batangas.
Around 100 teachers from 22 Chinese schools in Metro Manila attended the event.
Association president Cai Lisha believes that holding the annual meeting will enable member schools to connect with one other.
“It is commendable to see member schools persevering through the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and undertaking teaching reforms to elevate Chinese education to a more proficient and impactful level. I firmly believe that the remarkable achievements of Chinese schools can be attributed to the dedication and diligence of our hardworking teachers,” said Tsai Lisha.
Philippine Chinese Education Research Center chairman Huang Duanming commended everyone for continuing their teaching profession especially during the pandemic period.
“Chinese education in the Philippines has a long-standing history, with some schools having reached the impressive milestone of 100 years. I hope everyone keeps focused on running schools seriously, stays curious to research, remains dedicated to teaching rigorously, and strives to provide high quality Chinese education,” he said.
Cai Yi Shu, vice chairman of the association and vice principal of the Philippine Cultural College, served as the keynote speaker for the inaugural training seminar.
She underscored the importance of educators upholding a high standard of professional ethics.
“The essential qualities for educators include passion, dedication, benevolence, persistence, justice, inclusion, gratitude, and a cheerful demeanor. It is very important to provide children equal opportunities and we, educators should be positive role models.” Cai Yi Shu said.
Cai Huimin, the primary school head of the Chinese Department at Overseas Chinese College, noted the importance of following five crucial steps in Chinese classroom teaching: organizing instruction, reviewing material, introducing new lessons, reinforcing learning, and assigning homework.
Yang Meimei, vice president of the Philippine Chinese Education Research Center served as the speaker during the third seminar. She talked about the theoretical basis for the design of the Chinese character courses and introduced the book Philippine Chinese Character Reading Textbook.

The 1914 Gotiaoco Building in MC Briones Street, across Cebu City Hall is envisioned to be the premier showcase of Chinese-Cebuano heritage and culture with “well-researched exhibitions and collections”.
Fr. Ben Sim, president of Sacred Heart Parish, said the idea of creating the museum is a big help in educating Chinese-Cebuanos and to promote culture and integration.
“The present generation, the ethnic Chinese, are not even familiar with the history of their ancestors. We cannot talk about integrating culture if they do not actually know what culture they came from. Coming with the idea of a museum will educate them,” Fr. Sim said.
The Gotiaoco Building was built in 1914 by businessman Pedro Gotiaoco, who made a big economic impact in Cebu during his time. He is the forefather of the Gokongweis, the Gotianuys, the Gotianuns and Gaisanos.
Under the MOA, the National Museum as custodian and manager, grants exclusive use of the property to the foundation for 25 years and may renew the arrangement for another 25 years.
The museum project would be the biggest outside Metro Manila. /Reporter Joy Cherry Quito and Eileen Mangubat

Philippines,40820,manilastandard.net,2024-05-08T10:10:00Z,Binondo’s rich legacy explored at Chinatown Museum,"- Advertisement -
Binondo, established in 1594, became a cultural melting pot as Chinese immigrants brought their traditions, customs and beliefs. Over the centuries, it has evolved into a thriving commercial center, attracting traders, artisans and entrepreneurs from around the globe.
Its strategic location along the Pasig River made it a vital link in the global trade network, facilitating the exchange of goods and ideas between Asia, Europe and the Americas.
To integrate arts, culture, history and heritage into its developments with Lucky Chinatown as the focal point, property developer Megaworld Corp. opened the country’s first cultural museum dedicated to Binondo’s rich history – the Chinatown Museum.
The museum, on the fourth floor of Lucky Chinatown’s north wing along Reina Regente Street, is recognized by the National Historical Commission and National Commission for Culture and the Arts as a community space and heritage project. It visually retells the area’s rich history.
Upon entering, visitors are immediately immersed in a world of discovery. The stories of the past come alive through a meticulously curated collection of artifacts, artworks and interactive exhibits.
The museum comprises 18 galleries that highlight key events influencing Binondo’s cultural, social and economic landscape. It explores the area’s evolution from a settlement of Christianized Chinese to a vibrant commercial hub in colonial Manila.
After purchasing tickets, visitors are greeted with a short video presentation on Binondo’s history and other details about the place. An interactive map showcasing historical and current street names also welcomes them.
The history of Binondo Church, also known as the Minor Basilica and National Shrine of Saint Lorenzo Ruiz, is displayed. The Spanish government encouraged the Chinese to convert by offering social and economic privileges. Social integration was symbolized by a new haircut.
The Chinese Pagoda exhibit replicates the annual fluvial procession of San Nicolas de Tolentino, patron saint of Chinese mestizos. Starting from Binondo, it travels via the Pasig River to Guadalupe.
Another gallery is devoted to the Alcaiceria, which translates to “Silk Market.” The Real Alcaiceria de San Fernando was built in 1752 following a royal decree by Ferdinand VI. Items on display include housewares, textiles and various commodities traded during that time.
A dark and dingy representation of an opium den is also featured. Opium dens were establishments where opium was sold and smoked.
The museum highlights the diverse industries of the era. Among the exhibits is a faithful reproduction of an antique bed from Eduardo Athay’s Taller de Carpenteria, offering a glimpse into the craftsmanship of the time.
Binondo’s industrial history, including tobacco factories, is showcased. One wall displays cigar covers from Edward de los Santos’ private collection, while the opposite side focuses on La Insular Cigar and Cigarette Factory.
A corner is dedicated to the Esteros de Binondo, which played an important role in trade and commerce. The canals facilitated the transport of goods such as bananas and coconuts.
The Chinatown Museum’s allure extends beyond multimedia presentations. Interactive exhibits, like one that transports visitors back in time to a traditional botica, or pharmacy, truly captivate visitors.
The Botica de San Fernando features a Chinese medicine cabinet where visitors can see and smell different herbs used by the apothecary.
Binondo’s reputation as a culinary hotspot is also reflected within the museum walls. Visitors can learn about the district’s culinary treasures like dim sum, pancit, and even tablea.
The Panaderia gallery is adorned with incredibly lifelike food props, inviting visitors to immerse themselves in the world of traditional delights like hopia, buchi, and siopao.
As visitors continue exploring, a captivating centerpiece awaits: a meticulously crafted scale model of a horse-drawn tranvia, offering a glimpse into Manila’s past transportation.
Additional galleries spotlight various aspects of Binondo’s historical significance. One exhibit showcases Escolta’s transformation into the nation’s premier hub for shopping, dining and entertainment by the 1870s.
Another highlights the establishment of Binondo as the home to the country’s first banks, including Standard Chartered Bank, Bank of the Philippine Islands, and Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp. Additionally, visitors can explore El 82, Ramon Ongpin’s hardware and art supplies shop, along with exhibits commemorating the Philippine revolution, a period marked by growing Filipino dissent against Spanish rule.
As Binondo continues to evolve, the Chinatown Museum remains a steadfast guardian of its cultural heritage, preserving the memories and traditions of past generations for future enjoyment and enlightenment. It serves as a platform for promoting tourism and community engagement, contributing to the revitalization and preservation of Binondo’s cultural heritage.",1,,,"{'None': ['Asia', 'Europe'], 'HKG': ['Hong Kong Special Administrative Region'], 'USA': ['Chinatown'], 'ESP': ['Aldea de San Nicolás, La'], 'PHL': ['Manila', 'Binondo', 'Pasig River']}",professional_cultural_exchange,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Philippines,1936,inquirer.net,2013-02-11T02:36:34Z,"Amid row, a center for PH-China friendship thrives in Angeles City","ANGELES CITY, Philippines—A center that teaches Mandarin and Chinese culture at a university here has been strengthening friendship and understanding among Filipinos and Chinese amid political tension arising from a territorial dispute in the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea).
“It’s for friendship … so we can understand each other,” said Zhang Shifang of the Confucius Institute at Angeles University Foundation (CI-AUF), which the Chinese government established in 2010.
ADVERTISEMENT
Zhang, 41, heads the CI-AUF, the third in the Philippines. The first Confucius Institute was set up at Ateneo de Manila University in 2006 and another opened at Bulacan State University in 2009.
The Confucius Institutes in the Philippines are among 358 centers in 105 countries so far, said Lourdes Nepomuceno, CI-AUF director.
Although the Philippines and China are locked in a territorial dispute in the West Philippine Sea, the two teachers avoided the topic in an interview before the Chinese New Year.
“We leave the political side to experts,” Zhang said. “We are just promoting language and culture. This is cultural diplomacy.”
Recognition
On Jan. 12, Education Secretary Armin Luistro recognized the CI-AUF as the lead institution for the training of local Chinese teachers for a special language program in Mandarin.
Liu Yandong, a Politburo member of the Chinese Communist Party and chairman of the council of the Confucius Institute in Beijing, cited the facility in the 50-year-old AUF as one of the 30 most outstanding CIs in the world in 2011.
“The recognition comes because of the quality of the program. It has influenced mainstream government,” Nepomuceno said, referring to partnerships made chiefly with the Department of Education (DepEd), Department of Foreign Affairs, Bureau of Customs and the National Library.
“Others think the center promotes the philosophy of Confucius or it is religious. It’s not,” she said. She likened the Confucius Institute to the Goethe Institute of Germany, Instituto de Cervantes of Spain, and British Council of the United Kingdom.
ADVERTISEMENT
The CI-AUF’s partner is Fujian Normal University (FNU), said to be one of China’s oldest and most respected universities. It sends volunteer teachers to CI-AUF’s language and arts classes. The center has 50 teachers.
Mandarin classes
Top students in Grades 7 to 12 will start taking Mandarin next year through a 40-hour module as part of a career path.
The CI-AUF, also in partnership with the DepEd, has trained 300 teachers in the last two summers to teach Mandarin. Those who passed the Chinese proficiency test have been teaching in pilot schools in Paoay Lake National High School in Ilocos Norte, Mabolo National High School in Cebu City, and Zamboanga West National High School in Zamboanga City.
At least 60 teachers will be sent to Shanghai this summer for cultural immersion as a requirement for a certificate course.
The CI-AUF has opened a China book room at the National Library to be a “window to China.”
Learning Mandarin can be practical, too, according to Zhang, who shared the experience of a Filipino who landed a job in Macau although his language skill was poor.
The CI-AUF is going to graduate its first batch of eight scholars in Bachelor of Secondary Education major in Chinese language teaching in April.
The CI-AUF has grown because the host university, through its chairman, Joseph Emmanuel Angeles, and its chancellor, former Commission on Higher Education Chairman Emmanuel Angeles, support the program, Zhang said.
Being a nonprofit institution, the CI-AUF can teach Mandarin at a cost of only P3,500 for a 40-hour module.
“Mandarin’s the new English,” Nepomuceno said.

Richard Gordon on Saturday expressed disappointment over the noninclusion of former president Benigno Aquino 3rd and former Budget secretary Florencio Abad in the list of persons indicted for reckless imprudence resulting in homicide over deaths allegedly linked to the anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia.Gordon, chairman of the Senate Blue Ribbon committee, said Aquino and Abad, along with former Health secretary Janet Garin, should be held criminally liable for the mess.Sen. Richard Gordon. FILE PHOTO“Former president Aquino is responsible because he caused the purchase of Dengvaxia and in the process caused irreversible damage, possibly death to children, and anxiety, sleepless nights, unnecessary expense on the part of the parents and guardians,” he said.“The greatest sin and transgression of Aquino was to put the lives of Filipino children in grave peril. He simply did not care. He’s insensitive and lacks compassion,” Gordon added.A blue ribbon committee report submitted earlier by Gordon recommended the indictment of Aquino for violation of Republic Act (RA) 3019 or the “Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act,” as well as RA 6713 or the “Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.”Gordon said Aquino’s two meetings with officials of vaccine manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur violated RA 6713.“President Aquino is guilty of malfeasance, misfeasance, and nonfeasance. From the time he inappropriately met with Sanofi in Beijing on November 9 2014, and once again a year later in December 1, 2015,” the report said.Gordon said that by meeting with mere senior vice presidents of Sanofi Pasteur, Aquino was sending a strong message of perception that he was dispensing undue patronage.Gordon said Abad committed technical malversation for releasing funds for a program that was not in the national budget.“Malacañang should take a second look at it, I hope the DoJ (Department of Justice) secretary is lisitening and he will take a second look at it, because as far as I am concern ‘di nila tiningnan yung aspeto ng procurement at yung reckless talaga dyan nagbigay sila ng gamot na di pa sila sigurado na mag-wo-work (they did not look at the procurement aspect and the most reckless was that they gave the drugs even if they were not sure that it will work),” Gordon emphasized.In a statement on the indictment prepared by the office of Justice Undersecretary Mark Perete, DoJ spokesman, stated that the Justice department has indicted Garin and four others of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide over deaths allegedly caused by controversial anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia.The statement made no mention about Aquino and Abad.Malacañang on Saturday welcomed the indictment of Garin and several others over the alleged deaths of eight children who received the government’s anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia.“The wheels of justice have began to grind for the victims and families of children who died allegedly because of the Dengvaxia vaccine with the Department of Justice finding probable cause to charge former officials responsible for the failed immunization program initiated during their time,” Palace spokesman Salvador Panelo said in a statement.“We hope that true justice and peace will be attained as this is the only way we can deliver proper closure to the victims of the vaccination initiative and their families,” he added.Panelo, however, appealed to the public to stop politicizing the Dengvaxia controversy because it discredited other health programs of the government and brought about undesirable results.“Now that the legal process has taken its course, we wish everyone would finally stop politicizing the issue in the court of public opinion, noting that such exercise has only caused an unnecessary fear on the part of parents for good and creditworthy health programs of the government to the detriment of innocent children,” he said.The Palace official also assured the public that the executive branch would not interfere with the court cases that Garin and her co-accused would face.“As for the defendants, they should welcome this latest development as an opportunity to clear their names and raise whatever defense they have in relation to the matter before a court of law,” Panelo said.“As always, we will not interfere in the proceedings, save for the DoJ, which is mandated by law to prosecute accused felons,” he added.The Justice department on Friday said   there were enough grounds to indict Garin, nine officials from the Department of Health (DoH), two officials of the Food and Drug Administration, two officials of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, and six from Dengvaxia manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur.State prosecutors, however, dismissed the same complaint against incumbent Health chief Francisco Duque 3rd, former DoH officer in charge Herminigildo Valle, two Sanofi Pasteur officials and 15 Zuellig Pharma officers.Garin and the other respondents were found to have “exhibited ‘inexcusable lack of precaution and foresight’ when they facilitated, with undue haste, ‘the registration and purchase of Dengvaxia’ and used the vaccine in implementing a school-based dengue mass immunization program,” according to the statement.“The Panel found sufficient evidence that Garin and the other respondents circumvented various regulations in the purchase of P3.5 billion worth of Dengvaxia vaccine which constituted proof of their reckless imprudence,” it added.Garin earlier said in her counter-affidavit that the available data and information on Dengvaxia at the time the vaccines were purchased all pointed to its safety and efficacy.If convicted, Garin and the other respondents face up to six years in prison for each of the accusations.Responding to the DoJ’s findings, Garin said, “I believe the criminal case is very weak because there is absolutely no evidence linking the vaccine to the deaths. We are confident in the dismissal of this case.”“It is only the Philippines that has politicized the issue,” Garin said in  a statement.The government stopped its nationwide dengue vaccination program and pulled Dengvaxia off the market in late 2017 after Sanofi warned that the vaccine might cause severe symptoms if given to those who did not have prior exposure to the mosquito-borne disease.Sanofi maintained no death was confirmed to have been caused by Dengvaxia.with CATHERINE S.

Philippines,7922,inquirer.net,2016-02-19T12:18:13Z,Australia warns Beijing over threat of conflict in South China Sea,"SYDNEY, Australia—Australia urged China on Friday to refrain from the “militarization of islands” to avoid walking into a conflict, a day after the United States slammed Beijing for deploying missiles in the disputed South China Sea.
China said Thursday it had weapons on one of the islands in the strategically important region, which US Secretary of State John Kerry said was evidence of an “increase of militarization” and a “serious concern.”

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said it was critical for the region’s prosperity that China and the US used international law to resolve their disputes.
READ: South China Sea key on agenda for Australian official’s Beijing visit
“We urge all claimants in the South China Sea to refrain from any building of islands, any militarization of islands, any land reclamation,” Turnbull said in a joint press conference with his New Zealand counterpart John Key in Sydney.
Turnbull said both Australia and New Zealand wanted to see a lowering of tensions as he urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to resolve all disputes in the seas—through which one-third of the world’s oil passes—through legal means.
“President Xi of China has said that one of China’s biggest challenges is falling into what he calls the Thucydides Trap, which essentially is where a rising power creates anxiety among other powers such that conflict occurs,” he said.
“If China wants to avoid falling into the Thucydides Trap, as President Xi describes it, then resolving disputes in the South China Sea should be done through international law, through all of those mechanisms that are available to us.”
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said the two nations’ economic relationships with China, an important trading partner, would allow them to make their case against escalating tensions publicly and privately.
Beijing claims nearly all of the South China Sea. It has insisted that its island building aims to provide services such as search and rescue facilities, but also maintains it has the right to deploy necessary “self-defense” measures there.

BEIJING – President Duterte said that the Philippines fully respects the rule of law amid the ongoing mass protests in Hong Kong against the proposal to detain and extradite offenders to Mainland China.
Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo made the statement following the bilateral meeting between Duterte and Chinese President Xi Jinping here Thursday.
In a press briefing here, Panelo said Duterte expressed that the Philippines fully respected the rule of law, reiterating that Duterte’s motto has always been to follow the law.
“That we respect the rule of law. Yun ang sinabi ni Presidente (That’s what President Duterte said). And the President of China appreciated that statement,” he said.
Demonstrations in Hong Kong have been going on since March, and began with the demand on the Hong Kong government to withdraw the bill seeking to detain and extradite wanted people to Mainland China.
Some fear the bill would place Hong Kong people and visitors under Mainland Chinese jurisdiction, undermining the autonomy of the region and citizens’ rights.
Protests started peacefully but saw a sharp escalation in violence on June 12 when the bill was scheduled for a second reading in the Legislative Council. Riot police reportedly deployed tear gas and rubber bullets against demonstrators.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, whose resignation was already demanded by the rallysists, suspended deliberations on the bill on June 15, and declared the bill “dead” on July 9. However, she did not say that the bill would be withdrawn.
Lam also issued a limited public apology, saying she failed to properly communicate the bill’s purpose and for not holding public consultations.
The demonstrations then sought the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police behavior. According to reports, at least 2,100 have been reported injured, 748 arrested as of August 16.",1,,,"{'HKG': ['Hong Kong Special Administrative Region', 'Hong Kong'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",diplomatic_statement,['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping'],"['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese']"

Philippines,4282,manilastandard.net,2014-05-05T00:00:00Z,China warns US against military alliances in Asia,"SHANGHAI—Chinese President Xi Jinping issued a veiled warning to the United States on Wednesday, saying countries should not build up military alliances in Asia, even as Beijing feuds with neighbors in territorial disputes. Speaking at a little-known Asian regional forum on security, Xi said a rising China would seek “peaceful” means to resolve territorial disputes. Beijing has sought to counter Washington’s foreign policy “pivot” to Asia, but it has also irritated Vietnam, Japan and the Philippines -- the latter two allies of the US -- with what those countries say are aggressive moves in separate territorial disputes. “To beef up an entrenched or military alliance targeted at a third party is not conducive to maintaining common security,” Xi said, without naming names. Washington’s traditional allies in the Asia-Pacific region include Japan, where it has military bases and whose security it guarantees by treaty, and Australia. China’s official Xinhua news agency on Tuesday urged countries from outside Asia not to foment tensions. “Players from other parts of the world need to play a constructive role. They should refrain from starting fires and stoking flames,” it said in an editorial. Relations between China and Vietnam have worsened after Beijing sent a deep-water oil drilling rig into contested waters in the South China Sea earlier this month, sparking violent Vietnamese protests in which at least two Chinese were killed. China and Japan have a long-running feud over disputed islands in the East China Sea, while the Philippines accuses China of reclaiming land on a disputed reef within its exclusive economic zone under a United Nations convention. But Xi said: “China stays committed to seeking peaceful settlement of disputes with other countries over territorial sovereignty, and maritime rights and interests.” He was speaking at the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), a relatively obscure forum which exists alongside other more prominent regional groupings. Vietnam belongs to the forum, but Japan is only an observer while the Philippines is not a member. The United States has observer status, preferring to work through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.Xi, who became president last year, has overseen a foreign policy which has sought to assert China’s interests in both continental Asia and the Pacific Ocean. He told the forum that China was interested in a regional security code, but gave no details. Earlier this month, Southeast Asian leaders expressed “serious concern” over worsening territorial disputes in the South China Sea, calling for a peaceful resolution and presenting a rare united front against Beijing. Several countries have overlapping claims in the South China Sea, which is home to key shipping lanes and thought to contain vast energy reserves. Before the start of the forum, Xi shook hands with other state leaders attending, including Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Hassan Rouhani of Iran and Afghanistan’s Hamid Karzai. But the live television broadcast appeared to cut away when Vietnamese Vice President Nguyen Thi Doan shook hands with Xi. The move by China’s heavily-censored state television drew some laughter from Chinese journalists in the media centre, with one saying: “You can’t see that.” On Tuesday, Xi and Putin launched naval exercises off Shanghai and held talks but failed to seal a long-awaited deal for Russia to export natural gas to an energy-hungry China. Analysts said China is trying to raise the importance of the conference, which in some respects competes with APEC and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. “Everyone is a bit surprised it’s being made such a big deal,” said Raffaello Pantucci, research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies. “It’s more about China trying to build their regional relationships... in a part of the world where they’ve made a very active push,” he said.",1,,,"{'None': ['Asia', 'Pacific Ocean'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Shanghai', 'Beijing', 'International Asia-Pacific Convention Center'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Washington'], 'VNM': ['Socialist Republic of Vietnam', 'South China Sea'], 'JPN': ['Japan'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'AUS': ['Commonwealth of Australia'], 'RUS': ['Russian Federation'], 'IRN': ['Islamic Republic of Iran'], 'AFG': ['Islamic Republic of Afghanistan'], 'TWN': ['East China Sea']}",diplomatic_statement,"['China', 'Xi Jinping', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Xi Jinping', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

Philippines,18452,inquirer.net,2018-11-19T16:06:04Z,"De Lima hits Duterte’s 'incoherence' in South China Sea, West PH Sea policy","Opposition Senator Leila De Lima on Monday slammed President Rodrigo Duterte’s “incoherence” in government policy on the South China Sea (SCS) and West Philippine Sea (WPS).
De Lima said the President’s declaration that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is upholding freedom of navigation and overflight in the SCS and his pronouncement that China is “already in possession” of the disputed waters reflects the government’s incoherence in foreign policy on the SCS and the WPS dispute.

“One day Duterte is asking China what routes it would allow Philippine vessels to take in the disputed waters, the next day he is asserting freedom of navigation with Japan, China’s bitter rival over another disputed area, the East China Sea,” De Lima said in a dispatch from Camp Crame where she is currently detained.
“One day the Philippine President is acting as China’s mouthpiece, defending China’s possession of the SCS, the next day he makes a completely contradictory statement in support of freedom of navigation,” she added.

READ: Duterte: China ‘already in possession’ of S. China Sea; wants no military drill there
De Lima said this “mixed messaging” does not build confidence in the government’s capacity to “clearly articulate” the country’s interests, adding that the country’s foreign policy on the South China Sea depended on which side of the bed the President gets up after every nap.”
“Most of the time he wakes up favoring China. Once in a while, he wakes up demanding that China should respect freedom of navigation,” De Lima said.
De Lima said that President Duterte may have squandered the Philippines’ “most solid legal ground” against China in the SCS dispute, which is the decision of the The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) rejecting China’s nine-dash line claim and upholding the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone in the WPS.
She added that the President has wasted international legal recognition of the Philippines’ claims over China’s outrageous incursions, in exchange for China’s support to his regime.
“This is Duterte’s most inexcusable act on the WPS dispute, more inexcusable than sleeping on the job,” De Lima said.
“It is already a serious concern that the President napped through several important Association of South East Asian Nationa (Asean) Summit meetings. But it seems that what he does when he is awake should worry us more. And this includes giving away to China the Philippines’ rights over the WPS, despite the ruling of the Arbitral Tribunal,” she added. /ee

Philippines,11146,manilastandard.net,2016-12-06T00:00:00Z,‘PH can’t stop China’,"Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr.
FOREIGN Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. admitted Friday that the Philippines cannot do anything about China’s move to militarize a series of contested artificial islands in the South China Sea. “There is nothing that we can do about that now, whether or not it is being done for purposes of further militarizing these facilities that they have put up,” Yasay told journalists in Singapore. “We cannot, we cannot stop China at this point... and saying do not put that up. We will continue to pursue peaceful means [by] which all of these can be prevented,” he added.Yasay said the Philippines would tolerate Beijings actions so that there will be “no further actions that will heighten the tensions between the two countries,” particularly in the Scarborough Shoal. “We will leave it at that. For the Philippines, we have our bilateral engagements with China... and our efforts have paid off. As you can see, our fishermen are allowed to... not allowed—But our fishermen now have free access, insofar as Scarborough Shoal is concerned,” Yasay said. On Thursday, the US-based think tank Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative showed new satellite imagery showing that China has installed “significant” defensive weapons in its seven islets in the Spratly Islands in recent years, built up from much smaller land protuberances and reefs. Although Beijing has said it does not intend to militarize the contested waters of the South China Sea, ongoing satellite imagery has shown the installation of military equipment and longer runways. They appear to be large anti-aircraft guns and close-in weapons systems, the AMTI said. Despite these threats however, Yasay said that the issue about the militarization and the construction of permanent facilities by China “has already been passed upon by the arbitral tribunal and decision there is very clear.”“We will move forward in the future insofar as pursuing the enforcement of the decision of the arbitral tribunal,” he added. He said the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea was a major concern for the United States, Japan and the European Union. “Let them take whatever action is necessary in the pursuit of their national interest... and we will leave it at that. For the Philippines, we have our bilateral engagements with China,” Yasay said. He said the country would continue to engage China in other aspects of their relationship—trade, investments, people-to-people contact, cooperation, infrastructure development and other such assistance “that will have no strings attached.” A leftist Duterte ally in the House, however, assailed China for its militarist actions. “This is highly deplorable as it further militarizes an already militarized maritime zone. It raises the stakes for a potential regional dispute as US President-elect Donald Trump claimed he is ready to confront Beijing on territorial issues,” Bayan Muna party-list Rep. Carlos Zarate said. What is worse though, Zarate said, is that the action was done despite President Xi Jinping’s pledge not to militarize the islands in the Spratly archipelago. “There should be a stop to these militarist activities both from China and the US because it would be very disadvantageous to the region and its people if this situation escalates,” Zarate said.",1,,,"{'None': ['Asia', 'Spratly Islands'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'South China Basin'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'SGP': ['Republic of Singapore'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'JPN': ['Japan']}",diplomatic_statement,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Beijing']"

Malacañang is neither surprised nor bothered by the results of a survey showing the majority of Filipinos trusted the United States more than China and Russia.
Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo acknowledged that even as the Duterte administration has adopted an independent foreign policy, Filipinos have been “pro-American” for more than a century.
“As we previously said regarding similar survey results conducted in the past, we are not surprised — neither are we bothered — by the outcome, considering that it has only been three years since the Duterte Administration has chartered an independent foreign policy course for the Philippines,” Panelo said.
He said an information dissemination would be needed to foster understanding of the government’s “friends to all and enemies to none” policy.
“While we are not forcing any preference to the mentality of our people, we understand that it entails a lot of information dissemination for Filipinos, who have been pro-American for more than a hundred years, to appreciate the current government’s foreign diplomacy approach, that is ‘friends to all, and enemies to none’ which has reaped economic benefits to the country,” he said.
A survey conducted by Pulse Asia showed that China is the least trusted country by Filipinos amid a maritime dispute.
At least 74 percent of the respondents do not trust China while only 26 percent trust Beijing. The survey also found only 57 percent of Filipinos do not trust Russia while 42 percent trust Moscow.
The United States, on the other hand, is the most trusted country by Filipinos, followed by Japan, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, United Kingdom, Indonesia, and Vietnam.
A Pulse Asia poll also showed Filipinos want the government to ask China to sanction its nationals that hit a Filipino vessel and abandoned the local fishermen off Recto Bank last month.
Panelo said the government shares public opinion that China should sanction the crew members of the involved vessel which carried its flag.

Philippines,1072,inquirer.net,2012-07-18T03:08:10Z,"Chinese newspaper slams PH, Vietnam for running to US for help","MANILA, Philippines—One of China’s top newspapers has assailed the Philippines and Vietnam for their alleged “attempt to grab islands and waters (in the South China Sea), which don’t belong to them by riding the back of the tiger,” apparently referring to the United States.
The Beijing-based Global Times, in a July 16 report, also said Manila and Hanoi “hope to get massive military assistance from the US, which the US can’t afford to provide.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The report, titled “Clinton’s trip highlights weak points of US return to Asia,” was written by Liu Zongyi, a research fellow of the Center for South Asia Studies at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies.
It noted that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton “made a trip encircling China recently.”
“From Japan to Mongolia then to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, Clinton mainly focused on three things: backing Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines in disputes with China over maritime territorial sovereignty, balancing China’s economic influence in Asian by enhancing trade and economic ties with Southeast Asian countries, and promoting support for democracy and human rights as the core of US Asian strategy while attacking China’s development model,” it said.
According to Liu, Clinton’s “every topic targeted China by insinuation. It seems the US is tightening its encirclement of China. But on the other hand, we can see the weakness of the US’ ‘back to Asia’ strategy.”
“The Obama administration’s strategy covers political and military fields, as well as trade and economy. But the strategy seemingly is gradually losing its edge,” said Liu.
From the military perspective, Liu pointed out “the US has enhanced its deployment in the Asia-Pacific region and interfered in territorial disputes between China and relevant countries. The South China Sea disputes and the Diaoyu Islands dispute have been intensified as the US wedges in. But the US aims at checking China by taking advantages of these disputes rather than directly confronting China. Getting involved in an armed conflict with China is the least desirable option.”
“Clinton’s Asian tour mainly focused on promoting trade and economic relations, catering to some Asian countries’ pleasure. The US hopes to block the economic integration of East Asia and compete with China for economic influence. But if the US could really shift its competition focus with China from the political and military fields to the economic field, this would benefit the regional stability and prosperity in East Asia,” the report said.
China “advocates establishing a new type of relationship between China and the US in which the overall pattern cannot be influenced by specific problems.”
“Avoiding conflicts is the first step. The Sino-US relationship should develop based on mutual respect, mutual promotion and peaceful competition,” Liu added.

Last weekend, the Global Times ran a report quoting Liu Weimin, a spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry, as having said Beijing opposed Manila’s plan to offer oil exploration contracts in the South China Sea (called by Philippines as the West Philippine Sea).
Liu said China “has repeatedly lodged representations with the Philippines for their bidding out oil exploration contracts in some of the blocks, which have violated China’s interests.”
“Without permission from the Chinese government, oil exploration activities by any country or any company in waters under China’s jurisdiction are illegal,” she also said.
Liu also called on the Philippines to make its due contribution to maintaining peace and stability in the disputed waters.

“He called on ASEAN leaders not to choose — or be forced to choose — sides by pointing out what he calls a ‘strategic mistake’ committed by the past leaderships of the Philippines, which he his now rectifying through his independent foreign policy,” he added.
The President also earlier urged Asean leaders to “exercise self-restraint” amid the still-ongoing dispute over the South China Sea.
He also vowed the Philippines’ commitment to fast track the crafting of the code of conduct (COC) over the disputed waters.

Philippines,8823,manilatimes.net,2016-06-02T00:19:03Z,Rody says China’s Xi a great president,"Incoming President Rodrigo “Rody” Duterte on Tuesday described China’s Xi Jinping as “a great President,” in another hint that frosty relations between the Asian neighbors could soon warm.
Duterte heaped the praise on Xi in a news conference in response to questions about a message the Chinese President sent to congratulate him on winning this month’s Philippine elections
But the long-time mayor of the southern city of Davao, who has been criticized for lacking foreign policy experience, appeared unsure of Xi’s title.
“I was honored, receiving a congratulatory message from a great President, uh Prime Minister,” Duterte said.
The Chinese foreign ministry said on Monday that Xi wrote to Duterte after his victory, a standard diplomatic tradition for heads of state.
China’s official news agency Xinhua reported that Xi hoped the two sides would “get bilateral relations back on the track of sound development.”
Chinese-Philippine ties soured during the six-year term of outgoing President Benigno Aquino 3rd, whose government sued China before a United Nations tribunal over its claims to most of the South China Sea.
A ruling is expected in the coming weeks, with the Philippines’ response to it likely to be left to Duterte, who takes office on June 30.
Unlike Aquino, Duterte has said he is willing to engage China in bilateral talks on the issue.
Yet he has also played to nationalist sentiment by saying he would ride a jet ski to plant a Philippine flag on disputed islands in the South China Sea.
Duterte also on Tuesday said he would not be fully reliant on the United States, the Philippines’ former colonial ruler and most important military ally.
“We will be chartering a course of our own. It will not be dependent on America, and it will be a line not intended to please anybody but the Filipino interest,” he added.

China and Vietnam have long traded barbs over the strategic and resource-rich South China Sea, which Beijing claims most of.

Tensions have flared in recent months, with Vietnam suspending an oil exploration project operated by Spain’s Repsol in an area off its coast claimed by Beijing.
In June, a meeting between top Vietnamese and Chinese generals over border issues was abruptly cancelled, with both sides citing a sudden scheduling conflict.
Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia also have competing claims in the sea.
READ: Vietnam challenges China in Asean talks
Hanoi condemned Beijing’s latest military drills in the Paracel Islands, a contentious archipelago claimed by both sides.
“Vietnam strongly rejects China’s move and seriously requests China to respect Vietnam’s sovereignty over the Hoang Sa archipelago,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said late Tuesday, using the Vietnamese name for the Paracels.
China said last week it was conducting “regular military training in the relevant maritime area located in the northwest of the South China Sea,” where the Paracels are located, claiming jurisdiction over the zone.
The two countries fought a brief but bloody skirmish over the Paracels in 1974. More than 70 Vietnamese soldiers were killed and China has had de facto control over the islands since then.
Last week, Vietnam repeated calls for Beijing to halt its activity in the area, and foreign affairs officials in Hanoi met with Chinese embassy staff “to clarify Vietnam’s position.”

Some $5 trillion in annual shipping trade passes through the South China Sea, which is believed to be rich in oil and gas deposits.
Tensions between Vietnam and China over the sea came to a head in 2014 when Beijing moved an oil rig into waters claims by Hanoi.
The move sparked weeks of deadly anti-China protests across Vietnam. JPV

Philippines,31787,manilastandard.net,2021-04-20T00:10:00Z,Unrequited love,"""President Duterte should stand up to Xi Jinping instead of keeping silent.""


 

Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque now says that President Duterte has not been silent in the wake of the incursion of more than 200 Chinese coast guard and fishing vessels on an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off eastern Palawan known as the “Julian Felipe Reef” at the West Philippine Sea.

After a series of diplomatic protests filed against China for this incursion, the Chinese ambassador lied through his teeth, claiming that those vessels suspected to be militia were for shelter. He contradicted himself, later claiming that the Julian Felipe Reef was part of Nansha Island which is part of the Chinese territory. But, when a group of ABS-CBN journalists took the initiative of going to the Reef for a look-see, they were chased by a Chinese Coast Guard vessel. This was clearly a form of harassment. And yet President Duterte kept on with his deafening silence, my gulay!

Through all this, Duterte hasn’t uttered a single word, raising the question of Duterte’s unrequited love for Chinese President Xi Jinping. Sure, Jinping promised us loans and investments, but now Duterte’s pivot to China is under scrutiny.

Is the pivot all worth all the bullying we are experiencing from China?

Roque now has the temerity to tell us that Duterte has not been silent over the issue on Chinese incursion into our territory. Roque says Duterte is employing “private diplomacy,” talking to Xi and his Chinese friends privately. 

Now, what malarkey is this? 

Duterte should make it clear to the FIlipinos what’s going on. This issue is a threat to our national security and sovereignty. My gulay, should he and his spokesman just keep to themselves what’s going on in a matter of grave concern?

Yes, I admit that when it comes to foreign policy, only the President can issue a policy with the Department of Foreign Affairs as his spokesman. But what is happening at Julian Felipe Reef is no longer just a matter between Xi and Duterte. Will we soon become part of Chinese territory? This prospect to me is frightening because there seems to be nothing we can do about it.

What we need as a nation is for the President to raise his voice against what his Chinese friends are doing against us. In other words, we want a President to echo the sentiment of the nation against his Chinese friends.

Santa Banana, amid the depressing news of the surging new cases of COVID-19 every day, and with the higher number of daily fatalities and the fact that hospitals and health workers are now overwhelmed with sick people dying in make-shift tents, waiting for ERs and ICUs to accommodate them, now we hear that richer nations have cornered 87 percent of all the vaccines available, according to the World Health Organization.

The WHO reported that rich countries have received more than 87 percent of vaccines available and the low-income countries, including the Philippines, got just 0.2 percent of available vaccines.

That should well explain the slow and delayed vaccine rollout. This is why we cannot hope to achieve“herd immunity” anytime soon.

So far only the vaccines available are from Sinovac and AstraZeneca from Great Britain. The government is still expecting procurements from Pfizer in the coming months. 

The worst part of it all is that 50 percent of Filipinos continue to doubt the safety and efficacy of vaccines of whatever brand. This contributes to more deaths. And Santa Banana, we have a President who continues to doom vaccine doubters instead of making them have faith and confidence on vaccines!

As I have said from the start, the reason there is so much doubt on the safety and efficacy of vaccines is that there has been no effort on the part of the President and his vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. to conduct a massive education and information program on the benefits of getting vaccinated. 

As the country grapples with the long-delayed arrival of vaccines, there is a growing desperation of people to resort to whatever means as a cure to COVID-19. Filipinos are trying ivermectin, and virgin coconut oil.

President Benigno Aquino 3rd (left) looks on as Japan’s Emperor Akihito delivers his speech during a state dinner hosted by the emperor at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.[/caption]
TOKYO: Japan’s Emperor Akihito has told Philippine President Benigno Aquino 3rd his country feels “remorse” for its actions during World War II, in what one commentator said was a prod to nationalist Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Akihito’s role is narrowly defined and he is expected to stay above the fray, so any remarks he makes that stray into the political -- however obliquely -- are parsed for possible meaning.
In a speech welcoming Aquino to a palace banquet late Wednesday, Akihito noted there were active ties between Tokyo and Manila by the beginning of the 20th century.
“During World War II, however, fierce battles between Japan and the United States took place on Philippine soil, resulting in the loss of many Filipino lives.
“This is something we Japanese must long remember with a profound sense of remorse,” he said, according to the official English translation provided by the Imperial Household Agency.
“In particular, in this year of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, I offer my deepest condolences to all those who lost their lives then,” the emperor said.
His remark comes as Abe prepares a statement he is expected to deliver in August, which is being closely watched for any sign of what critics say is backsliding on previous Japanese apologies.
Abe’s predecessors offered apologies for colonial rule and aggression on the 50th and 60th anniversaries, but he has hinted he is unlikely to repeat that, saying instead he wants to issue a “forward-looking” statement.
That sentiment has caused disquiet among Japanese liberals and anger in Beijing and Seoul, which insist Tokyo needs to say sorry for its war history.
Akira Hashimoto, a veteran journalist on royal matters and a former schoolmate of the emperor, said Aquino’s visit had given the nominal head of state “an opportunity to express his opinion” that Japan should squarely admit its past wrongdoing.
The emperor “is striving to have the message heard,” Hashimoto noted.
“I believe his Majesty wanted Prime Minister Abe, rather than the Japanese people or people in other countries, to hear,” he told Agence France-Presse.
The mass-selling Yomiuri Shimbun also noted that Wednesday’s palace banquet was the third for Philippine guests since Akihito ascended to the throne, but was the first at which he had touched on the human cost of the conflict there.
The emperor “has always recognized Japan took wrongful actions during [World War II] and has felt deep remorse over the tragedies it brought about... His view has never wavered,” the pundit said.
Time to invest
The President also on Thursday encouraged Japanese investors to do business in the Philippines, citing the country’s improved business climate and the strength of the Filipino workforce.
In a speech before the Philippine Investment Forum in Japan, he described the country’s current status as a “far cry” from the country’s standing when his predecessor, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, left office.
“While the Philippines of today is a far cry from the Philippines of five years ago, there remains much to be done. There are other paths we can pave toward even greater progress, which is precisely why we are here,” Aquino told Japanese investors.
“Japanese companies have already made their mark on the Philippine electronics, shipbuilding, and automotive industries, among others, to the point where their work and their products are already irreplaceable in the lives of Filipinos. Today, I tell you, there is no better time to set up shop in the country,” he said.
According to Aquino, reforms initiated by his administration have resulted in a favorable business climate in the Philippines.
“We have leveled the playing field, improved the quality of infrastructure and vastly minimized corruption in doing business,” he said.
The President cited the country’s selling points, including its average 6.3 percent average GDP growth, credit ratings upgrade and the quality of the Filipino workforce.
“No doubt, this is due both to increased global demand and to the quality of our workforce. Filipinos are young, trainable, and skilled, companies have entrusted them with producing quality products, from luxury bags, to electronics and automobiles, to the components of modern aircraft,” Aquino said.
He also noted the Philippines’ acceptance into the European Union’s Generalized System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) that allows exporters to the EU to enjoy duty-free access for certain products.
“The Philippines as an investment destination is more attractive today than at any other point in our history. We can further deepen, or forge partnerships in which all parties benefit,” Aquino said.
The President is on the third day of his four-day state visit to Japan.
Also in his speech, Aquino cited how the Philippines adopted the Japanese philosophy of kaizen, or an aspiration of “continuous improvement” or “change for the better.”
“Though my administration may not necessarily have been familiar with the term at first, we have been practicing our own version of kaizen these past four years and eleven months. Among our goals was for our country to become a strong and competitive player in the global economy,” he said.
The President acknowledged Japan’s “role in securing the economic success,” being consistenly among Philippines’ leading trading partners.
Japan was the Philippines’ top trading partner in 2014 with total trade reaching $19.1 billion last year. It was also the top source of IPA- or Investment Promotion Agency-approved investments with total investments worth $0.8 billion in 2014.
“Allow me to once again express our deep appreciation to Japan for staying the course, for even with the economic difficulties prevalent in many parts of the globe, you have consistently been among the top sources of approved investments into the Philippines,” Aquino said.",0,,,"{'JPN': ['Japan', 'Tokyo'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila'], 'CHN': ['Beijing'], 'KOR': ['Seoul']}",diplomatic_statement,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing']
Philippines,34275,mb.com.ph,2021-10-10T15:39:00Z,Taiwan leader says island will not bow to China,"TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan will not bow to pressure by Beijing and will defend its democratic way of life, President Tsai Ing-wen said Sunday, following a spike in incursions by Chinese warplanes into its air defence zone.
AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN
Self-governed Taiwan’s 23 million people live under the constant threat of invasion by China, which views the island as its territory and has vowed to one day seize it, by force if necessary.“The more we achieve, the greater the pressure we face from China,” Tsai said in a speech marking Taiwan’s National Day, adding: “Nobody can force Taiwan to take the path China has laid out for us.”She described Taiwan as “standing on democracy’s first line of defence”.“We hope for an easing of… relations (with Beijing) and will not act rashly, but there should be absolutely no illusions that the Taiwanese people will bow to pressure,” she added.The two sides have been ruled separately since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.Tensions have risen to their highest in decades under Chinese President Xi Jinping, who broke off official communication with Taipei following Tsai’s election five years ago and ramped up economic, diplomatic and military pressure.There has been another flare-up with a significant uptick in flights by Chinese fighter jets and nuclear-capable bombers into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ).Beijing sent some 150 sorties into the zone in the days surrounding China’s own National Day on 1 October — a record number.
Xi has made taking Taiwan a key goal of his leadership.
On Saturday, he declared in a speech that “the complete reunification of our country will be and can be realised”.
He said he favoured “peaceful reunification” but Xi’s words come after months of increased military threats, including the recent surge in air incursions.
Last year, there were a record 380 sorties. There have already been more than 600 this year.
The ADIZ is not the same as Taiwan’s territorial airspace. It includes a far greater area that overlaps with part of China’s own air defence identification zone and even includes some of the mainland.
Tsai, who has won two elections, is loathed by Beijing because she regards Taiwan as an “already independent” country, not part of “one China”.
But she has also made no move to declare formal independence, something Beijing has long warned would be a “red line” that would trigger an invasion.
She has also made offers for talks with Beijing that have been rejected.
During Sunday’s speech, Tsai reiterated her call for Beijing “to engage in dialogue on the basis of parity” and said she supported maintaining the current status quo between the two neighbours.
But she warned what happens to Taiwan would have major regional and global implications.
“Every step we take will influence our world’s future direction, and our world’s future direction will likewise affect the future of Taiwan itself,” she said.",1,,,"{'TWN': ['Taiwan', 'Taipei'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'PHL': ['Manila']}",diplomatic_statement,"['China', 'Xi Jinping', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Xi Jinping', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,4051,manilastandard.net,2014-04-02T00:01:00Z,"China raps  PH, says it  damaged  relations","CHINESE officials went on the offensive on Tuesday, as they accused the Philippines of ‘damaging bilateral relations’ while expressing strong opposition to the government’s filing of its memorial before an international tribunal hearing the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea) territorial dispute case.

In Manila, Chinese embassy Charge de Affairs Sun Xiangyang said that the Philippine’s move to submit its case before the Arbitral Tribunal had “damaged bilateral relations” with China.

Sun said that the Chinese government was “deeply disturbed by and concerned with the consequences” of the Philippines’ move challenging China’s nine-dash line claim in virtually the entire West Philippine Sea.

“What the Philippine side did seriously damaged bilateral relations with China,” Sun said.

Sun also claimed that the Philippines had failed to “notify the Chinese side” when it brought its dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal on January 2013, which prompted Beijning not to accept the arbitration.

 
 “After the Philippine side initiated the arbitration, the Chinese side promptly made its position clear that China does not accept the arbitration,” he said.

Sun’s claim, however, was not accurate, since the government did send a copy to former Chinese ambassador to Manila Ma Keqing when it filed its notice for arbitration.

The Chinese official also argued that the Philippines was wrong in citing the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea as basis for its filing, since “the “framework of the Convention is not applicable to all maritime issues”.

He added that international justice or arbitration is one way of settling international disputes, but it does not “offer a solution to all problems”.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'South China Basin'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila']}",diplomatic_statement,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese', 'CHINESE']"

He lauded the Chinese community for their contribution to the Philippine economy through trade and investments.
“They have contributed to the economy by trade and investments. Their cuisine has been dearly familiar in many Filipino homes. Their philosophy and attitude in life are a wellspring of practical lesson that all of us, regardless of nationality, can learn from,” he said.
“To everyone who believes in the miracle of beginnings and who makes a choice for hope against fear, my best wishes on this auspicious season of the Chinese New Year,” he added.
The Chinese New Year will be celebrated in the country on January 28. IDL

Philippines,12576,inquirer.net,2017-05-14T01:04:11Z,Duterte to meet Putin during China forum,"BEIJING — President Duterte may have an opportunity to have an impromptu meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the two-day Belt and Road Forum (BRF) here, the Philippine envoy said on Saturday.
Philippine Ambassador to China Jose Santiago Sta. Romana told reporters that Putin would be joining the forum which would be held here from today until Monday.
ADVERTISEMENT
China has invited 29 state leaders to participate in the BRF for International Cooperation, a “historically significant” event that marks the shift in global powers from the West to Asia, Sta. Romana said.
“This is the first international forum where you’ll see President Duterte with Xi Jinping and Putin. He’s talked about wanting to be with them, so here’s an opportunity. You have the emergence that this summit presents—a new world order,” Sta. Romana said.
President Duterte has shifted the Philippines’ geopolitical strategy closer to home, by pushing closer ties to China and Russia while pulling away from the United States, its traditional defense ally.
Recent visits by Chinese and Russian naval vessels to the Philippines have punctuated the policy shift.
While President Duterte was scheduled to have a bilateral meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and President Xi Jinping, Sta. Romana said there was still no schedule yet for a one-on-one talk with his Russian counterpart.
Sta. Romana, however, said there was a possibility for a brief pull-aside between Putin and President Duterte.
“They will be together in the same room but it would be a big room. I’m sure there would be time for interaction,” he said.
Mr. Duterte, as well as the 28 other state leaders, will give a short speech on Monday during which he is scheduled to talk about the “Philippine experience” to include the country’s infrastructure development, Sta. Romana added.
This is the second time that President Duterte would be in China in an official trip.
ADVERTISEMENT
In October, he made a state visit in China to rekindle relations soured by the dispute over the South China Sea, a strategically vital waterway through which a third of the world’s maritime traffic passes.
The forum was meant to usher in a “new world order” led by China, Sta. Romana said, sending a positive signal that the Philippines may have made the right bet in rekindling ties with the regional behemoth.
“It’s actually going to be a landmark event. It marks the transition and the emergence of a new world order in which there will be multiple power centers. We are emerging and transitioning from a unipolar world that is dominated by the US and the West into one in which Asia, particularly China, is emerging as a center of gravity particularly in the field of economics and trade,” he said.
The Belt and Road Initiative, which takes inspiration from the ancient trade route, would link parts of Asia, Europe and Africa./rga

A Department of Finance statement has stated that the conduct of feasibility studies for two big-ticket infrastructure projects in Visayas and Mindanao will be funded by Chinese concessional loans and grants.

“Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III and China Commerce Vice Minister Fu Ziying, who is also China’s international trade representative, formalized the agreement on the conduct of preliminary feasibility studies for the proposed Davao City Expressway and the Panay-Guimaras-Negros Island Bridges Project through an exchange of letters after last Friday’s meeting between Philippine and Chinese officials,” the DOF said.
“The exchange of letters will enable the dispatch of Chinese experts to conduct preliminary studies on the two projects. The grant assistance is aligned to the Memorandum of Understanding on supporting the conduct of feasibility studies of major projects signed between the DOF and China’s Ministry of Commerce in October 2016,” it explained.
The country’s chief economist, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto M. Pernia, also signed with Fu the six-year development program between the Philippines and China, aimed at promoting and steering “stable and orderly development of economic cooperation between the two countries,” according to the DOF.
The program is also aimed at “enlarging the scope and enhancing the level of cooperation between, and driving sustainable and inclusive socioeconomic development in the two countries.”
The DOF said Wang also met with the economic team on the sidelines of his visit to Davao City, President Duterte’s hometown.
“In the high-level meeting with Chinese officials led by Wang, Dominguez thanked China for its grant of assistance worth $91 million, which include a $1-million donation for the earthquake-hit Surigao; a $75-million grant for the construction of the Binondo-Intramuros and the Estrella-Pantaleon bridges across the Pasig river; and the ongoing $15-million financing provided under the anti-illegal drugs and law enforcement security cooperation agreement signed last year between the two countries during President Duterte’s October state visit to China,” the DOF disclosed.
The DOF said the meeting between the Cabinet and Wang focused on the following: bilateral cooperation in agriculture, fisheries, infrastructure, investments, trade and tourism; Chinese funding for Philippine infrastructure projects; as well as the Asean- and China-led free trade agreement Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the Philippines’ chairmanship of this year’s Asean Summit.
The DOF quoted Wang as saying that his visit to Davao was China’s “preparation for future high-level visits and to ensure that past visits will result in successful outcomes.”
According to Wang, “increasing investments from China could encourage the establishment here of more industrial parks,” the DOF said.

Also, “the Chinese side expressed its commitment to provide assistance to the Philippines in solving Metro Manila’s traffic woes by supporting the construction of bridges crossing the Pasig River and improving living conditions for informal settlers by providing housing support,” the DOF added.
The DOF also said that China has been eyeing Davao and Palawan “as sites for its investments and cooperation with the Philippines in the fields of agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries.”
“The Chinese side will encourage well-known agricultural companies in China to invest in and cooperate with the Philippines and possibly explore setting-up of demonstration areas to showcase advance practices in agriculture, including investments in aquaculture,” according to the DOF.
“China also expressed enthusiasm on the growth potentials of the country’s tourism industry and has targeted one million tourist arrivals from mainland China to the Philippines to help realize the goals of the Asean-China Year of Tourism, which was launched in Manila last March 16,” it added.
As such, Wang was quoted by the DOF as saying that China “will lose no time to enhance cooperation and give concrete help to the President and contribute to the development of the Philippines.”
The DOF said Wang also “expressed the willingness of the Chinese government to provide financing through various channels on top of China EXIM Bank’s concessional and preferential buyer’s credit facilities, such as through the China Development Bank and Bank of China,” as well as support co-financing of Philippine projects through China-led multilateral lender Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
The Philippine government already officially proposed to the AIIB co-financing of the $500-million project aimed at preventing flooding in the National Capital Region, as documents showed that $150 million
had been sought for the Metro Manila Flood Management Project.
For his part, Dominguez said Wang’s visit and the preceding discussions between Philippine and Chinese officials following the President’s visit to Beijing in October last year “reflect our steadfast commitment to enhance cooperation between our two countries.” SFM

The Philippines and China have been in a long-standing maritime dispute as Beijing claims almost the entirety of the South China Sea, which overlaps with the West Philippine Sea.
The Philippines scored a victory against China in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, Netherlands in 2016. The arbitration court declared Beijing's claim over nearly the entire South China Sea as illegal.
China has refused to acknowledge the ruling and continues to claim nearly the entire South China Sea.
Apart from the Philippines and China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei have also competing territorial claims in the South China Sea.
During the 25th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) Summit in Phnom Penh, Cambodia on Novemver 11, Marcos called for the early conclusion of a final and binding Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea to ensure peace and stability in the region.
In his intervention, Marcos said the immediate conclusion of the COC becomes more relevant as nations mark 40 and 20 years of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC), respectively.
""It shall be an example of how states manage their differences: through reason and through right. I, therefore, welcome the progress on textual negotiations on the COC this past year and hopefully an approved code of conduct in the very near future,"" he said.
Xi was represented by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang during the Asean-China Summit.
In his opening remarks, the Chinese premier stressed that both China and Asean countries uphold peace and stability in the South China Sea.
""This year celebrates the 25th anniversary of the DOC. We mark this special occasion because the DOC has played an important and indispensable role in promoting peace in the South China Sea. And this represents the very principle that we shall keep to a making and realizing long term peace in the South China Sea. We are also conducting COC consultations,"" Keqiang said.
""In this process, we take into account interests of all parties.

Philippines,7456,manilatimes.net,2015-11-05T10:39:36Z,China's Xi heads to Vietnam as anger brews over visit,"HANOI: Chinese President Xi Jinping heads to Hanoi on Thursday for a visit that has drawn the ire of Vietnamese nationalists at a time of bubbling conflict over disputed territory in the South China Sea.
The communist neighbours have long celebrated their political and economic ties but in recent years tensions have flared in a decades-old feud over island chains in the contested waters.
Ahead of Xi's visit -- the first by a Chinese president to Vietnam in 10 years -- anti-China activists have staged small but rare protests in the heart of the Vietnamese capital and southern Ho Chi Minh City.
""Protesting Xi Jinping's visit"", said one of the banners held aloft by some dozen demonstrators Tuesday as they marched through downtown Hanoi, flanked but not arrested by at least triple the number of police.
Rallies are rare in authoritarian Vietnam, but the ruling regime has increasingly tolerated low levels of dissent against its main ally China.
Relations between the two nations plummeted to their lowest point in decades in May 2014 when Beijing moved an oil rig into the contested South China Sea waters.
The anti-China riots which ensued targeted foreign-invested factories and saw the Asian giant evacuate thousands of its nationals as at least three Chinese were killed.
Xi's visit is being viewed by some Vietnamese observers as an attempt to improve relations after that episode.
He ""aims to calm down Vietnam and other countries over the recent construction by China"" in the South China Sea, said Duong Danh Dy, a former Vietnamese diplomat in Beijing.
Xi, who is due to land in Hanoi at around 0500 GMT, will meet ruling Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong, President Truong Tan Sang and Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung during his two-day trip.
Territorial dispute
Last week Chinese officials told reporters in Beijing that the territorial dispute would be discussed as well as cooperation on trade, education and infrastructure.
China lays claim to almost all of the South China Sea, parts of which are also claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan as well as Vietnam.
Japan and China are also locked in a row over disputed islands in the East China Sea.
In recent months Vietnam has been trying to strengthen bonds with other nations to counter China's growing regional prowess.
Communist Party general secretary Trong was received by US President Barack Obama in July, the first party chief to visit the country and the White House.
Vietnam is also party to the recently sealed Trans-Pacific Partnership, the world's largest free trade deal between 12 nations including the US and Japan but not Beijing. The TPP is viewed by some as a counterbalance to growing Chinese economic clout.
Japanese Defence Minister Gen Nakatani will also be in Vietnam during Xi's trip. He is due to tour a strategic naval base on Thursday in central Vietnam, according to Vietnamese state media.
Despite their political closeness, Vietnam and China fought a brief but bloody war in 1979 triggered by Hanoi's invasion of Cambodia.

Philippines,36042,manilatimes.net,2022-08-03T00:20:00Z,"Myanmar, Ukraine loom over Asean meetings","PHNOM PENH: Southeast Asian foreign ministers are gathering in Phnom Penh for meetings addressing persisting violence in Myanmar and other issues, joined by top diplomats from the United States, China, Russia and other world powers amid tensions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and concerns over Beijing's growing ambitions in the region.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) meetings in Cambodia's capital will see US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov together at the same venue for the second time in a month, though it's not clear whether the two would meet.
The two did not meet separately when they both attended the Group of 20 foreign ministers' meeting in Bali, Indonesia in early July. But they had their first direct contact since before Russia invaded Ukraine in a phone call last Friday, when Blinken urged Moscow to accept a deal to release American detainees Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan and discussed other issues.
Also attending is Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Many have urged Beijing to use its friendship with Russia to push for an end to the conflict in Ukraine and to help promote peace and a return to civilian rule in Myanmar after last year's coup there sparked mass protests and armed resistance.
The meetings come at a time of tension between Washington and Beijing as the US pushes back against China's growing economic and military influence in the Asia-Pacific.

US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is touring the region and may visit Taiwan. That has heightened friction further, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian warning last week that ""those who play with fire will perish by it.""
China sees Taiwan as its own territory and has said it might reclaim the East Asian island by force if necessary. The US follows a ""one China"" policy in which it recognizes Beijing as the government of China yet maintains informal relations and defense ties with Taiwan.
In a call last week with US President Joe Biden, Chinese leader Xi Jinping objected to the possibility of a Pelosi stop, which would be the highest-level US visit to the island in more than 25 years.
High concern
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, its impact on global food and energy prices and escalating China-US friction is of high concern for the 10-member Asean, according to Susannah Patton, director of the Southeast Asia Program for Australia's Lowy Institute.
""This is one of the first regional meetings of foreign ministers to have been held in person since 2019, so for the United States, China and even Russia, meetings like this are a really important opportunity to demonstrate their support for the Asean and present their own narratives about their commitment to regional security and prosperity,"" she said.
Blinken, Wang and Lavrov have all been jockeying for influence recently on multiple foreign trips. After the meetings, Blinken will head to the Philippines and later to Africa.
Biden hosted Asean leaders at the White House in May at the group's first-ever summit in Washington. During those meetings, Biden announced he was nominating one of his top national security aides as ambassador to the group, underscoring the Asia-Pacific's importance to the US.
Most recently, Lavrov has focused on Africa, while Wang visited multiple Pacific islands in May and made a five-nation swing through Southeast Asia last month.
During that trip, he said China was speeding up talks with the Asean, which includes four countries that are in dispute with Beijing over territorial claims in the South China Sea, to come up with a nonaggression pact called a ""code of conduct"" to turn the body of water ""into a sea of peace and cooperation.""
Myanmar, where the military ousted the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, 2021, is an Asean member. It is not sending any delegate to the meetings after other members decided that no political representative from the country could attend.
Escalating violence in the country is prominent on the Asean agenda as it struggles to implement a five-point consensus it reached in Myanmar last year. It calls for dialogue among all concerned parties, providing humanitarian assistance, an immediate end to violence and a visit by a special Asean envoy to meet with all parties.
Widespread protests
Suu Kyi's ouster triggered widespread peaceful protests that were violently suppressed. They have evolved into armed resistance and the country has slipped into what some United Nations experts characterize as a civil war.
Blinken has criticized the Asean for not doing enough on Myanmar. The resumption of judicial executions in late July, when the military-led government hanged four political prisoners, has driven a stronger backlash against its military rulers, by Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah condemning the act as a ""crime against humanity.""
New sanctions are being considered and Abdullah said ahead of the meetings that the group should consider scrapping or revising its five-point consensus. He said the Asean's special envoy also needed to meet with the National Unity Government, a shadow civilian administration established outside Myanmar, to help develop a new political framework.
""The end game is a democratic, inclusive and just, peaceful and harmonious, prosperous Myanmar, whose civil and political rights are guaranteed by the constitution,"" he said.
Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi has proposed that the Asean hold a special meeting on Myanmar specifically to discuss recent developments.
More than 2,100 people have been killed by the Myanmar junta since it took power and nearly 15,000 have been arrested, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nongovernmental organization that tracks killings and arrests.
""All developments in Myanmar, including the death penalty for political prisoners, show a setback rather than progress from the implementation of the five-point consensus,"" Marsudi said.",1,,,"{'None': ['Asia', 'Africa', 'Southeast Asia'], 'MMR': ['Union of Burma'], 'UKR': ['Ukraine'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Washington', 'White House'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'International Asia-Pacific Convention Center', 'South China Basin'], 'RUS': ['Russian Federation', 'Moscow'], 'KHM': ['Kingdom of Cambodia'], 'IDN': ['Republic of Indonesia', 'Provinsi Bali', 'South Pacific Islands'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan'], 'AUS': ['Commonwealth of Australia'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines']}",diplomatic_visit,"['Sergey Lavrov', 'Moscow', 'Beijing']","['Wang Yi', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Wang Yi']","['Wang Yi', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,14074,inquirer.net,2017-11-07T19:20:25Z,Vietnamese city gears up to host leaders at Apec summit,"Famed for its tranquil beaches and verdant national parks, Vietnam’s coastal city of Danang will be in the global spotlight this week as it hosts the largest gathering of world leaders in its history.
The likes of United States President Donald Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will all be in Vietnam’s third-largest city for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
ADVERTISEMENT
Most of them will arrive on or before Friday, ahead of the official welcome ceremony and gala dinner to be hosted by Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang. The leaders then convene at a plush resort hotel for retreat sessions and lunch on Saturday, where they will discuss ways to boost innovative growth and the new drivers of regional trade and investment, among other issues.
Established in 1989, the 21-member Apec bloc comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the US and Vietnam. Together, they represent about 39 per cent of the world’s population, 57 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and 49 per cent of international trade.
This year’s summit is significant as it is the first for Trump, South Korean President Moon Jae In, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. It is also the first overseas summit for Xi after last month’s Chinese Communist Party congress, and for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, after his recent sweeping election victory.
Dr Alan Bollard, executive director of the Singapore-based Apec Secretariat, said the summit is taking place at a “very complex” time, largely due to the many views on trade policy around the world.
Vietnam has largely kept the focus of discussions on four broad policy areas – promoting sustainable and inclusive growth; deepening regional and economic integration; modernizing micro, small and medium-sized enterprises; and enhancing food security, he noted.
“These priorities aren’t exactly new, and they are similar to those of the previous Apec chairs, including Peru last year,” said Dr Bollard, a former governor of New Zealand’s Reserve Bank. “They remain important to this day, and we do need to have this sort of continuity from year to year to keep the talks going, as many of these issues are long term in nature.”
As with all multilateral summits, there will be other pressing issues not on the official Apec agenda, but that will capture leaders’ attention.
All eyes will be on the outcome of a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) meeting on Friday, as the 11 remaining nations in the mega free trade agreement inch closer to finalizing a deal. The US pulled out in January after Trump took office. Even without the world’s largest economy, Singapore and the other nations want to seal a deal aiming to eliminate tariffs on industrial and farm products.
The latest round of negotiations took place in Japan last week. The 11 countries have a combined GDP of US$12.4 trillion (S$16.9 trillion), with total trade reaching US$356.3 billion last year.

This year’s Apec summit comes at a time when the region is fraught with tensions over a nuclear-armed North Korea. Trump is scheduled to meet Putin on the sidelines, with a primary topic likely how to stem threats posed by Pyongyang.
There are also question marks over whether tensions in the South China Sea could be raised, although officials from China and Vietnam have said they remain committed to managing the ongoing territorial dispute through friendly talks.
Dr Bollard said the media would “inevitably focus” on these issues, but there would not be any formal talks on them during the meetings.
“We’re all very disciplined. We are going to be there for economic advancement, and that’s the glue that’s held us together for all these years,” he said. “Having done a lot of good work for the past 20-plus years, we do want to prove that we are still relevant for the next two decades. There will be change. We might, say, spend more time talking about e-commerce or focus more on the inclusive economy, and so on.”
Papua New Guinea will take the Apec chair for the first time next year. The 2019 and 2020 hosts are Chile and Malaysia respectively.

Communications Undersecretary Kris Ablan made this statement after President Duterte said on Thursday, March 31, that Xi had expressed his intention to talk to him. They are scheduled to have the meeting on April 8.
In a press briefing, Ablan said that the meeting would not be face-to-face.
“Ang alam po natin ay online po ang meeting na ito sa darating po na April 8 (What we know is it will be held online on April 8),” he said Friday, April 1.

In a speech in Lapu-Lapu City on Thursday, President Duterte said he is scheduled to talk to President Xi on April 8. While he was not specific about their discussion, he expressed concern about the Ukraine-Russia conflict spilling over to the Philippines.
“Mag-usap kami ni Xi Jinping kasi, siguro, yung sabi ko na… Para masabi ko lang na (President Xi and I will talk because… perhaps… so I can say that) the Philippines might really be included in the vortex of giyera dito,” he said.
“‘Pag tinamaan ang Russia ng nuclear o ang Russia ang unang magtira (If Russia is hit with a nuclear weapon or if it strikes first), then there will be serious trouble, and China will not just sit idly there,” he added.
According to the President, the Philippines will undoubtedly be affected by a “full-scale war” because of the presence of American forces in the country. He has decided to allow the United States of America (USA) to use the Philippines’ bases in fear of a spillover of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.
Despite this, Duterte reiterated that he would not allow the country’s soldiers to participate in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.

Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay, who met US Secretary of State John Kerry, said Mr. Duterte was poised to hold bilateral discussions with Putin and Xi on Saturday, barring unforeseen impediments.
The United States did not request a private meeting between outgoing US President Barack Obama and Mr. Duterte, and neither did the Philippine side, the country’s top diplomat told reporters on the sidelines of Apec ministerial meetings.
A request, however, emanated from China, he said.
“We are still going to confirm that. Most likely it will be a pull-aside, likewise with Russia,” Yasay said, adding that Peru, the host country, and a few others had also sought bilaterals with Mr. Duterte.
“But I would imagine because of time constraints — just travel from Manila to Lima is exhausting for the President — it might not be possible to accommodate all the requests,” he said.
As for the prospect of meeting Putin at Mr. Duterte’s own request, Yasay said he was hopeful it would push through, though he admitted nothing was set in stone yet.
Apec is an economic, trade and investment forum among 21 Pacific Rim countries, including the Philippines, the United States, China, and Russia. It’s a year-long series of ministerial discussions that culminate in the Economic Leaders Meeting.
The member economies of Apec account for approximately 40 percent of the world’s population, an estimated 55 percent of world GDP, and about 44 percent of global trade.
Established in 1989, with the Philippines as a founding member, Apec has worked to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers across Asia Pacific in a bid to create efficient domestic economies and dramatically raise exports.

In his speech at the Davao International Airport before departing for Brunei, Duterte said his foreign state visit would focus on intensifying two-way trade and investments and developing our halal sector and micro, small and medium enterprises, and asking support for the government’s antinarcotics campaign.

“In the area of defense and security cooperation, I will seek collaborative undertakings in the sharing and expertise on maritime security as well as capacity building. I will seek closer collaboration and mutual support in our campaign against illegal drugs and importance towards attaining our common goal of realizing an ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) drug-free community,” he added.

“I will look forward to renewing the ties of friendship between the Philippines and China and to reaffirm the commitment to work closer to achieve shared goals for our countries and peoples.

Philippines,19004,mb.com.ph,2018-11-20T11:35:54Z,China's President Xi arrives in PH for historic visit,"By Marjaleen Ramos and Roy Mabasa
Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in the country at 11:28 a.m. today for a historic two-day state visit.
The Chinese leader was accorded arrival honors at the tarmac of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1. This is the first visit of a Chinese President in more than a decade.
His first day in Manila includes visits to the Rizal Monument in Luneta Park for a wreath-laying ceremony and to Malacañang Palace where Xi will have a comprehensive discussion with President Rodrigo Duterte on several major goals in order to elevate the relationship between Manila and Beijing to a higher level during his two-day state visit to the Philippines.
“It gives me great pleasure to pay a state visit to the beautiful Republic of the Philippines at the kind invitation of President Rodrigo Duterte upon arrival in Manila,” Xi said in a statement on Tuesday.
“As friendly neighbor across the sea, China and the Philippines enjoy geographical proximity and a strong bond that links our peoples and culture for centuries our two countries have stood together through thick and thin and written splendid chapters of of friendly exchanges.”
Xi said he is looking forward to meet President Duterte for an in-depth exchange of view on how to further strengthen China-Philippine relations and on regional and international issues of mutual interest.
The Chinese leader also mentioned his meeting with Senate President Vicente Sotto III and House Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. “I am convince that this visit will cement the traditional, friendship deepen the mutually beneficial cooperation and enhance the effort of the two sides for common development.”
“I am visiting this time mainly to have in-depth discussions with President Duterte on how to elevate our all-round cooperation under new circumstances and make overall plan for greater progress in our relationship toward a higher level. There are a number of things we need to do if we are to achieve this goal,” Xi said in a statement released by the Chinese Embassy in Manila on Monday.
Aside from a bilateral meeting with Duterte, the Chinese leader is also expected to witness the signing of several pacts, including a possible agreement on the Philippines-China joint exploration in the West Philippine Sea.
According to Xi, among the goals that the two countries should touch on during the discussion is the need to deepen political mutual trust between the two sides, including the highly-contentious South China Sea issue.
“We need to properly handle differences through friendly consultations, enhance dialogue and cooperation on maritime issues, and make the South China Sea a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation that truly benefits our two peoples,” he said.
The Chinese President noted though that under Duterte, China and the Philippines have re-engaged in dialogue and consultation for the “proper handling” of the South China Sea issue.
During their talks, Xi will also seek to enhance practical cooperation with the Philippines on China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, and in the areas of defense, drug control, counter-terrorism and law enforcement to foster a sound environment and peace and stability in the region.
On people-to-people ties, Xi sees the need to strengthen the exchanges, promote interactions between the political parties, parliament, think-tanks and at the local level to keep the relations as strong as ever.
“China and the Philippines are very close to each other in terms of geographical location, ancestral ties and cultural background. Friendly exchanges between our two peoples are an endless source of strength for our relations. As the saying goes, the flames rise high when everybody joins to add fuel,” he said.
As China seeks to join hands to deepen East Asia cooperation under the ASEAN-China strategic partnership platform, Xi expressed his firm support to the Philippines’ roles as country coordinator and vowed to work with Manila to secure greater cooperation in East Asia.
On Mindanao, the Chinese President said China will increase its input in the BIMP-EAGA initiative launched by the Philippines and assist with the development of the Southern Philippines and in other regions of the country, as well.
“As a Philippine proverb goes, “Seize today, or you will lose tomorrow.” China will work with the Philippines to seize the opportunity and go along with the trend of our time. Let us work together to build upon the Asian tradition of peace, credibility and good neighborliness, and further consolidate the bilateral relations for an even brighter future of the two countries and of Asia as a whole,” Xi said.",1,,,"{'None': ['Asia'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'South China Basin'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Far East Asia Village', 'Mindanaw', 'Luneta Park']}",diplomatic_visit,"['China', 'Xi Jinping', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Xi Jinping', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

This came after Xi’s awkward walk while he was keeping distance from Aquino and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet on Wednesday as they headed for the Apec leaders’ dialogue with the Apec Business Advisory Council (ABAC) at the Philippine International Convention Center (PICC).

Xi was noticeably keeping distance from Aquino and Bachelet, both of whom were heartily talking, even though the three of them were walking in a row toward the dialogue room.

Aquino and Bachelet shared a history of hardship under a dictatorship. Bachelet and her family were tortured under the Pinochet military dictatorship, while her father was killed under police custody. Aquino’s father, the opposition senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr., was assassinated during the Marcos dictatorship.
For Thursday’s retreat, Aquino shook hands and talked with Xi upon his arrival at the PICC. Aquino also walked with him for the family photo, where they stood beside each other smiling.
Walking toward the family photo platform, Xi was no longer a loner as he chatted with Malaysian President Najib Razak.
As they settled at the table, Aquino sat between Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang. Xi sat beside Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying.
United States President Barack Obama also arrived for the Apec retreat. He was noticeably absent in yesterday’s ABAC dialogue.
The Apec Summit was held in Manila amid the maritime case before the United Nations-backed International Arbitration Tribunal filed by the Philippines against China over the dispute on the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea).

China is claiming almost all the seas even though Philippines claim it is within its exclusive economic zone under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The UNCLOS is the primary international agreement which governs maritime disputes on overlapping maritime zones.
China has refused to participate in the case even though Philippines scored initial victory when the Tribunal ruled that it has jurisdiction over the maritime dispute.
China had also built artificial islands over the disputed waters large enough to carry ships and planes, compelling the Philippines and ally US to station patrol ships near the land reclamation works. CDG

Philippines,20424,mb.com.ph,2019-04-24T00:43:39Z,Presidential visits,"OF TREES AND FOREST
By MANNY VILLAR
President Rodrigo Duterte is set to embark on his fourth trip to China this week. During his state visit here last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping extended the invitation to PRRD to attend the Second Belt and Road Forum (BRF). This visit follows three previous presidential trips to China—a state visit in October, 2016, participation in the First Belt and Road Forum in May 2017, and the Boao Forum in April, 2018.
Presidential visits are important foreign policy instruments because they strengthen our relations with other countries. Perhaps equally important, presidential visits boost economic cooperation (be it bilateral, regional, or global) and by extension spur our nation’s business and trade. I am fortunate to have the opportunity to join the Philippine delegation together with government officials and other representatives from the business sector.
In the past, our presidents have utilized state and official visits to pursue our national interest on the global stage. Former President Fidel V. Ramos, for instance, used his trips deftly in promoting trade and tourism for the Philippines.
Since his election in 2016, President Duterte has embarked on a number of presidential visits primarily to shape his foreign relations strategy focused on a recalibration of our relations with the United States and a broadening of our ties with other countries such as Russia, Japan, China and our ASEAN neighbors.
Duterte’s first international trip to Laos to attend the 28th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit was characteristic of this shift in foreign policy. On the sidelines, Duterte met with his counterparts from Japan, Singapore, New Zealand, Vietnam, host Laos, and, most significantly, Russia.
The planned meeting with then US President Barack Obama was scrapped by the White House although the two leaders would meet informally at a later event. But considering the long-standing “special relations” between the Philippines and the US, the fact that the Duterte-Obama meeting was not the centerpiece of this presidential trip was a strong indication of the new direction the Duterte administration has decided to embark on.
Duterte’s October, 2016, official visit to Tokyo was significant as it focused on economic and defense issues. In particular, the visit was beneficial to our Armed Forces in terms of capacity-building trainings and, more importantly, additional patrol boats, trainer aircraft and high-speed craft so crucial for our maritime security. This was on top of investment offers and loans totaling $19 billion for infrastructure, agricultural development, defense, and employment.
Duterte’s May, 2017, historic visit to Russia saw the signing of agreements on defense cooperation, intelligence sharing, agriculture, trade, tourism, culture, foreign affairs, transportation, and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. This visit was interrupted by the siege of Marawi City warranting the abrupt return of the commander-in-chief after declaring martial law in the whole of Mindanao.
The President’s three previous visits to China (and President Xi’s reciprocal visit) were of course equally historic because they represented a reorientation of the bilateral relations between the two countries previously strained by territorial disputes and geopolitical issues.
I am particularly excited about this 4th China visit because the 2nd Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation will, for the first time, be attended by members of the Asia-Pacific business community. This was emphasized by the Chinese president when he announced the holding of this second forum. This of course differed from the inaugural meeting where most attendees came from governments and think tanks.
I am hopeful that the meeting will produce a more concrete roadmap to implement the ideals of the 1st BRF Joint Communiqué on “the importance of expanding economic growth, trade and investment based on level-playing field,” and more significantly, “consultation on an equal footing…including respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries; formulating cooperation plans and advancing cooperation projects through consultation.”",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', ""Bo'ao"", 'International Asia-Pacific Convention Center'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'RUS': ['Russian Federation'], 'JPN': ['Japan', 'Tokyo'], 'LAO': ['Lao People’s Democratic Republic'], 'SGP': ['Republic of Singapore'], 'NZL': ['New Zealand'], 'VNM': ['Socialist Republic of Vietnam'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Marawi City']}",diplomatic_visit,['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping'],['Xi Jinping'],"['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese']"

It’s the biggest trade show in the mobile calendar and it’s where many of the year’s most exciting handsets are often announced – alongside tablets, wearables, and other tech.MWCS 2021 starts this February 23 up to 25. Huawei will kick off with Huawei Day Forum with the first topic 5G Brings New Value to be followed by relevant presentations and discussions in line with this year’s theme, CONNECTED IMPACT.Prior to the main event, Huawei shared to media 5G: Lighting Up the Future with Ryan Ding, board and the president of Carrier Business Group, at the Huawei Pre-MWCS 2021 Media and Analyst Briefing.“2020 has been a difficult year. During this time, Huawei worked closely with our customers,” Ding began. In 2020, Huawei supported the stable operations of over 300 networks across more than 170 countries and helped operators provide online services and minimize the impact of the pandemic on their business. Working with Huawei, operators attracted 22 million new wireless home broadband users worldwide. Thanks to this, people can easily access telemedicine services and work from home. More than 140 commercial 5G networks have been deployed in 59 countries. According to Ding, over 50% of these were built by Huawei. The ecosystem is also maturing. In China, more than 68% of smartphones shipped in 2020 were 5G phones. More than 200 5G modules and industrial devices are now available, supporting 5G application in a broad range of industries.According to the 2020 reports from third parties, including IHS, P3, OpenSignal and Meqyas, the best 5G networks in Seoul, Amsterdam, Madrid, Zurich, Hong Kong, and Riyadh were all the networks built by Huawei. Ding stressed that great network experience is the foundation of business success, and that these 6 cities are just a tip of the iceberg in terms of our collaborative innovation with operators. For instance, by deploying Huawei’s 64T64R AAUs and leading multi-antenna algorithms, LG U+ achieved higher spectrum efficiency and network experience more than 25% better than other operators. With Huawei’s Blade AAU, which can operate in both Sub3G and C-Band, Sunrise shortened site acquisition time from 24 months to 6 months and was only operator with 5 straight outstanding ratings in Switzerland.5G is becoming part of core production processes in industries. Looking ahead, Mr. Ding was bullish about the prospect of large-scale deployment of 5G industrial applications in 2021. 5G applications have been deployed in more than 20 industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, education, and logistics. Ding pointed to examples in China where 5G industrial applications are already proving their worth, such as in coal mining, steel making and manufacturing, where the adoption of 5G has, Ding said, made production safer, more intelligent, and more efficient. Ding emphasized that, ”5G is no longer for early adopters, it is improving our daily lives. 2021 will be the first year with large-scale 5G industry applications. Operators will need new capabilities in network planning, deployment, maintenance, optimization, and operations, to achieve “0 to 1”, and replicate success from 1 to many. Huawei will have exhibitions and in-depth discussions on these topics with industry stakeholders online and offline at the upcoming MWC Shanghai. We will keep innovating to help our customers build the best 5G networks and achieve greater business success.”",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Shanghai'], 'CHE': ['Switzerland', 'Zürich'], 'PHL': ['Manila'], 'KOR': ['Seoul'], 'NLD': ['Amsterdam'], 'ESP': ['Madrid'], 'HKG': ['Hong Kong'], 'SAU': ['Riyadh']}",tech_transfer_investment,"['Huawei', 'Shanghai']","['Huawei', 'Shanghai']","['Huawei', 'Shanghai']","['Shanghai', 'Huawei']"
Philippines,21160,mb.com.ph,2019-06-21T00:00:00Z,Globe Telecom launches first PH 5G service backed by Huawei equipment,"By Emmie V. Abadilla
The Philippines became the first Southeast Asian country to experience commercial fifth-generation (5G) fixed wireless broadband after Globe Telecom the other night launched its At Home Air Fiber 5G postpaid plans. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. is providing the equipment.
The Globe At Home Air Fiber 5G enables the telco to connect more Filipinos at home given the external challenges of rolling out fiber optic cables in the country, announced President and CEO Ernest Cu.
“The arrival of 5G has caused excitement in the global world of telecommunications. Today, we bring first-world Internet to the Philippines,” he added.
The Globe At Home Air Fiber 5G postpaid plans offer fiber-like speeds up to 100Mbps and super-sized data packages of up to 2 terabytes will be initially available in select areas in Pasig, Cavite, and Bulacan.
The service also reinforces the company’s goal to connect two million homes by 2020.
“Prior to Air Fiber 5G, we have aggressively used fixed wireless solutions to connect more homes and businesses to the Internet over airwaves.”
“This strategy resulted in home broadband subscriber base increasing by 55.1% to 1.7 million in the first three months of 2019 from 1.1 million in the same period in 2016,” Cu revealed.
Globe at Home Air Fiber 5G will be available to eligible customers next month, July, 2019.
Plans come at P1899 per month for up to 20Mbps, P2499 for up to 50Mbps and P2899 for up to 100Mbps. All come with up to 2TB data capacity.
“Globe At Home Air Fiber 5G makes use of fixed location wireless radios instead of fiber optic cables which enables us to go over the circuitous approval process of deploying a fiber optic cable – a task which proves to be arduous and involves securing multiple permits from local government units (LGUs),” Cu explained.
“The right of process can sometimes take years to obtain, causing drastic delays in fiber optic roll-out completion,” he added.
So far, Globe has been spending over 21% of its annual total revenues to upgrade and expand its telecommunication and IT infrastructure since 2012.
“We have been ramping up our capital spend from P20.3 billion in 2012 to P43.3 billion in 2018, in order to provide our customers better broadband services,” he noted.
5G technology enables the use of Internet of Things (IoT) for today’s intelligent homes.
Internet connection that is faster, more secure and with lower latency brought by 5G significantly enhances entertainment and security systems at home.
It also promises a better digital experience for Filipino households.",1,,,"{'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Cavite', 'Pasig City']}",tech_transfer_investment,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei']
Philippines,33934,mb.com.ph,2021-08-24T14:05:00Z,Growth hack and fast track your mobile app towards a better digital future,"Building a mobile application and putting it in app stores is not enough. There are many challenges an app owner must face to thrive in the current market scenario. An app must effectively engage with customers, and it must be scalable and robust.
With new apps entering the market daily but tight budgets on their hands – how can start-ups or budding apps compete with the market top players via traditional approaches?
To fast track your app development, it is essential to initiate growth hacking so you can take your business to the next level. Growth hacking is simply the process of implementing technical creativity, analytical thinking, and marketing skill to optimize each possible step in the app journey to pivot and get ahead of the competition quickly.
Growth hacking’s success also rely on applying creative tactics in any part of the product development process and consumer journey; often the choice way for start-ups to succeed in larger audiences within a shorter timeframe at a lower cost. It’s a collaborative effort where marketers, engineers, developers, and product owners contribute together to play a part in the user engagement and growth.
Considering this, Huawei is offering start-to-end support for its app partners from technical resources to marketing channels to assist them in achieving growth quickly and effectively. The on-going AppsUP 2021 – Huawei HMS App Innovation Contest is the tech company’s latest initiative to drive growth hacking. The contest aims to inspire developers to create innovative apps utilizing HMS Core open capabilities, has also provided a stepping stone for app owners to enter the global market to reach Huawei devices users in more than 170 regions and countries.
Growth hacking tips from industry experts
To shed more light on mobile app growth hacking solutions, AppsUP 2021’s judges are being invited to uncover new ways that could assist app developers/owners to improve their app visibilities and drive downloads.
“Growth hacking is an iterative and continuous process. Learnings, observations, and outcomes are feedback into flywheel and will provide insights into product development. I believe it starts with being customer centric – having a clear vision of your intended user and you are serving their needs,” said Ryan Chan, Head, Global Business Development, Global Growth Acceleration, Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC).
Being customer centric, entrepreneurs need to have a plan in place to use analytics from day one to help understand user behavior, personas, and events and to use this analytics data to figure out what works best on your app.
“As with any product, no matter how brilliant an app is, if not marketed well, it’s akin to launching your app into a void. Nobody will ever know about it if it’s not visible and targeted. Coming from a games background, my suggestions aren’t new per se, but could be helpful for traditional/new app developers.” said Gwen Guo, Chairperson, Singapore Games Association (SGGA), who also mentioned that the first thing to do is to explore data-driven decisions, study the target audience’s purchases and engagement habits, and craft the app’s marketing plan based on that information.
There is also a need to explore how social media and its trends can help with an app’s marketing plan for the target audience. Another factor to consider is community management that can help in building a nurturing community that not just helps drum up hype for the app but also follows up with responsive support for customers, helping with customer retention and eventually ratings.
Establishing relationships with launch platforms such as HUAWEI AppGallery and understanding what features these platforms have to boost visibility whether it’s a featured page, new apps list or seasonal collections are equally important as well.
“Since its global launch in 2018 April, AppGallery now has over 550 million active users around the globe. Although AppGallery is growing rapidly within just three years, it is still a comparatively new player in the market. Becoming an early entrant in this less saturated market, means easier discovery for any app products listed in the platform, which help app owners to gain quick visibility and downloads.” said Shane Shan, Director of APAC Huawei Consumer Cloud Service.
As for the current market trend, consumers have high expectations and are extremely demanding. To attract, engage, and retain a user, app developers must move beyond functionality and combine various disciplines to do so. Consumers demand and expect a frictionless end-to-end customer experience, delightful UI and UX, anchored by strong security and privacy controls.
“I think creativity and entrepreneurship are important to growth hacking. It also means being close to your customer. So, continuous communication with your customers is a must. Don’t guess but use actual data to determine your next move. Continuously pivot and iterate depending on your customer feedback. I’d like to see solutions with creative approaches in solving real problems. As well, large addressable market sizes. Finally, how (app developers) will tackle user acquisition and engagement,” shares Jojo Flores, Co-Founder, Plug and Play Tech Center.
Eligibility and Application
AppsUP 2021 welcomes all mobile app developers and app owners, whether students, professionals, startups, or businesses to participate. To be eligible for the contest, developers residing in the APAC region must have their apps integrated with at least one HMS Core kit and published on AppGallery.

A man burst on to a stage and poured water over the head of Baidu CEO Robin Li as the founder of China’s dominant search engine spoke at a company-sponsored event on Artificial Intelligence on Wednesday.
Highly visible public acts of defiance are relatively rare in China’s big cities where security measures can be tight and celebrities like Li generally travel with a pack of security.
Baidu has faced enormous criticism in China in recent years after a medical advertising scandal and discontent with changes to its search result listings that favor its own content.
Li was telling the crowd about Baidu’s autonomous car development as he opened the two-day tech conference, when the man sauntered up on stage and dumped a bottle of water on his head.
It appeared to catch Li off guard and he stood stunned and unmoving for a second as the water poured down.
“What’s your problem?” Li said in English to the individual as he walked off stage.
The incident, which lasted only a few seconds, initially seemed to be part of the presentation until event security intervened to cart off the man.
“Everyone can see that the path of advancing AI will still encounter all types of things we don’t expect,” said Li, with a wet face and drenched white shirt, while calmly resuming his presentation to applause.
Security for the event started light with few personnel visible in the conference room prior to the incident, but security guards soon filled in to stand at the end of each row of the audience.
Baidu issued a statement the incident that echoed Li’s on-stage reaction, but it did not give any details about the individual or what happened to him afterwards.
Baidu has had a rough year posting its first quarterly loss since going public in 2005 during the first quarter, with the head of its core search business also resigning.",0,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Baidu'], 'PHL': ['Manila']}",tech_transfer_investment,['Baidu'],['Baidu'],[],['China']

Philippines,8288,inquirer.net,2016-04-25T00:10:24Z,"Quintel exits China, chooses to expand PH contract","US-BASED Quintel, a leading antenna solutions provider, is pulling out of mainland China to refocus on the Philippines’ Cirtek Advanced Technology and Solutions Inc. (CATS) as its dominant manufacturing supplier.
This was seen to double Quintel’s contract with CATS to around $60 million by next year from this year’s level in turn creating more domestic jobs, top officials of CATS’ parent firm Cirtek Holdings Philippines Corp. said in an interview.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The CEO (chief executive officer) of Quintel went here … It was relayed to us that they were doubling their order of contract by next year because they are shutting down their operations in China and moving it to Cirtek by August,” Cirtek president Roberto Juanchito Dispo said in an interview last week.
Quintel decided to move out of China due to concerns on intellectual property and quality, Dispo said. He said this would benefit the Philippines, which is Quintel’s only other supplier in Asia.
“Next year, Quintel’s total order would be around 40,000 antennas. Quintel assured us that of the 40,000, they would order 70 percent or more from us. That’s the one translating to around $60 million (business),” Dispo said.
Cirtek completed the construction of a third building on its Laguna facility in December last year. The new facility provides additional production capacity to meet increased orders from existing key customers and to support new contracts.
“They are putting all their eggs [in our basket]. That’s high trust of confidence in our capacity and technology. This is a very good contract. It would bring a lot of profitability to the company,” Dispo said.
Antonio Buyawe, Cirtek chief finance officer, said the firm would use the new building for the antenna business for Quintel. A dedicated team of 250 people had been hired just for this, he said.
“That building, more or less, would address our requirements for Quintel and at the same time for additional volumes for our semiconductor business. But perhaps after this year, we may need to expand again,” Buyawe said.
“We need another 170 [people to work on the Quintel business] in two months,” Dispo said.
Cirtek’s advanced technology business through CATS is also seen to grow bigger next year, more than the usual output of its traditional semiconductor business.
ADVERTISEMENT
Quintel designs, develops and delivers advanced antenna solutions that help mobile operators increase efficiency, enhance quality of service, slash costs and accelerate returns.
Overall, Cirtek expected growth from existing businesses this year to grow by 35 percent. Net profit growth was also seen tracking the 8 to 10 percent top line growth, Buyawe said.
Last year, Cirtek grew its core profit by 35 percent to $5.1 million, driven by the growth in revenues from the semiconductor and broadband businesses. Consolidated revenue last year amounted to $59.6 million, an increase of 15 percent from the previous year.

The executive also shared that listed companies in the Philippines, including PLDT, have been focusing on the environment, social work and governance in whatever initiatives that they are undertaking.
Despite the changes, Pangilinan, PLDT and the entire Metro Pacific Investments Corporation Group are committed to fulfilling the conglomerate’s mantra, centering on customer experience. The executive said all data expansion efforts are done to ensure a quality customer experience.

Philippines,33897,mb.com.ph,2021-08-03T11:43:41Z,Accelerating digital economy key for inclusive integration in APAC,"Participants in the webinar titled “Accelerate Digital Economy for Inclusive Integration in Asia Pacific – Connecting Digital Industries in Pandemic” called for leveraging digital opportunities to build an inclusive ecosystem and promoting regional integration, which is particularly important while still combating the pandemic.
A digital economy is increasingly perceived as the way to overcome disruptions caused by COVID-19. Representatives and thought leaders from governmental, industrial and academic sectors across Asia Pacific joined a virtual conversation organized by Huawei to explore the multiple facets of digital economy, from a market, technology, inclusiveness and sustainability perspective.
Based on digital knowledge and infrastructure, the digital economy has powered a growing proportion of regional GDP and boosted resilience amid the pandemic. ASEAN predicts the digital economy will contribute 1 trillion US dollars to regional GDP by year.
Countries from the region have released future-oriented roadmaps on removing trade barriers, improving digital coverage and ensuring ubiquitous access to digital services to facilitate the implementation of the digital economy.
Being part of the ecosystem, Huawei is committed to enabling ASEAN’s Digital Masterplan 2025 in three key areas, namely ICT connectivity, talent empowerment and ecosystem incubation, according to Jay Chen, Vice President at Huawei Asia Pacific. The digital economy unfolding in the region addresses inclusive access to digital service, a landscape facilitating startup scale-up, and a circular, sustainable economy.
Dr. Alvin P. Ang from Ateneo de Manila University agreed with the openly accessible approach on upskilling the public with digital knowledge. “The education system must put in context the foundational elements of digitalization. Whether it’s in the basic education level or in the middle ages or those who are working already, trying to learn and upgrade themselves. We have to invest in them and give our rural areas an opportunity to catch up by at least providing them with the basic skills to get through the technology highway,” he said.
Huawei has long recognized the critical importance of providing everyone with digital skills and leaving no one behind as economies digitalize. Over the years, Huawei has launched multiple programs to train over 100,000 people with ICT empowerment in the region in cooperation with governments, universities, and NGOs. In the Philippines, during the past 4 years, more than 50 Philippine universities joined Huawei ICT Academy, over 6000 students benefited from the ICT training offered by Huawei.
Conveying the business perspective, Professor Jose Decolongon, COO & Managing Director of Corporate Foresight, Embiggen Consulting Philippines said “Micro, small, medium enterprises need to have understanding on digitalization to perceive the opportunities when it comes to exploring the digital side of the business. Challenges are faced by these enterprises but also the large organizations. It’s related to coverage and speed of digital infrastructure. This is where telecom players such as Huawei and our local players can play an important role.”
For a sustainable digital economic ecosystem, new technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things and Cloud provide great promise in terms of enhancing de-carbonization and the circular economy. In the Philippines, Huawei has increased investment in sustainable green solutions, leveraging clean power generation, electric transportation, and smart energy storage.
“The next five years could see the ASEAN region make giant strides towards becoming a digital society, and the transformation will enable member states to recover faster from the pandemic. Huawei, together with ASEAN partners, is committed to enabling the ASEAN Digital Master Plan 2025 and creating new value for the leading digital community and economic bloc,” said Jay.",1,,,"{'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'None': ['Association of Southeast Asian Nations'], 'BGD': ['Asia Pacific Blossom']}",tech_transfer_investment,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei']

Sustained Network Investments
The strategy to deploy 5G has been embedded in Smart’s network planning over the past five years. PLDT’s wireless subsidiary started conducting tests with 5G in 2016. In 2018, it fired up the country’s first 5G base stations in Makati with Huawei and the Clark Freeport Zone in Pampanga with Ericsson. Last year, Smart also launched the first Smart 5G Lifestyle hub and 5G-enabled shopping mall In Araneta City, as well as the first Smart 5G campus at the Ateneo de Manila University.
To actually execute the 5G deployment plan required a steady investment effort by PLDT and Smart that has amounted to nearly P260 billion in overall capital expenditure (capex) spend over the past five years. In 2019 alone, the PLDT Group’s capex reached a record Php72.9 billion. Moreover, 2020 capex is expected to reach Php70 billion despite the slowdown in network rollout due to the quarantine controls imposed in the second quarter of this year.
This capex program enabled PLDT and Smart to build the digital infrastructure needed to support the deployment first of 4G/LTE and later 5G. This involved, first of all, the deployment of an extensive optic fiber network. The PLDT Group’s fiber network is the most pervasive in the country and extends to over nearly 360,000 kilometers as of June 2020.
Moreover, PLDT has partnered with Cisco and Huawei, to transform its IP fiber transport infrastructure into a fully automated, software-defined 5G-ready network. This highly reliable, highly scalable infrastructure utilizing PLDT’s existing fiber network will enable PLDT to deliver next generation digital services like Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things via 5G.
With this extensive fiber network, Smart has been able to fast-track the nationwide roll out of its 4G/LTE service that when combined with its 3G service now provides high-speed mobile internet service to over 93% of the country’s cities and municipalities and 95% of the population. Moreover, in its ongoing LTE and LTE-Advanced roll-out, Smart has been installing 5G-capable equipment which will enable Smart to deploy 5G easier and faster.
“It has taken a lot of time and effort. But the future is now here,” Basas said.

Philippines,33614,mb.com.ph,2021-07-09T10:01:00Z,"Huawei announces Seeds for the Future Program 2.0, planning to invest US$150 million in talent development over the next five years – Manila Bulletin","Huawei recently announced its Seeds for the Future Program 2.0, through which Huawei plans to invest US$150 million in digital talent development over the next five years. This program is expected to benefit more than 3 million additional people
Huawei held a “Tech & Sustainability: Everyone’s Included” forum, co-hosted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Representatives from Huawei, IUCN, the World Economic Forum, Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), and Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA) participated to discuss the role of technology in driving sustainability and building a more inclusive, eco-friendly world.
Promoting equal access to education and talent development
According to a 2020 report by UNICEF and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), about 2.2 billion people aged 25 years or younger still lack internet connections at home.
“Digital skills and literacy are not just the foundation for the digital economy; they are also a basic human right defined by the United Nations,” said Huawei’s Chairman Liang Hua at the forum. “Today we are announcing Huawei’s Seeds for the Future Program 2.0. As part of our commitment to continuously developing talent, we will invest US$150 million in this program over the next five years and help college students and young people improve their digital skills. This program is expected to benefit more than 3 million additional people.”
Huawei is committed to helping develop digital talent in the countries where it operates. In 2008, Huawei began to roll out talent development programs, through scholarships, technology competitions, and digital skills training, and has invested more than US$150 million in these programs. Huawei has since benefited more than 1.54 million people from over 150 countries.
Initiated in 2008 in Thailand, the Seeds for the Future program is designed to inspire local talents and encourage seeds for the society to tackle digital challenges. The program has benefited more than 5,000 students across Asia Pacific.
As an echo for the forum, Huawei Asia Pacific held the APAC Media Virtual Roundtable with laser focus on addressing digital inclusion and sustainable development of this region. Jay Chen, Vice President of Huawei Asia Pacific, announced Huawei’s plan to cultivate more than 40,000 ICT talent in the next five years through multiple programs including Seeds for the Future in the region.
“In the digital economy, digital talent is playing an increasingly important role in driving digital transformation and economic growth. The access to education is vital for creating opportunities that support sustainable and fair development. Due to the pandemic, we are moving the program online and opening it up to more outstanding students than ever before,” said Jay Chen.
In Asia Pacific, Huawei has been a firm enabler for building an inclusive talent ecosystem. Huawei ASEAN Academy has been launched in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia since 2019, and cultivated more than 100,000 talents for preparing digital future. Amid the pandemic, according to Jay Chen, “collaborations with top universities are accelerating. Till now, Huawei has built collaborations with around 200 universities in countries across Asia Pacific.”
Addressing environmental challenges and enabling green development
Climate change and environmental issues are becoming global challenges. Though carbon emissions declined over the past year due to the economic slowdown and worldwide lockdowns, emissions are rapidly rebounding as economies reopen. Shifting to a circular economy and achieving sustainable development is now a common goal for all countries.
Huawei Chairman Liang Hua
“Green and sustainable development has become a top priority for global economies,” said Liang. “Huawei has been leveraging its extensive experience in power electronics and energy storage as well as technical expertise in 5G, cloud, and AI, to develop its digital power business and provide digital power solutions for different industries. As of December 2020, Huawei’s digital power products and solutions have generated 325 billion kWh of electricity from renewable sources, and saved a total of 10 billion kWh of electricity. These efforts have resulted in a reduction of 160 million tons in CO 2 emissions.”
In Singapore, for example, Huawei FusionSolar Solution has supported Sunseap Group, a solar energy solutions provider, to build the world’s largest offshore floating Photovoltaic (PV) farms. With 13,312 solar panels, 40 inverters, and more than 30,000 floats, this five-hectare sea-based solar plant is estimated to produce up to 6,022,500 kWh of energy per year, supplying enough power for 1250 four-room public housing flats on the island and offsetting an estimated 4258 tons of carbon dioxide, according to Bruce Li, Managing Director of the Huawei Asia-Pacific Enterprise Digital Power Business.
“By working together, countries can mutually support one another to meet their sustainability commitments. There are many areas where digital technology can support this, such as in enabling a transparent and verifiable carbon market. Singapore’s public and private sectors have expressed interest in working with its neighbors on climate action,” said Associate Professor Simon Tay, Chairman of SIIA at the forum.",1,,,"{'None': ['Asia'], 'THA': ['Kingdom of Thailand'], 'MYS': ['Malaysia'], 'IDN': ['Republic of Indonesia'], 'SGP': ['Republic of Singapore', 'Asia Pacific Breweries'], 'PHL': ['Manila']}",tech_transfer_investment,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei']
Philippines,8588,manilatimes.net,2016-05-03T22:05:08Z,Japan to lease military aircraft,"TOKYO: Japan will lease military aircraft to the Philippines in another sign of deepening security ties between the two former foes to counter Beijing’s increasing regional influence.
The agreement was made on Monday afternoon during telephone talks between Japan’s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and his Philippine counterpart Voltaire Gazmin, the ministry said.
Tensions in the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea) -- through which one-third of the world’s oil passes -- had mounted in recent years since China transformed contested reefs into artificial islands capable of supporting military facilities.
Under the accord, Tokyo will lease up to five TC-90 training airplanes and help Manila train pilots and aircraft mechanics, the ministry said.
The planes can be used as surveillance aircraft, according to local media.
It will be Japan’s first lease of its Self-Defense Forces’ aircraft to another country after it recently lifted a self-imposed ban on weapons exports.
“We agreed that it is important for all the countries in the region to strengthen cooperation in order to maintain peace and stability of the South China Sea,” Nakatani told reporters.
“We believe that improving the Philippines’ capability will lead to stability in the region,” he said.
The TC-90 is capable of flying some 1,900 kilometers, roughly double the flight range of the Philippine Navy’s aircraft, Kyodo News said.
The Philippines has been seeking to strengthen ties with Japan, its former World War II rival, as tensions mount over disputed South China Sea waters, almost all of which are claimed by China.
The Southeast Asian country has a severely under-equipped military.
Aside from the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and Taiwan also have overlapping claims to the contested waterway.
Japan has its own dispute with China in the East China Sea over uninhabited islands that it administers but that are also claimed by Beijing.
A Japanese warship last month sailed into a Philippine port near disputed South China Sea waters while Tokyo agreed in February to supply Manila with military hardware, which may include anti-submarine reconnaissance aircraft and radar technology.

Philippines,10699,inquirer.net,2016-11-03T00:05:59Z,Duterte turns to Russia for rifles,"President Duterte has belittled the decision of the US state department to halt the planned sale of more than 27,000 assault rifles to the Philippine National Police, saying the Philippines could just turn to Russia for firearms.
“Susmaryosep! Is that all?” the President told reporters after visiting the tombs of his parents in Davao City on Tuesday night.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Is that all they can say to threaten me? That they will not sell firearms to us? We have many air rifles here,” he said in jest.
The US state department stopped the planned sale of 27,304 M4 assault rifles to the PNP on Monday after Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin said he would oppose the transaction.
The state department informs the US Congress when international weapons sales are in the works. Aides said Senate foreign relations committee staff informed the state department that Cardin, the most senior Democrat on the committee, would oppose the deal with the Philippines during the department’s prenotification process for the sale of M4s, stopping the deal.
Rights violations
Aides said Cardin was reluctant for the United States to provide weapons to the Philippines given concerns about human rights violations in the country.
More than 3,700 people have been killed in police operations or by suspected vigilantes since Mr. Duterte took office and launched a brutal war on illegal drugs on June 30.
US criticism of Mr. Duterte’s violent campaign against drugs has angered the Philippine leader, who almost daily spews profanity-laced tirades against the United States, complicating relations between Washington and Manila.
Last month, during a state visit to Beijing, Mr. Duterte declared “separation” from the United States and realignment to China and Russia.
Before his trip to Beijing, Mr. Duterte said the United States had refused to sell some weapons to the Philippines, but he did not care because Russia and China were willing suppliers.
ADVERTISEMENT
In Davao City on Tuesday night, Mr. Duterte said his administration may turn to Russia for arming PNP personnel.
“Remember what the Russian diplomat said? ‘Come to Russia. We have everything you need,’” Mr. Duterte said, recounting his meeting in Davao with Russian Ambassador Igor Khovaev before the elections in May.

Russian light arms
The Russians have nothing like the short, light M4 assault rifle that fires the popular 5.56-millimeter cartridge.
But standard issue for Russian police forces is the Vityas-SN submachine gun, chambered for the 9×19-mm Parabellum round, and PP-2000, a police submachine gun that also fires the 9×19-mm Parabellum cartridge.
For police pistols, the Russians have the Yarygin PYa Grach chambered for the 9×19-mm Parabellum round and looks like a variant of the 9-mm Czech-made CZ SPO1.
Still standard issue for Russian police forces is the Makarov pistol, chambered for the 9×18-mm Makarov cartridge, which is little known in the Philippines.
For rifles, the Russians can offer the PNP, and maybe the Philippine Army and the Marines, various versions of the AK-47, the latest of which is the AKM-47, which is chambered for the heavy 7.62×39-mm cartridge.
PNP still wants M4s
Even so, the PNP is not yet giving up hope that it could get M4s.
The national police chief told reporters on Wednesday that the US supplier, SIG Sauer, had told the PNP that as of Nov. 1, the export license for the M4 sale was still “undergoing the normal process” in the US state department.
“We will continue to monitor the status of this license and advice of any meaningful changes,” said PNP Director General Ronald dela Rosa.
“We don’t yet have an official notice confirming the alleged halting of the procurement. For now, the delivery will push through,” he said.
Dela Rosa said the M4s were intended for the PNP campaign against private armed groups, not for Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs.
In a radio interview earlier on Wednesday, Dela Rosa said his men could use pistols
or even their fists in fighting drug suspects.
Dela Rosa said his only regret should the M4 deal fall through would be “the time lost,” as the government would have to conduct another competitive bidding for a new contract for M4s from another source.
In a news briefing at Malacañang on Wednesday, presidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella, commenting on Cardin’s concern about the human rights situation in the Philippines, said President Duterte had invited the United Nations to investigate.
“However, the invitation itself does not preclude a careful process on procedures to be agreed upon between the Philippine government and the [United Nations],” Abella said.

China has offered P720-million ($14.4-million) worth of military aid to boost President Rodrigo Duterte’s anti-terror and anti-drug campaign.

The financial aid from China was among the things discussed with Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jianhua when President Rodrigo Duterte and Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana met him in Malacañang on Monday night.
“They want to help us fight terrorism and drugs. Tutulungan nila si President (They will help the President). Sabi niya kay Presidente kagabi (He told the President last night), ‘I know your problems in terrorism. I know your problems on drugs so we would like to help you,’” Lorenzana told reporters.
“We were given a list of equipment to choose from. Maybe we can get small arms, fast boats or night vision goggles,” he added.
The defense secretary said they are looking into finalizing the list of equipment before yearend, while the transfer of the free items is expected by first or second quarter of 2017.
Relations between China and Philippines have started to become friendly when Duterte became President, a turnaround from their sour relations over the South China Sea dispute.
China has also offered $500-million or P25-billion worth of long-term soft loan.
“Kung kailangan pa natin ng equipment, pwede pa tayong umutang sa kanila ng soft loan (If we need more equipment, we can get a soft loan from them),” Lorenzana said, but details have yet to be discussed.
Aside from the financial aid, China has also offered to put up another drug rehabilitation center in Mindanao.
A drug rehabilitation center built at Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija, was also funded by a Chinese tycoon. CDG/rga

Philippines,5422,manilastandard.net,2014-12-14T00:01:00Z,First 2 Korean jets to arrive next year,"AFTER 10 years without a fighter jet in its arsenal, President Benigno Aquino III said the country will take delivery of two FA-50 jets from Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd., the first batch of 12 multi-role light fighters the country acquired from South Korea. “Next year, the first two units of these moderns jets will land in the country for the Armed Forces,” the President said in his arrival speech at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 2. “The last time we had fighters in the inventory was in 2005 so by next year an entire decade has already passed,” Aquino said, adding that the delivery of the 10 remaining units will be completed in 2017. The entire squadron costs P18.9 billion. Aquino inspected one of the FA-50 fighter jets at the Gimhae Airbase in Busan, South Korea where he met with Korea Aerospace Industries president Sung Yong-ha and several Korean Air Force officials. He was in Busan for the commemorative summit between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Republic of Korea on its 25th anniversary.Talking to reporters before returning to Manila, Aquino said he was informed that China had tried to pressure South Korea not to sell the 12 jets to the Philippines. “I might be paraphrasing, but [the Koreans] didn’t agree to the request to stop the sale,” Aquino said. The purchase of the jets is part of a five-year, P75-billion ($1.68 billion) modernization program, but Philippine officials have insisted that the acquisition had nothing to do with Manila’s maritime dispute with Beijing. The FA-50 is the most advanced version of the T-50, South Korea’s first indigenous supersonic aircraft used to train pilots in the more advanced F-15 and F-16 fighter jets, but it can be fitted with advanced medium-range air-to-air or beyond-visual range missiles.",0,,,"{'KOR': ['Republic of Korea', 'Busan'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Ninoy Aquino Manila International Airport']}",arms_transfer_security_aid_assistance,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing']
Philippines,27883,mb.com.ph,2020-07-07T01:06:42Z,Xi raises 'negative factors' in call with Trump – Manila Bulletin,"Chinese President Xi Jinping told US counterpart Donald Trump on Monday that Sino-US relations have been hit by “negative factors” in a phone call following days of US actions that have vexed Beijing.Trump held separate calls with Xi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that focused on tensions on the Korean peninsula, but China’s foreign ministry said Xi also invoked the thorny issue of Taiwan.Trump infuriated Beijing last week when he approved a $1.3 billion arms sales to Taiwan, a self-governed island that Beijing considers a breakaway province awaiting reunification.The US administration also imposed sanctions on a Chinese bank accused of laundering North Korean cash, voiced concern about freedom in semi-autonomous Hong Kong and placed the country on a list of the world’s worst human trafficking offenders.The latest irritant came on Sunday when the USS Stethem destroyer sailed less than 12 nautical miles from tiny Triton Island in the Paracel Islands archipelago, which is claimed by China as well as Taiwan and Vietnam, a US official told AFP.The series of moves have marked a sharp reversal from the friendly tone struck by Trump since his meeting with Xi at the US president’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in April.In their phone call, Xi acknowledged that Sino-US relations “have achieved important results” since that meeting, the foreign ministry said.But Xi also warned that relations “have been affected by some negative factors”.Xi said he hoped the US president will “properly handle” Taiwan issues in accordance with the “One China” principle.The Chinese leader insisted that the two sides should follow the “consensus” reached at Mar-a-Lago and adhere to the principle of mutual respect.“President Trump raised the growing threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program,” the White House said.“Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula,” it said.Trump, who berated Beijing over trade during the US election campaign, also “reiterated his determination to seek more balanced trade relations with America’s trading partners”.The two leaders discussed “a range of other regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest” and indicated the two would meet at the Group of 20 summit in Germany this week, the White House said.Trump has pressed Xi to use China’s diplomatic and economic clout over North Korea to pressure the Stalinist state to abandon its nuclear program, but the US leader tweeted last month that Beijing’s efforts had failed.The phone call came hours after the “freedom of navigation” operation in the South China Sea, an operation meant to assert the right to sail in disputed waters.The move prompted China to deploy military vessels and fighter jets, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a statement late Sunday, calling the US operation a “serious political and military provocation”.It was the second operation of its kind carried out by the United States since Trump took office.The latest US exercise came as Beijing continues muscular efforts to cement its claim to nearly all of the South China Sea, parts of which are also claimed by Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam.China has rapidly built reefs in the area into artificial islands capable of hosting military planes.On May 25, a US guided-missile destroyer sailed less than 12 nautical miles from a disputed reef — within the distance commonly accepted as constituting the territorial waters of a landmass.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'Paracel Islands'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan'], 'VNM': ['Socialist Republic of Vietnam', 'South China Sea'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Florida'], 'PRK': ['Democratic People’s Republic of Korea'], 'DEU': ['Federal Republic of Germany'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Triton Island'], 'BRN': ['Brunei Darussalam'], 'MYS': ['Malaysia'], 'HKG': ['Hong Kong']}",arms_transfer_security_aid_assistance,"['Xi Jinping', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,17834,inquirer.net,2018-09-13T22:00:31Z,Asean military spending not really about China,"HÀ NỘI – Although Southeast Asia countries are spending more on military defense equipment, it doesn’t mean they are increasing the risk of conflict in the region, according to Tim Huxley, Executive Director at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
Speaking at a session on understanding Asia’s new balance of power, one of the activities as part of the 2018 World Economic Forum on Asean in Hà Nội, Huxley revealed some surprising numbers on regional arms spending.
ADVERTISEMENT
In 2017, Southeast Asian countries spend more than US$39 billion on defense. According to Felix Heiduk from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, total defense spending of Asean states doubled over the last 15 years in absolute terms, with countries like Indonesia and Thailand witnessing military expenditure growth rates of 10 percent year-on-year.
But Huxley said there’s no need to panic yet.
“They are mainly doing this commensurately with their economic growth, which has been famously rapid for most of the current century,” he said.
He also pointed out that while the widespread impression was that regional states’ escalating military spending was about China, it was actually misleading.
No other regional state comes close to competing with China, which in 2017 alone spent $151 billion on arms, he pointed out.
For example, despite its tiny size, Singapore is by far the biggest defense spender in Southeast Asia, outspending even Indonesia, which has 45 times more people. Yet Singapore has no territorial claims in the South China Sea, he said.
“Southeast Asian countries might not need military equipment for the same reasons as western countries. For some countries it might be countering insurgents, for others it might be countering internal political issues,” he said.
When asked about how Asean has prepared for a potential conflict between major powers in the South China Sea (called East Sea by Việt Nam), Tim said he saw very little.
“I don’t see any Asean preparation for this or willingness to do this. There would be consultation among members but as a whole they have been unable to present a strong common front on the issue of the South China Sea and this has helped China get away with it,” Tim said.
ADVERTISEMENT
He cited the fact that in reality China had continued to militarize islands, deploying military aircrafts and missiles to the area.
“And there’s no sign that is going to stop,” he said.
On the matter, Robert Girrier, President of the US’s Pacific Forum, reminded that the ruling of the Arbitral Tribunal on the case of China and the Philippines was a clear statement, and that there needs to be a multilateral mechanism to challenge China’s stake on the South China Sea.

Philippines,5112,inquirer.net,2014-10-03T13:11:13Z,US lifts 40-year arms ban to boost Vietnam sea defense,"WASHINGTON–In a decision likely to anger China, the US is partly lifting a 40-year ban on arms sales to former foe Vietnam to help boost defenses in the tense South China Sea.
The historic easing of the ban in place since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 will only apply to maritime equipment, State Department officials stressed, and comes amid warming ties and as Hanoi makes “modest” improvements to human rights.
ADVERTISEMENT
“What’s driving this is not a sudden desire to transfer military equipment to Vietnam writ large, but a specific need in the region,” said one official, highlighting what he called Vietnam’s lack of capacity in the disputed waters and America’s own national security interests.
“It’s useful in trying to deal with the territorial disputes in the South China Sea to bolster the capacity of our friends in the region to maintain a maritime presence in some capacity.”
Some 40 percent of the world’s seaborne trade passes through the sea which is claimed in part by Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia, as well as China and the Philippines.
‘Destabilizing actions’
Although the United States has not taken sides in the territorial disputes, it has warned Beijing against “destabilizing actions” amid a series of tense maritime incidents.
Earlier this year, Beijing placed an oil rig in waters also claimed by Vietnam, sparking deadly riots in the Southeast Asian nation.
Secretary of State John Kerry informed his Vietnamese counterpart Pham Binh Min during talks Thursday of Washington’s move to adjust the current policy “to allow the transfer of defense equipment, including lethal defense equipment, for maritime security purposes only,” a senior State Department official said.
Kerry later praised “the transformation” in Vietnam since the US normalized diplomatic relations two decades ago, calling it “nothing short of amazing.”
“Vietnam has become a modern nation and an important partner of the United States. And (when) we talk to the young people in Vietnam you can feel the enthusiasm for the potential of the future,” he told a US-ASEAN business council dinner.
ADVERTISEMENT
Not ‘anti-China’
A prohibition on sales of other kinds of lethal weapons, such as tanks, will stay in place as Washington pushes Hanoi to improve its human rights record.
“Vietnam will need to make additional progress on human rights for the United States to consider a full lift of the ban on lethal defense articles in the future,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.
US officials denied the policy change was “anti-China” and insisted they had no specific sales to outline so far, but would consider each request from Hanoi on a case-by-case basis.
And they sought to allay any concerns from Beijing, saying it was purely a defensive measure.
“We’re not talking about destabilizing systems, we’re talking about defensive capabilities… These are not things that are going to tip the regional balance,” a second State Department official said, also asking not to be named.
Any sales would be done in close consultation with the US Congress, and would be heavily focused on equipping the Vietnamese coast guard, the State Department officials said.
So far, Washington has only been allowed to sell unarmed patrol boats to the Vietnamese coastguard since a total ban on military sales was lifted in 2006. That could now change, for example, the officials said.
And they acknowledged that airborne defense systems would also be considered for sale if they included a maritime capacity.
“This policy supports Vietnam’s efforts to improve its maritime domain awareness and maritime security capabilities,” Psaki told reporters.
Officials said, however, that the easing of the ban did not mean all arms sales were now on the table to the communist-run county amid continuing concerns about rights such as freedom of expression and religion.
“It’s not an indication that we are going to provide all lethal assistance now. It just simply says we can remove what has been a hinderance to our ability to provide legitimate maritime capacity,” the second unnamed State Department official said.

Philippines,11355,inquirer.net,2017-01-18T01:50:41Z,PH troubled by China arms buildup in Spratlys,"China’s recent installation of weapons on artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea was “very troubling,” Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said on Tuesday, after Manila quietly protested Beijing’s activities.
The Department of Foreign Affairs sent a note verbale to the Chinese Embassy last month after confirming a report from the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies about China’s arms buildup in the Spratlys.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The actions of China in militarizing those disputed features are very troubling,” Lorenzana said in a statement. “They do not square with the Chinese government’s rhetoric that its purpose is peaceful and friendly.”
“The Philippine government would be remiss in its duty to protect its national interest if it does not protest, question and seek clarification from China on the presence of weapons in the Spratlys,” he said.
He took a stronger line than Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay, who refrained from criticizing China on Tuesday but said the issue had to be handled carefully and the public should know “we are not sleeping on the job.”
Balancing act
“When something happens that can pose us some kind of threat to our sovereignty rights, we issue a note verbale so we can talk about it and make sure it is properly addressed,” Yasay said.
With billions of dollars of potential Chinese trade and investment at stake, the Philippines has a difficult balancing act in upholding its sovereignty claims while staying on the better terms that President Duterte has established with historic rival China.
The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (Amti), a US think tank, has also said it has been tracking construction of hexagonal structures on Kagitingan (Fiery Cross), Panganiban (Mischief) and Zamora (Subi) reefs since June and July last year. China has built airstrips on these islands, capable of accommodating large military aircraft.
It said China has placed modern weapons on Panganiban, which is located within the Philippines’ 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
Lorenzana said some of the reclaimed areas mentioned in the Amti report were within the country’s EEZ. The Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of Manila in July last year, saying Beijing had no historical title to the vast maritime region.
For its part, the Philippines has decided to shelve planned upgrades to facilities on islands it controls, such as repairing an eroded runway, to avoid incurring China’s wrath.
ADVERTISEMENT
Lorenzana said a diplomatic protest was the correct procedure and despite warming relations with China, the government still had a duty to protect the national interest.
China claims most of the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion of goods passes annually. An international arbitration ruling last year invalidated those claims.
China’s artificial islands became a hot issue last week when the US nominee for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, told a Senate hearing that Beijing should be repelled from, and then denied access to, the controversial islets.
Yasay last week suggested Manila would play no part in that, and said of the United States, “Let them do it”. —WITH THE WIRES

Salakot to include Antonio Bautista Air Base in Puerto Princesa City, Palawan (Lot 1) and at the Paredes Air Station in Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte (Lot 2). Both radar stations are facing the West Philippine Sea where the Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal in Masinloc, Zambales and the Kalayaan Islands Group in Palawan are situated.

MANILA — China has made available firearms for Philippine state forces in an apparent move to further bolster its good relations with the Duterte administration amid the continuing territorial dispute between the two countries over the West Philippine Sea.
ADVERTISEMENT
President Duterte disclosed this Sunday night in his speech before personnel of the Northern Luzon Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) at Camp Servillano Aquino in Tarlac City.
It was not clear, however, what kind of guns the Philippine government would acquire from Beijing as Mr. Duterte did not provide details of the arms deal.
“China is pressing me. The firearms are already available for me to receive. They are really prodding me,” the President said in a mix of English and Filipino.
He said he directed Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana to send a military general to formally receive the guns from Beijing.
“The firearms are already there and (China) really wants to give them to us. So it’s really now easy for us. We don’t have to ask (help) from other (countries),” said Mr. Duterte.
The Commander-in-Chief said Beijing offered the guns through a 25-year grant to the Philippine government.
Said the President: “If it’s a grant payable in 25 years, that’s practically giving… It’s obvious that China wanted to give us (firearms).”
Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Duterte chose to be friendly with China as part of what he described as his administration’s efforts to pursue an independent foreign policy.
In his state visit to Beijing last October, the President told a group of Chinese businessmen and government officials that he had decided to separate from the US “both in military and economics,” much to the delight of his Chinese host.
Upon the President’s return to Manila, Beijing immediately announced it would allow small fishermen to enter the disputed Scarborough Shoal, a resource-rich area clearly within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone. SFM

Philippines,37222,manilastandard.net,2023-02-25T22:00:00Z,Biden says he does not ‘anticipate’ China providing weapons to Russia,"US President Joe Biden said he does not “anticipate a major initiative” from China to provide weapons to Russia in its war against Ukraine.
His comments come days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CBS that China was “considering providing lethal support” to Moscow ranging “from ammunition to the weapons themselves” – which Beijing denied.
In a wide-ranging television interview with ABC News – covering his bid for re-election and the war in Ukraine – that aired Friday evening, Biden appeared to backtrack on Blinken’s comments.
“I don’t anticipate – we haven’t seen it yet – but I don’t anticipate a major initiative on the part of China providing weaponry to Russia,” he said.
Biden explained that in a conversation he had with Chinese PresidentXi Jinping last summer, he made clear what the consequences ofproviding weapons to Russia would be.

“Without any government prodding, 600 American corporations left Russia – from McDonald’s to Exxon – across the board,” he said he told Xi.
“And I said, ‘If you are engaged in the same kind of brutality, of supporting the brutality that is going on, you may face the sameconsequences.’”
When pressed on whether China would be “crossing a line” if Beijingwere to provide weapons to Russia, Biden said the United States “would respond.”
“It would be the same line everyone else would have crossed. In other words, we would impose severe sanctions on anyone who has done it.”
Ukraine’s allies have sought to use sanctions and trade bans to choke off Russia’s ability to acquire more weapons or produce them domestically using imported components.
On Friday, the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion, leaders of the Group of 7 industrialized nations said any country abetting Moscow by providing “material support” in its war would “face severe costs.”

Philippines,8168,manilastandard.net,2016-03-12T00:01:00Z,Palace defends plan to lease patrol planes,"Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr.
DESPITE China’s opposition to the government’s plan to lease five military patrol planes from Japan, Malacañang insisted the plan is legal and internationally accepted. “It is the duty of government to continuously develop our capabilities in ensuring the safety and security of our nation,” said Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. in a text message to the Malacañang Press Corps.“Lease or other forms of acquisition from regional partners and allies is but a usual activity of any country,” Coloma said. “This is a legal and internationally accepted process of acquisition by governments.” Coloma issued the state after Beijing on Thursday accused Tokyo of interfering in the South China Sea after Manila said it would lease five Japanese military plans to patrol areas it claims in the heavily disputed waters. Beijing claims almost all of the strategically vital South China Sea, and is embroiled in a separate row with Tokyo over disputed islands in the East China Sea that has seen relations between the Asian powers sour badly in recent years. President Benigno Aquino III said Wednesday that Manila would lease five TC-90 training aircraft from Japan to “help our navy patrol our territory”, pointing out the disputed area in particular. China’s foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Beijing was “firmly opposed” to challenges to its sovereignty and security and would “remain on high alert.” “Japan is not a party directly concerned in the South China Sea dispute,” he added. “We urge the Japanese side to mind its words and actions and refrain from undermining the peace and stability of the region,” he said. Tensions in the South China Sea—through which one-third of the world’s oil passes—have mounted in recent months since China transformed contested Spratly reefs into artificial islands capable of supporting military facilities.China claims almost all of sea, including those Spratly islands currently controlled by the Philippines. Several other littoral state have competing claims in the region, as does Taiwan. Aquino—whose government has infuriated Beijing by taking the South China Sea issue to an international tribunal in The Hague—is looking to upgrade one of Asia’s most badly equipped armed forces. Hong’s comments came after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said there were “little grounds for optimism” in Sino-Japanese relations and accused the world’s third-largest economy -- a major Chinese trading partner -- of “two-faced” behavior. “On the one hand the Japanese government and leaders are constantly claiming they want to improve Sino-Japanese relations, and on the other are constantly making trouble for China everywhere,” Wang said Tuesday on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress (NPC), the country’s Communist-controlled legislature. “This is actually a kind of approach typical of a ‘two-faced person’.”",0,,,"{'None': ['Asia', 'Spratly Islands'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'South China Basin'], 'JPN': ['Japan', 'Tokyo'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan', 'East China Sea'], 'NLD': ['The Hague']}",arms_transfer_security_aid_assistance,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,15448,manilatimes.net,2018-03-05T23:20:13Z,China hikes defense spending,"BEIJING: China announced on Monday an 8.1 percent defense budget increase for 2018, giving a boost to the modernization of the world’s largest military after spending slowed in the previous two years.Beijing will splash out 1.11 trillion yuan ($175 billion) on its military, according to a budget report presented before the opening session of the annual National People’s Congress.“We will stick to the Chinese path in strengthening our armed forces, advance all aspects of military training and war preparedness, and firmly and resolvedly safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests,” Premier Li Keqiang said in a report to the legislature.China’s neighbors and the United States have watched warily as Beijing has modernized its military, reducing its ground troops while spending on state-of-the-art hardware and weapons.Li said the military had completed its goal of slashing troop numbers by 300,000, leaving the People’s Liberation Army with a two-million-strong force.At the same time, Beijing has imposed increasingly assertive claims to vast expanses of the contested South China Sea, while engaging in confrontations with Japan over disputed islands in the East China Sea and with India over Himalayan border regions.The 2018 outlay compares with a seven percent increase last year and 7.6 percent in 2016, which marked the first time in six years that spending growth was not in double figures.China spent $151 billion on the PLA last year, the second largest defense budget in the world but still four times less than the $603 billion US outlay, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank.The defense budget increase has roughly kept pace with China’s national economic output in recent years. The economy grew by 6.9 percent in 2017 and the government said Monday it will target growth of around 6.5 percent in 2018.“We can expect that China’s defense budget will continue to be subordinated to, and coordinated with, China’s economic performance. It will likely not be over-militarized,” said James Char, a military expert at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University.‘World-class’ armyAs the PLA marked its 90th anniversary in August, Xi warned that China will protect its sovereignty against “any people, organization or political party.”Since coming to power in 2012, the president has trumpeted the need to build a stronger combat-ready military, while cementing his leadership over the army, which was ordered to pledge absolute loyalty to him last year.At a major Communist Party congress in October, Xi vowed to build a “world-class” fighting force by 2050.The PLA has stocked up on stealth fighter jets, warships and high-tech weaponry over the years.“Technologically speaking, the PLA has progressed markedly in recent years, with its own research and development in military hardware and growing professionalism reducing the gap with its US counterpart,” Char said.Last year, China unveiled its first domestically-built aircraft carrier, which will carry J-15 fighters that will take off from a raised “ski jump” platform. It also launched a new class of destroyer.Its military has one operational carrier—the Liaoning—a Soviet-era vessel bought from Ukraine that was refitted and commissioned in 2012.The chairman of the Dalian Shipbuilding Industry, which worked on both ships, said the company was “ready to build larger” carriers after gaining the experience to make more, the state-run China Daily newspaper said Friday.China has also opened its first overseas military base in the Horn of Africa country of Djibouti.Since 2008, its navy has participated in anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden.Closer to home, China has in recent years built artificial islands—with airstrips—capable of hosting military installations in the South China Sea, inflaming tensions with its Southeast Asian neighbors.US warships, meanwhile, regularly conduct “freedom of navigation” operations near the islands to challenge China’s territorial claims.Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan have contested China’s claims to the sea.China’s military budget is “disproportional in the sense that the economies of Southeast Asia do not have the resources to keep pace” and Japan’s constitution restricts military spending, said Matthew Funaiole, a fellow with the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington.“Whether or not this is a ‘threat’ depends on how China utilizes its capabilities.

Not only education, not only health, but also the protection of what is supposed to be ours,” the lawmaker stressed, adding that the government should identify the needs of security forces, such as shops, Coast Guard support, helicopters, and other essential resources.He added that this would help the country avoid further bullying from other regions.For now, Gonzales said all the Philippines can do is file diplomatic protests.Gonzales echoed this but reiterated that all the country can do for now is file diplomatic protests.For her part, Taguig City 2nd District Rep. Amparo Maria Zamora said that the country should continue its weekly resupply mission and resist Chinese bullying tactics. Not doing so would mean “surrender of territorial claims,” she added.“Regardless of China’s bullying tactics, we should stand up against bullies, right? It’s crucial that we don’t halt our activities, no matter what harm they inflict upon us,” Zamora said in Filipino.Meanwhile, 1-Rider Party-list Rep. Rodge Gutierrez, a member of the Special Committee on WPS, said that legislative efforts are already pertaining to the passing of Maritime Zones Law.“As for the question of the diplomatic protest being the pinnacle of our response, I will have to say that perhaps we should understand that the Philippine President, as the Chief Architect of Foreign Policy, has the final say on what we can and cannot do,” Gutierrez said.On Tuesday, the China Coast Guard (CCG) attacked a Philippine vessel again using water cannon on its way to bring supplies to troops in the grounded BRP Sierra Madre.The attack came after the Philippine vessel and China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels collided  during a “rotation and reprovisioning operation” (Rore) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.Subscribe to our daily newsletterBy providing an email address.

Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the Chinese weapons were supposed to go to the military, but President Duterte felt the police needed them more.
ADVERTISEMENT
“We are lucky that the Chinese government provided the firearms,” Lorenzana said at a news conference, where stacks of rifles were on display.
The M4 rifles will be turned over to the Philippine National Police for the use of its special units and not for policemen on foot patrol carrying out the government’s war against illegal drugs, according to AFP chief of staff Gen. Eduardo Año.
The turnover ceremonies took place on Thursday at Camp Aguinaldo with Año, Lorenzana and Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua.
Aside from the assault rifles, the Chinese government also donated 3 million rounds of ammunition and 90 scopes for the sniper rifles that were part of the first batch of weapons donated by China in June and received by Mr. Duterte himself.
The donation was coursed through the defense ministries of the two governments so that it would be the Department of National Defense and the AFP that would turn over the weapons to the PNP.
“The donation is military to military so it stands to reason that we should receive it first, then to be received by the chief of staff,” Lorenzana said.
Lorenzana also said that it was the President who “directed” that the weapons be given to the PNP after its scuttled purchase of 26,000 assault rifles from the United States last year.
The US state department stopped the transaction with the PNP last year after two US senators proposed to restrict sales of firearms to the Philippines, raising concerns over human rights violations resulting from the government’s unrepentant war against illegal drugs that has claimed the lives of thousands of poor Filipinos.

This is a very urgent concern,” said Romualdez, whose district includes Tacloban City which was wiped out by Yolanda.Romualdez, head of the Independent Minority Bloc in the House of Representatives, said hospital ships equipped with the latest medical and surgical facilities “can enhance also the government’s health care program even in the most isolated islands”.Earlier, Romualdez lauded the Chinese government for sending its Peace Ark Hospital Ship to Leyte as a humanitarian gesture despite the fragile relationship between the Manila and Beijing following the territorial disputes in the West Philippine Sea.Albano, of the House opposition bloc, said hospital ships are badly needed now compared to fighter jets.“We had witnessed how destructive and powerful these recent calamities were.Hospital ships can take care of the injured and sick people especially with the continued absence of modern medical care system in remote islands and shoreline communities,” he said. “The government must also set aside funds for the acquisition of heavy equipment.”Western Samar Rep.

Different parts of the waters around the Spratly Islands off southern China are being contested by the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.
Xinhua said China’s four warships would undertake training exercises that included “command post establishment, operational maneuvering from the sea and high-sea convoy missions.”
Quoting Jiang Weilie, commander of the People’s Liberation Army’s South China Sea fleet, Xinhua said warships Jinggangshan, Lanzhou, Yulin and Hengshui were deployed for the war drills on March 19.
“The training exercises will be conducted according to requirements of actual combat, with the aim of improving the navy’s defense capabilities based on the information system and enhancing its ability to safeguard maritime sovereignty,” Xinhua quoted Jiang in its report.
Xinhua described the Jinggangshan as “China’s most advanced amphibious transport dock” with the heaviest haul capability. The Lanzhou and Hengshui are expected to proceed to the Gulf of Aden, the pirate-infested waters off Somalia.
Amid tensions over rival maritime claims in the region, the presence of US military forces in the Philippines is expected to increase.
Del Rosario said Carter, accompanied by several other defense and military officials, assured him of America’s support for the country’s efforts to strengthen our military and its ability to defend our country.
Del Rosario said Carter had said “the US stands solidly behind the efforts of the Philippines to resolve the maritime disputes in the West Philippine Sea in a peaceful manner and consistent with the rule of law.”

“I welcomed Dr. Carter’s strong support for our efforts at peacefully settling the maritime disputes in the West Philippine Sea. We are committed to seeing this through,” said Del Rosario.
He was referring to the Philippines’ arbitration case against China to stop the latter’s incursions in the West Philippine Sea and to invalidate the Chinese nine-dash line claiming almost all the islands in the contested waters, including those within Philippine maritime
borders.
During the meeting, the DFA said the officials agreed to step up capacity building efforts for the Philippine military, saying “it is important that there be an increase in the number of exercises and other approved activities between the military and defense establishments of the two countries.”
“The increased rotational presence [of US forces] will be crucial in allowing us to maximize our own investment in our defense,” said Del Rosario.
“We will be able to increase and maximize the value and returns of the P75 billion the President (Benigno Aquino III) has allocated for our defense for the next five years,” he said.
The US is the country’s closest defense partner, continuing cooperation under the Mutual Defense Treaty for more than 60 years now. Last year, the US State Department guaranteed to double its foreign military allocation for the Philippines from $15 million to $30 million.

BEIJING: The United States Navy and Marine Corps are holding joint exercises in the South China Sea at a time of heightened tensions with Beijing over the shooting down of a suspected Chinese spy balloon.
The 7th Fleet based in Japan said Sunday that the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group and the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit have been conducting ""integrated expeditionary strike force operations"" in the South China Sea.
It said exercises involving ships, ground forces and aircraft took place Saturday but gave no details on when they began or whether they had ended.
China claims virtually the entire South China Sea and strongly objects to military activity by other nations in the contested waterway through which $5 trillion in goods are shipped every year.
The US takes no official position on sovereignty in the South China Sea, but maintains that freedom of navigation and overflight must be preserved.

Several times a year, it sends ships sailing past fortified Chinese outposts in the Spratly Islands, prompting protests from Beijing.
The US has also been strengthening its defense alliance with the Philippines, which has faced encroachment on the islands and fisheries by the Chinese coast guard and nominally civilian but government-backed fleets.
The military exercises were planned in advance.
They come as already tense relations between Washington and Beijing have been exacerbated by a diplomatic row sparked by the balloon, which was shot down last weekend in US airspace off the coast of South Carolina.
The US said the unmanned balloon was equipped to detect and collect intelligence signals, but Beijing insists it was a weather research airship that had accidentally blown off course.
The balloon prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to abruptly cancel a high-stakes trip to Beijing aimed at easing tensions.
After first issuing a highly rare expression of regret over the balloon, China has toughened its rhetoric, calling the US shootdown an overreaction and a violation of international norms.
China's defense minister refused to take a phone call from US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to discuss the matter.
The United States has since blacklisted six Chinese entities it said were linked to Beijing's aerospace programs as part of its response to the incident.
The House of Representatives also voted unanimously to condemn China for a ""brazen violation"" of US sovereignty and efforts to ""deceive the international community through false claims about its intelligence collection campaigns.""
The balloon was part of a large surveillance program that China has been conducting for several years, the Pentagon said.
The US says Chinese balloons have flown over dozens of countries across five continents in recent years, and it learned more about the balloon program after closely monitoring the one shot down near South Carolina.
In its news release, the 7th Fleet said the joint operation had ""established a powerful presence in the region, which supports peace and stability.""
""As a ready response force, we underpin a broad spectrum of missions, including landing Marines ashore, humanitarian disaster relief, and deterring potential adversaries through visible and present combat power,"" the release said.",1,,,"{'USA': ['United States', 'Washington', 'South China'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'South China Basin'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila'], 'JPN': ['Japan'], 'None': ['Spratly Islands']}",joint_security_force_exercise,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,1927,inquirer.net,2013-02-08T00:06:09Z,"US, allies in show of force","ANDERSEN AIR FORCE BASE, Guam—Fighter jets from the United States and two key allies roared into western Pacific skies on Thursday in the combat phase of annual exercises that have gained importance as the region responds to the rise of China and other potential threats.
The Cope North drills—which could soon swell in participants—are aimed at preparing air forces of the United States, Japan and Australia to fight together if a military crisis erupts.

They also send a vivid reminder to Beijing that America’s regional alliances are strong, though officers leading the maneuvers say they are not looking to bait the Chinese military.
“The training is not against a specific country, like China,” Japan Air Self-Defense Force Lt. Gen. Masayuki Hironaka said. “However, I think [the fact] that our alliance with the US and Australia is healthy is a strong message.”
The three allies began flying sorties together earlier in the week around the US territory of Guam in a humanitarian phase of the exercises, dropping emergency assistance in packages that wafted down under parachutes to jungle airfields.
On Thursday, fighter jets were joined by bombers, transport planes and tankers that refuel the fighters in midair. For the first time, Japanese tankers were joining the drills.
US officials said they believe more allies, particularly New Zealand and the Philippines, will join the exercises soon.
Maneuvers like Cope North are a key element of Washington’s evolving strategy in the Pacific as the United States shifts its emphasis away from Afghanistan and fighting ground wars.
Focus on Asia
The United States is now placing more attention on Asia and the possibility of an air or sea confrontation with the rapidly modernizing Chinese military, which has been briskly improving its forces and using its growing muscle to back up territorial claims that have raised regional tensions.
This “Pacific rebalance” will bring newer and more advanced aircraft and ships to the Pacific theater over the next several years and spread out the tens of thousands of US troops now primarily based in Japan and South Korea.

US Marines have already begun rotational deployments to Darwin, in northern Australia, and about 9,000 Marines stationed on the southern Japan island of Okinawa are to be moved to this tiny island, Hawaii and other locations.
The changes reflect a deepening strategic concern over the rise of China as a regional military power with the potential to challenge America’s ability to intervene in a crisis, particularly around Taiwan or islands in the south and east China seas that are contested by China and US allies such as the Philippines and Japan.
But the emphasis on alliance-building through exercises like Cope North also underscores fears in the Pentagon that major budget cuts looming in Congress could make it difficult for Washington to shoulder the whole burden of keeping China in check.
The Pacific Air Forces commander, Gen. Herbert Carlisle, said the budget cuts now being considered could threaten America’s role as a superpower.
China buildup
Carlisle noted that China’s military, and especially its navy, have been undergoing a “massive buildup” and are becoming a more credible challenge to their US counterparts.
So, strategic alliances are now more important than ever.
“The United States and our partners are taking ‘joint’ to the next level,” Carlisle said. “The amount of commerce that goes through here, the amount of the world GDP that goes through here, if you look at the world’s population that is in this part of the world, the importance of the Pacific can’t be overstated.”
Washington’s renewed focus on Asia has generally been welcomed by its more established and prosperous allies—like Japan and Australia—because they share the US concerns that changes in the balance of power could hurt economic growth throughout the region.
“I think nations throughout the region are looking for that increased support that working with the US is likely to bring,” said Royal Australian Air Force Air Commodore Anthony Grady. “Australia welcomes the refocus.”
Japanese defense
Japan also has a more urgent need to tout its US alliance.
Its Coast Guard ships and fighter aircraft have been deployed frequently over the past several months to drive their Chinese counterparts away from a group of small uninhabited islands that both nations claim as their own.
The dispute has soured diplomatic and trade relations and shows no sign of abating.
Under a treaty, the United States is obliged to come to Japan’s assistance if the islands are attacked or occupied.
Hironaka noted that during Cope North, which involves about 1,700 troops, Japanese fighter jets will conduct needed bombing training that they cannot do in their own country because of crowding and safety restrictions.
“Training with the US is very important to us,” he said. “The US-Japan alliance is key to security in the region.”
Not all Asian nations have been so receptive to the US Pacific policy.
US doubted
Some countries have expressed doubts about how far the United States would be willing to go to support them in a crisis, especially since China is one of Washington’s most important trading partners.
Others have voiced concerns that exercises like Cope North send a confrontational message that might lead to higher tensions.
Carlisle acknowledged that as a possibility.
“I think [China] has a tendency to look at things in a different light,” he said. “I think they may take this as something different than it is intended.”

Philippines,37697,manilastandard.net,2023-04-11T00:55:00Z,China ‘seals off’ Taiwan on 3rd day of military drills,"PINGTAN, China—China simulated “sealing off” Taiwan during a third day of wargames around the self-ruled island on Monday, as the United States deployed a naval destroyer into Beijing-claimed waters in a show of force.
China launched the exercises in response to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s meeting with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last week, an encounter it had warned would provoke a furious response.
After two days of exercises that included simulating targeted strikes on Taiwan and encirclement of the island, the Chinese military said the wargames also included “sealing” it off, and a state media report said dozens of planes had practiced an “aerial blockade”.
CHINESE CARRIER. This handout photo taken on April 9 and released by Japan’s Ministry of Defense on April 10 shows a fighter plane taking off from the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong in the Pacific Ocean south of Okinawa prefecture, on the third day of China’s military drills around Taiwan. AFP
One of China’s two aircraft carriers — the Shandong — also “participated in today’s exercise”, the military added.
The United States, which had repeatedly called for China to show restraint, on Monday sent the USS Milius guided-missile destroyer through contested parts of the South China Sea.
“This freedom of navigation operation upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea,” the US Navy said in a statement.
It added that the vessel had passed near the Spratly Islands — an archipelago claimed by China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei. It is about 1,300 kilometres (800 miles) from Taiwan.
The deployment of the Milius immediately triggered more anger from China, which said the vessel had “illegally intruded” into its territorial waters.
And Beijing warned Monday that Taiwan independence and cross-strait peace were “mutually exclusive”, blaming Taipei and unnamed “foreign forces” supporting it for the tensions.
“If we want to protect peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, we must firmly oppose any form of Taiwan independence separatism,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin warned.
Meanwhile, Japan said on Monday it had scrambled jets in recent days as Chinese planes landed and took off from the Shandong.
‘No war’
On Beigan island, part of Taiwan’s Matsu archipelago that is within sight of China’s mainland, 60-year-old chef Lin Ke-qiang told AFP he simply did not want war.
“We, common people, just want to live peaceful and stable lives,” Lin said, adding that Taiwan’s military was no match for China’s.
“If any war happens, now that their missiles are so advanced, there’s no way our side could resist. This side will be levelled to the ground.”
China and Taiwan split at the end of a civil war in 1949. China views democratic Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to take it one day.
The United States has been deliberately ambiguous on whether it would defend Taiwan militarily.
But for decades it has sold weapons to Taipei to help ensure its self-defense and offered political support.
Tsai met McCarthy outside Los Angeles on her way home from a visit to two allied countries in Central America.
In August last year, China deployed warships, missiles, and fighter jets around Taiwan in its largest show of force in years following a trip to the island by McCarthy’s predecessor, Nancy Pelosi.
Tsai meeting with McCarthy in the United States rather than in Taiwan, was viewed as a compromise that would underscore support for the island but avoid inflaming tensions with Beijing.
But China had repeatedly warned against any meeting and began the latest wargames soon after Tsai returned to Taiwan.
“These operations serve as a stern warning against the collusion between separatist forces seeking ‘Taiwan independence’ and external forces and against their provocative activities,” Shi Yin, a PLA spokesman, said about “Joint Sword”.
Tsai responded to the drills by pledging to work with “the US and other like-minded countries” in the face of “continued authoritarian expansionism”.
Live-fire exercises
The exercises on Monday were set to include live-fire drills off the rocky coast of China’s Fujian province, about 80 kilometres south of the Matsu islands and 190 kilometres from Taipei.
The local maritime authority said the exercises would be held between 7:00 am and 8:00 pm around Pingtan, a southeastern island that is China’s nearest point to Taiwan.
AFP journalists on Pingtan did not see any immediate military activity in an offshore area on Monday.
A video published Monday to the Chinese Eastern Theatre Command’s official WeChat account showed a pilot saying he had “arrived near the northern part of Taiwan Island”, with missiles “locked into place”.
In another video with dramatic orchestral accompaniment, an officer’s piercing whistle sends military personnel running into position as a simulated barrage on Taiwan unfolds on screen.
Japan said Monday it had scrambled jets in recent days as Chinese fighter planes landed and took off from an aircraft carrier deployed near southern Japan and Taiwan.
In a statement, Japan’s joint staff said it had observed the Shandong and several other Chinese naval vessels in the area south of Miyako island since Friday.
It listed the Kuznetsov-class Shandong, along with a Luyang III-class missile destroyer, a Jiangkai II-class frigate and a Fuyu-class fast combat support ship.
The vessels were spotted between 230 and 430 kilometres (140 and 270 miles) south of Miyako Island, in the far south of Japan, the statement said.
“We confirmed approximately 120 landings and departures on the Chinese navy’s Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier Shandong, 80 times by fighter aircraft and 40 times by helicopters,” the statement said.
Japanese forces mobilised two escort groups to surveil the Chinese vessels and “Air Self-Defense Force fighter jets scrambled in response to the landing and take-off of the fighter jets on board” the Shandong, the statement added.
Tokyo first confirmed the three vessels were moving in areas near southern Japan’s Okinawa region last Thursday.
The defense ministry said it was the first time it had confirmed the Shandong’s operation in the Pacific Ocean through first-hand surveillance.

France and the Philippines have conducted joint maneuvers in the South China Sea in a show of possible interoperability between the forces of the two distant countries.
According to the French Embassy in Manila, the French Navy frigate FS Prairial (F731) and the Philippine Coast Guard patrol vessel BRP Capones (MRRV-4404) participated in a passing exercise (PASSEX) in the highly-contested water last March 20.
The embassy said the exercise was ""an excellent way to develop inter-allied interoperability as part of France’s multilateral approach in this region."" They are conducted at the heels of China's aggression in the South China Sea—a resource-rich and busy waterway that it claims its own.
""France illustrates on this occasion its status as a coastal and sovereign nation of the Pacific, concerned with the security issues of the region,"" it added.
The Prairial is a Floréal-class frigate based in Papeete and belongs to the Armed Forces in French Polynesia, which is being commanded by Rear Admiral Geoffroy d’Andigné.
Dedicated to a wide range of missions such as sovereignty missions in the French exclusive economic zones or missions of aid to populations or cooperation, it is 94 meters long, has a crew of about 100 and carries a Dauphin helicopter.
Prairial regularly carries out missions in Asia.
In November 2022, Manila and Paris agreed to ""diversify"" their cooperation in the fields of defense and security, by sustaining their high-level interactions, education, training cooperation and various maritime-related exchanges.

Philippines,34010,manilastandard.net,2021-09-09T00:00:00Z,China sets naval drills; US praises VFA redux,"China has cordoned off an area in its southern coast to naval traffic for live-fire exercises on Thursday and Friday that would enhance its ability to seize an island, the South China Morning Post reported.
This developed as the United States is “very gratified” the Philippines has restored the Visiting Forces Agreement between the old treaty allies, US State Secretary Antony Blinken said on Friday (see related story – Editors).
Despite potentially inflaming its military friction with the United States in the South China Sea, China sealed off an area in the west of the Leizhou Peninsula, just above the Chinese island of Hainan, for the live-fire drills, its Maritime Administration said in a notice as reported by SCMP.
Chinese state media reported separately that a naval detachment under the Southern Theatre Command had conducted an amphibious landing exercise in the South China Sea in early Wednesday morning.
According to video footage released by the state broadcaster CCTV, the exercise involved using Wuzhishan – a Type 071 amphibious transport dock – and two helicopters, at least one tank and three air-cushioned landing craft.
ADVERTISEMENT
The video also showed soldiers being sent to an unspecified island by both the helicopter and the transport dock, SCMP reported.
Meanwhile, the Philippines is leaning on the US and its obligations under the VFA and the Mutual Defense Treaty to counter any potential Chinese threat in the SCS.
Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said Wednesday key areas in the MDT with the United States must be updated “to make it more current and relevant to the existing security situation.”
To that Blinken said: “We are very gratified to have the recent renewal of the Visiting Forces Agreement,” during a meeting with Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. in the US.
This was the first time Locsin and Blinken met face-to-face in time for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the MDT and 75 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations.
President Rodrigo Duterte decided to reinstate the security pact last July after a “thorough assessment (of the agreement) based on national interest.”
For Locsin, the move puts the relationship between the US and the Philippines back on track and restores the security balance in the Asia Pacific region.
Blinken also underscored the importance of freedom of navigation and respect for international law in the South China Sea and reiterated calls on China “to abide” by the 2016 arbitration ruling issued pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Aside from COVID-19 response and security alliance, the two top diplomats also discussed economic engagement and human rights while reaffirming the importance of the two nations’ bilateral relationship.
On Wednesday, Lorenzana spoke at a forum organized by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies for the 70th anniversary of the Philippines-US MDT.
He said the treaty areas needing an update include the reiteration and further clarification of the precise extent of the Washington DC’s commitments to Manila under the treaty and other issues, in accordance with the 2016 arbitral tribunal award by the Hague.
However, China continues to ramp up activities in the South China Sea, and its weekend exercises reflected the increasing posturing by the Chinese navy, which has organized a series of drills this year aimed at enhancing its ability to take over an island.
“In recent years, this [naval] detachment has organized targeted exercises in conjunction with major exercises and has accelerated the deep integration of the amphibious landing vessels with other combat forces,” the CCTV video said.
SCMP quoted Song Zhongping, a Hong Kong-based military commentator and a former PLA instructor, who said the amphibious island-seizure exercise had a strong and clear signal – to regain the island they once lost.
“China has been emphasising such exercises in recent years. The island seizure ability shown in the video reflected that the PLA has already conducted enough exercises to gain superiority in the air and at sea, and this marine combat ability will certainly be used to regain control of some islands,” Song said.
According to data compiled by the Morning Post, China has conducted 20 naval exercises involving elements of island capture in the first half of the year alone, nearly double the 13 exercises carried out during 2020.
The recent exercise came after the guided-missile destroyer USS Benfold sailed near a disputed South China Sea reef, the Mischief Reef, which China claims as its own but is also claimed by the Philippines and Vietnam.
An international tribunal ruled in 2016 that most of China’s claims in the waters had no legal basis.
The Benfold incident started a new round of jabs between China and the US after Beijing introduced a regulation in late August requiring notice by foreign vessels entering its claimed territorial waters.
In another evidence of friction between the superpowers, China kicked off a series of naval exercises in late August, just before a high-profile joint drill between the US and other members of the strategic Quad alliance off the coast of Guam.

Philippines,40508,manilastandard.net,2024-04-24T17:00:00Z,Navy ready to respond to Chinese interference vs. Balikatan exercises,"- Advertisement -
The Philippine Navy said it is prepared to implement contingency measures should China interfere in the ongoing Balikatan military exercises between Manila and Washington in the West Philippine Sea amid a significant increase in Chinese navy, coast guard and militia vessels in the area.
At least 16 Chinese maritime militia vessels were seen near Recto Bank during a resupply mission from April 20 to 22, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources said yesterday.
“There are appropriate measures in place,” said Philippine Navy spokesperson for the WPS Commodore Roy Vincent Trinidad.
He, however, declined to elaborate, citing security reasons.
Earlier, Trinidad said the number of Chinese ships in the WPS surged to 124 this week, double the usual average of 60 vessels in the past two months.
“This coincides with Balikatan. This upsurge is out of the normal,” Trinidad said.
BFAR Mission Commander James Abordo said the latest display of coordination between the Chinese maritime militia vessels and the Chinese Coast Guard prove that they are working together.
Despite the increase in Chinese vessels in the area, Trinidad said he expects Beijing to be less aggressive during the multilateral maritime exercise.
That has been the call ever since for China to respect international law and I expect them to behave this time,” he added.
A highlight of this year’s Balikatan is the sinking of BRP Lake Caliraya, the aging warship of the Philippine Navy that was chosen to be the target for the weapons capability exercise.
BRP Lake Caliraya was a Chinese made ship sold to the now defunct Philippine National Oil Company Shipping and Transport Corporation, then later transferred to the Philippine Navy for logistics purposes.
BRP Ramon Alcaraz, on the other hand, will have a joint bilateral maritime sail with France.
The location of the joint sail was yet to be disclosed as of press time.
The annual drills will be concentrated in the northern and western parts of the country, near the potential flashpoints of the South China Sea and Taiwan.
The joint drills involve a simulation of an armed recapture of an island in Palawan, the nearest major Philippine landmass to the hotly disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.
The same exercise will be held in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Batanes, both less than 300 kilometers (180 miles) from Taiwan.
The Philippine Coast Guard will join Balikatan for the first time following several confrontations between its vessels and the China Coast Guard, which patrols reefs off the Philippines’ coast.
In another first, the drills will go beyond the Philippines’ territorial waters, which extend about 22 kilometers from its coastline.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'South China Basin'], 'TTO': ['Republic of Trinidad and Tobago'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Cagayan', 'Claro M Recto', 'Province of Palawan', 'Province of Batanes'], 'USA': ['Washington', 'South China'], 'None': ['Spratly Islands']}",joint_security_force_exercise,"['Chinese', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Chinese']","['Chinese', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

Philippines,9925,manilastandard.net,2016-09-13T00:01:00Z,"PH ignores China-Russia ‘seize, control’ drill","THE Palace played down fears Monday of any territorial encroachment as China and Russia launched eight days of joint naval drills in the South China Sea that would focus on “seizing and controlling” islands and shoals. “There shouldn’t be any worries because China has said... that they are open to negotiations...and in fact, they are the ones who are pushing for this,” Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo said in a television interview. Panelo said that as long as the Chinese showed that they do not pose a threat to the security of the country, the Philippines would not react negatively to the military exercises. China’s drills come two months after an international tribunal in The Hague dismissed China’s historical claims to most of the South China Sea. China refused to take part in the arbitration and has accused the US of stoking tensions between China and its Southeast Asian neighbors. Panelo said President Rodrigo Duterte, in speaking about the territorial dispute, took a political rather than a legal view. “It’s better because in [the President’s] point of view, this is not the time to flaunt our win at the Arbitration Court, but this is the time to find common ground,” he said. A Chinese Navy spokesman, Liang Yang, said the eight-day joint exercises would focus on “seizing and controlling” islands and shoals. They will involve surface ships, submarines, fixed-wing aircraft, ship-borne helicopters, marine corps and amphibious armored equipment from both navies, he said. “Compared with previous joint drills, these exercises are deeper and more extensive in terms of organization, tasks and command,” he said in the statement, released Sunday. China claims almost all of the South China Sea and has sought to bolster its case by building a series of artificial islands capable of supporting military facilities.But a UN-backed tribunal ruled in July that any extensive claims to the sea had no legal basis and that China’s construction of artificial islands in disputed waters was illegal. Beijing reacted furiously, with foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang threatening a “decisive response” if anyone took “any provocative action against China’s security interests based on the award.” Beijing’s land reclamations have prompted criticism from other claimant countries and the US, and Washington has regularly sent warships into the strategically vital area to assert the right to freedom of navigation. This week’s drills will be carried out off the coast of Zhanjiang city in the southern province of Guangdong. Their precise location was not announced, but they do not appear to be taking place in disputed parts of the sea. They were aimed at “strengthening the capabilities of the Chinese and Russian Navies in jointly handling security threats on the sea,” navy spokesman Liang said. China and Russia have close military and diplomatic ties, often in opposition to the West, particularly the United States, and their leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin enjoy a tight relationship. Last August, the two powers held military exercises in the waters and airspace of the Peter the Great Gulf, south of the Russian Pacific city of Vladivostok, involving 22 vessels, up to 20 aircraft and more than 500 marines. In May last year, they conducted their first joint naval exercises in European waters in the Black Sea and Mediterranean, China’s farthest-ever drills from its home waters.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'Guangdong Sheng', 'South China Basin'], 'RUS': ['Russian Federation', 'Vladivostok', 'Russian Black Sea Coast'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Washington', 'Pacific City', 'Hague', 'Great Gulf'], 'GRC': ['Mediterranean']}",joint_security_force_exercise,"['China', 'Russia']",['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

Philippines,502,inquirer.net,2012-04-17T22:03:02Z,Seized Chinese vessels remind PH Navy ‘we can do it’,"PUERTO PRINCESA CITY—Odd-looking dinghies with markings of the Western Command stuck out like a sore thumb among camouflaged naval vessels lined up for the start on Monday of the military component of the annual war games between the Philippines and the United States.
The dinghies looked different because they were Chinese fishing boats seized by Philippine Navy patrols during numerous cases of Chinese incursions into Philippine territory. The boats have been commissioned into the Naval Forces West, a branch of the Philippine Navy tasked with guarding against further Chinese incursions.

“It is not always that the Chinese get away like they did in Scarborough,” said a Navy officer who asked not to be identified.
He was referring to the escape of all eight Chinese fishing boats amid a standoff in Scarborough Shoal, 230 km west of Zambales province in Luzon.
“Yes, those (Chinese) boats in our possession mean we can do it,” said Col. Neil Estrella, spokesperson of the Western Command.
Philippine and US officials were, nevertheless, careful not to spin this year’s ratcheted-up edition of the Balikatan exercises into a muscle-flexing event against China’s aggression currently on display at the Scarborough Shoal.
“We’ve been doing this (joint military exercises) every year … This is just part of a continuing mission of the US military,” said US Marine Capt. Staci Reidinger at a press briefing on Monday.
Reidinger is the Exercise Balikatan 2012-Palawan US Forces public affairs officer but he is normally assigned to the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, Arizona, as director of public affairs.
With more US troops participating in the exercise done annually for the past 28 years under the Mutual Defense Treaty and Visiting Forces Agreement, close to 1,000 personnel have built more school buildings and increased medical assistance this year than in previous years. (This is the 10th time that the exercise was held in Palawan.)
The public relations officers of both sides have exerted more effort to defuse questions on the impact of this year’s exercises on tension between the Philippines and China over their claims in the Spratlys.
“We’re not here scouting out sites (for bases). I understand this seems to be a popular speculation but we’re not hunting out sites,” Lt. Ray Ragan, a US military spokesperson, said at the outset of medical missions in impoverished Palawan communities two weeks ago.
Still, some of the objectives of the amphibious military exercises have attracted the attention of media and activists such as Pamalakaya, a fisherfolk group that had accused the United States of preparing to develop Palawan as a de facto naval base.

Philippines,13838,manilastandard.net,2017-10-06T00:01:00Z,US-PH war games up for encore,"THE Philippines’ military chief hailed the United States as his nation’s “number one ally” and announced a return of regular war games, following President Rodrigo Duterte’s call for warmer ties. Duterte last week vowed to be “friendly” with the United States, signalling an end to relentless criticism that included a vow to end all joint military exercises and branding then US President Barack Obama a “son of a bitch.” Military chief Gen. Eduardo Ano, returning from Hawaii where he met US Pacific Command chief Admiral Harry Harris last week, said Thursday the allies had agreed to increase joint military exercises for 2018 after they were scaled down this year. “The president said: ‘I want to be friendlier to the US’. So we have a closer relationship and more exercises,” Ano told reporters in Manila. “He [Duterte] said to continue engagement with the United States. They are still our number one ally.” Año said the joint exercises next year would focus on counter-terrorism, disaster response and even territorial defense. As he sought to loosen his nation’s alliance with the United States, Duterte also looked to build warmer relations with China and Russia. During a visit to Beijing a year ago he announced his nation’s “separation” from the United States.He later explained he was angry at Obama for criticizing his war on drugs, which has since seen thousands killed and led rights groups to warn Duterte may be orchestrating a crime against humanity. Duterte said last week the dispute was “water under the bridge” as he thanked the United States for helping the Philippines fight Islamic militants who have occupied parts of the southern city of Marawi since May 23. The US has provided intelligence, weapons and training to local forces trying to retake Marawi. The fighting has claimed more than 900 lives and raised fears the Islamic State group is trying to establish a Southeast Asian base in the Philippines. Año said on Thursday the Philippines would still pursue closer defense ties with China. Año was speaking at a ceremony at which China turned over 3,000 assault rifles and ammunition worth 168 million pesos ($3.2 million) to the Philippine military for use in fighting terrorism. “The US is not our enemy. China is not our enemy. Our utmost priority is the interest of the country,” Año said.",0,,,"{'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Marawi City'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Hawaii'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'RUS': ['Russian Federation']}",joint_security_force_exercise,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing']
Philippines,18111,inquirer.net,2018-10-11T05:34:52Z,US-PH war exercise worries China,"China has raised concerns about a joint US-Philippine military exercise that coincides with the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to the country in November, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said on Tuesday.
Roque said Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua raised the concern in a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte in Malacañang on Monday.
ADVERTISEMENT
Zhao called on the President to discuss Xi’s visit.
“China of course expressed concern over a naval, a military, exercise that the United States will be conducting in the area about the same time that the Chinese president will be in the Philippines,” Roque said.
He did not elaborate on what particular drill China was concerned about.
No scheduled exercise
Military officials said they were unaware of any US military exercise with Filipino forces next month.
Zhao may have been referring to the US Pacific Fleet’s reported plans to deploy planes and ships to the South China Sea to show American disapproval of China’s militarization of artificial islands it has built in the heavily disputed waterway.
Roque said the President assured Zhao that the Philippines “will not take part in that military exercise.”
“We don’t want anything to mar the visit of President Xi. I think the Department of Foreign Affairs will do all that it can to make sure that President Xi’s visit will be fruitful and as productive as we want it to be. We want a seamless visit of President Xi,” he said.
He said China had given assurance that it did not want to use military force on any state over the South China Sea disputes.
ADVERTISEMENT
A UN-backed arbitration tribunal has invalidated China’s claim to almost all of the South China Sea, but Beijing has ignored the international court’s ruling.
Besides the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan have competing claims in the South China Sea.
Repairing ties with China
After taking office in 2016, the President worked to repair relations with China, which had been damaged by the two countries’ territorial dispute in the South China Sea.
The President announced early in his presidency that he would end annual combat drills with the US military in an effort not to offend China, but the exercises continued.
China opposes US-led military exercises in the South China Sea, accusing the United States of intervening in a purely Asian dispute.
The United States has pressed on with the exercises and military patrols to promote freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea.
Joint exploration
Roque said Zhao and the President agreed that a proposed joint oil exploration in the West Philippine Sea would benefit both countries.
West Philippine Sea is the local name of waters within the Philippines’ 370-kilometer exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea.
Earlier, Malacañang said it hoped a joint exploration deal could be signed with China during Xi’s visit.
Roque said Zhao affirmed Chinese financial assistance in connection with a “page-long list of projects” in the Philippines. —With a report from AP

Philippines,1801,inquirer.net,2012-12-07T18:46:29Z,China air force in large-scale drill amid tensions,"BEIJING—China’s air force has staged one of its largest-ever drills amid heightened tensions with Japan and Beijing’s southern neighbors over territorial claims, state media reported Friday.
The air combat exercises involving more than 100 pilots were held over 11 days last month in the vast northwestern region of Xinjiang, according to the website of the Communist Party newspaper People’s Daily and other official news outlets.
ADVERTISEMENT
Pilots practiced engaging in dog fights and countering electro-magnetic interference, the reports said.
Aircraft taking part came from 14 separate units and included China’s most modern jet fighters, the J-10 and J-11, along with older models and two-seater Sukhoi Su-30s purchased from Russia, the reports said.
The exercises are a vivid demonstration of China’s vastly improved military capabilities that have unnerved other Asian nations and spur a renewed US focus on the region. The Global Times newspaper published by People’s Daily called them the largest in recent years in both firepower and numbers of aircraft, and said they also involved large numbers of technicians and experts on missiles, radar and other related technologies.
They came amid stepped-up sea patrols around East China Sea islands claimed by China but controlled by Japan that followed an explosion of violent anti-Japanese protests across China in September.
Beijing has dispatched China Marine Surveillance vessels almost daily to confront Japanese Coast Guard cutters around the uninhabited rocks north of Taiwan, known as the Senkakus in Japan and Diaoyu in China. Taiwan, which calls the islands Diaoyutai, also claims them.
The drills also follow renewed feuding between China and other claimants to islands and maritime territory in the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea). Aggressive patrolling by Chinese vessels has prompted Vietnam and the Philippines to bolster their forces with additional ships, planes, and submarines, and has drawn in the US, which insists on free navigation through the region of crucial shipping lanes and rich fishing stocks and undersea mineral wealth.
While the exercises were being held, China’s navy also for the first time launched and recovered aircraft from the country’s first aircraft carrier, a refurbished Ukrainian craft that will be armed with J-15 fighter-bombers, a Chinese adaptation of the Russian Sukhoi Su-33.

Philippines,10532,manilatimes.net,2016-10-06T19:35:03Z,Indonesia holds military drill at South China Sea,"It is aimed at making preparations to “face challenges”
JAKARTA: The Indonesian air force Thursday held a major exercise around its islands in the South China Sea where there have been clashes with Chinese vessels in waters claimed by Beijing.
Thousands of personnel as well as F-16, Sukhoi and Hercules planes took part in the drill around the remote Natuna islands in the far northwest of the archipelago, with President Joko Widodo in attendance.
Military spokesman Tatang Sulaiman said the exercise was aimed at making preparations in case of potential threats and to “face challenges”.
“We are conducting this exercise so that if there is an operation in this area, we know what to do,” he said.
Chinese fishing and coastguard vessels have been embroiled in repeated confrontations with Indonesian patrol boats and navy ships in waters around the Natunas this year, sharply raising tensions between Jakarta and Beijing.
Indonesia is bolstering its defenses around the Natunas — a remote scattering of islands, home to rich fishing grounds — and plans to deploy extra warships, fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles.
Unlike some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, Jakarta has long maintained it has no maritime disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea and does not contest ownership of reefs or islets there.
But Beijing’s expansive claims in the sea overlap Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone — waters where a state has the right to exploit resources — around the Natunas.
China has defended its incursions into Indonesian waters around the islands, saying its trawlers are operating in “traditional Chinese fishing grounds”. But Jakarta disputes this.
Widodo flew to the Natunas early Thursday to watch the air force drill, inspect weapons systems and observe the development of the fishing industry, his second visit to the islands in recent months.
In June he toured the islands on a warship to send a strong message to China to respect Indonesian sovereignty.
Beijing asserts sovereignty over almost the entire, resource-rich South China Sea.
In July a UN-backed tribunal in The Hague ruled against China’s claims, finding in favor of a challenge from the Philippines which has long-running territorial disputes with Beijing in the waters.

Amid the twin threat of China’s continuing aggression over territorial disputes in the South China Sea and North Korea’s war posturing against South Korea and the United States, the Philippines will host the 2013 Balikatan, a joint military exercise with US troops on April 5-17 in Luzon. A combined 8,000 Filipino and American soldiers, a flotilla of modern warships, plus 20 additional US aircrafts would take part in the annual exercises, which are being held based on a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty between the two countries. Military spokesman Col. Arnulfo Marcelo Burgos said 14 of the 20 US aircrafts arrived at the Clark Air Base in Pampanga on Monday, while the remaining six would start arriving today until April 8. Burgos, however, did not say what type of aircraft the US military deployed in the country for the exercises. He said the air assets will support the joint humanitarian and disaster training in Central Luzon and would provide air logistics support and services to the members of the BK13. The Armed Forces of the Philippines, meanwhile, would deploy 20 aircrafts and three Navy ships for the exercise. Burgos said the ships consist of two vessels and an Islander. The Air Force recently acquired eight Poland-made Sokol helicopters while the Navy has the four-decade old, high-endurance cutter BRP Gregorio del Pilar, formerly a Hamilton-class from the US Coast Guard. On Wednesday, the USS Tortuga docked in Manila to participate in the naval exercises off Zambales where the Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal is located. The area remained under territorial dispute between the Philippines and China. Manila and Beijing are also locked in a territorial dispute over the Spratly Islands within the West Philippine Sea. Other countries which claim parts of Spratly are Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia. The Kalayaan Island Group town in Palawan, which is composed of nine islets and two reefs, is located at the heart of Spratly, one of three major islands in the South China Sea. The KIG is governed by a local government unit headed by Mayor Eugenio Bito-onon. Burgos said a number of military and public officials from Australia, Brunei, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Thailand were also invited to participate in the humanitarian and disaster roundtable discussion in Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City during the week-long exercises. “BK13 seeks to address previous disaster situations that occurred recently in the Philippines with the objectives of supporting the Government with the development of regional disaster management and emergency response mechanisms. It is also aimed at testing and validating the PH-US Military Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Response Concept of Operations in a multinational and multi-organizational exercise,” Burgos said. There are presently 200 Filipino and American personnel who are conducting Engineering Civic Action Program projects which are being held for the benefit of at least eight communities in Zambales.

Philippines,25541,mb.com.ph,2020-02-13T00:00:00Z,Taiwan mulls countermeasures if PH doesn’t lift entry ban – Manila Bulletin,"By Reuters
TAIPEI (Reuters) – Taiwan is considering countermeasures if the Philippines does not lift a ban on Taiwanese citizens visiting the country over fears about the coronavirus, the island’s foreign ministry said on Thursday.
The Philippines, more than 115,000 of whose nationals work in Taiwan in factories and as domestic helpers, said this week it had included Taiwan as part of a ban on people from China visiting the country.
Taiwan is governed entirely separately from China, but Beijing claims the island as its own and the World Health Organization (WHO) clubs its virus cases in the category for China, which has led some countries to impose the same restrictions on Taiwanese as on Chinese citizens.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou told reporters in Taipei that Taiwan had a planned response if the Philippines maintained its ban, but she declined to elaborate, saying a decision was awaited from the Philippines government.
Ou said “we will continue to communicate with the Philippines and explain that this is a one-sided and wrong decision by the Philippines’ health ministry, which has already affected the relationship between the two countries of Taiwan and the Philippines.”
Taiwan and the Philippines have close economic and cultural ties, but no formal diplomatic relations, as the Philippines, like most countries, only recognizes the government in Beijing, and not in Taipei.
Taiwan has repeatedly complained that with its 18 virus cases compared with some 60,000 in China means it is unfair for the WHO to lump them together with China and mislead other countries into believing Taiwan faces an equally dire epidemic.",0,,,"{'TWN': ['Taiwan', 'Taipei'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing']}",diplomatic_sanction,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,23526,inquirer.net,2020-01-13T04:55:59Z,Return tickets now required for visiting Chinese,"MANILA, Philippines — Chinese tourists will now be required to present return tickets and hotel reservations for every place they plan to visit in the Philippines before they are issued tourist “visas upon arrival.”
The Department of Justice (DOJ) also announced that the visas issued upon arrival to Chinese visitors would no longer be extended beyond the maximum 30 day stays.
ADVERTISEMENT
In addition, the special visa, given only to Chinese nationals, can no longer be converted to work or resident visa.
These new rules contained in a DOJ circular will take effect immediately upon publication expected this week, according to Justice Undersecretary Markk Perete.
He said the restrictions to the visa-upon-arrival privilege would ensure that Chinese tourists would not overstay.
“We want to make sure that the visa-upon-arrival facility will not be abused,”Perete said on Sunday.
‘Restrictive’
“We just put in more restrictions because of the complaints that many are using that facility to obtain employment in the Philippines,”he added.
In 2017, then Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II authorized the scheme to issue visas to Chinese visitors upon arrival at the airport without any other requirements.
Currently, the visa-upon-arrival scheme allows Chinese to stay for 30 days. The visa holder can also apply for an extension of up to six months and conversion to another form of visa for employment.
The new DOJ rules, however, prohibit the conversion of the visa upon arrival into a work visa or a resident visa.
“The new amendment makes it restrictive in the sense that if you’re coming in as a tourist, to be able to get a visa upon arrival you’re now required to provide the tickets to go out of the Philippines and to make sure no one will overstay,” Perete said.

Accredited tour operator
“If they’re coming in as tourists, they must have accommodations for every stop in their itinerary. The tour operator must of course be accredited and must provide all the details where they will be staying,”he added.
Late last year, the government reviewed the visa-upon-arrival policy after National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr. expressed alarm over the influx of hundreds of thousands of Chinese, many of whom are believed working illegally in Chinese-run online gambling offices called Philippine offshore gaming operators.
Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. also opposed the visa-upon-arrival facility, insisting that all visas should be issued by Philippine consular offices to properly vet foreign visitors.
In the wake of President Rodrigo Duterte’s pivot to China, the number of Chinese tourists who visit the Philippines has grown remarkably since 2016, data from the Department of Tourism showed.
In 2017, some 968,447 tourists from China arrived in the country, up by 43 percent from the previous year. In 2018, Chinese visitors breached the 1-million mark, reaching 1.26 million, or 17.55 percent of the total number of tourist arrivals.
China has become the country’s top tourist market after South Korea.

Philippines,29391,mb.com.ph,2020-11-29T10:56:11Z,Sen Hontiveros urges BI to terminate visa upon arrival scheme for Chinese nationals – Manila Bulletin,"Senator Risa Hontiveros on Sunday urged the Bureau of Immigration (BI) to immediately terminate the Visa Upon Arrival (VUA) scheme for Chinese nationals to stop the persistent Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGO)-related crimes happening in the country.Hontiveros reiterated her call after the Philippine National Police (PNP) reported that the VUA boosted kidnappings related to Chinese casino players and workers of the industry.<br/> <br/>“Walang tigil ang krimen na dinadala ng POGO sa bansa. Napatotohanan na natin sa Senado na maraming Chinese POGO workers ang customers ng mga prostituted and trafficked women, at ngayon, kinukumpirma na ng PNP na POGO-related din ang mga kaso ng kidnapping (POGO-related crimes in the country persists. We validated this in the Senate that many Chinese POGO workers are customers of prostituted and trafficked women and now this was confirmed by the PNP that all kidnappings are related to POGO),” Hontiveros said.<br/> <br/>The PNP-Anti-Kidnapping Group’s (PNP-AKG) report showed that there are 24 incidents in 2017 and 2018, 35 in 2019, and two in 2020. Out of these incidents, PNP-AKG said that it has arrested 34 suspects of POGO-related kidnapping last year, and 31 this year.<br/> <br/>In contrast, PNP’s data also showed that there was no casino-related kidnapping in 2016, a year before the VUA system started.<br/> <br/>It was in 2017, when the BI began the VUA scheme after former Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II issued Department Order No. 41, which allowed Chinese citizens to enter the Philippines without having previously obtained a visa from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).<br/> <br/>“The VUA scheme is a dubious project. Our investigations already revealed that corrupt BI officials involved in the pastillas scam have also profited from the VUA system,” said Hontiveros.<br/> <br/>“Nakabulsa sila ng halos P2-bilyong kickback. Kahit anong bali-baliktad natin sa VUA, klaro na puro perwisyo lang ang dala nito sa ating bansa, (they were able to pocket P2-billion worth of kickbacks. However we see it, it is clear that this VUA was detrimental to our country),” Hontiveros said.<br/> <br/>At the same time, Hontiveros said she is concerned that amid optimistic reports of COVID-19 vaccine trials, the country’s borders may again fully be open to foreign nationals.<br/> <br/>“It will be safer for everyone, Chinese and Filipinos, if all Chinese visitors entering the country apply for visas through channels monitored by the DFA,” she said.<br/> <br/>“Suspended pa lang ang VUA ngayon dahil sa COVID-19, pero dapat na itong i-terminate (The VUA was suspended only due to COVID-19 but it hasn’t been terminated).

Philippines,3186,inquirer.net,2013-11-29T14:35:42Z,"Chinese, Korean deported; more aliens eyed","DAVAO CITY, Philippines—A Chinese national allegedly involved in illegal mining in Pantukan, Compostela Valley, and an overstaying South Korean have been deported by the Bureau of Immigration office in Southern Mindanao.
Eddie Delima, Immigration control officer, said Chinese Gan Suixin violated the conditions of his tourist visa when he engaged in illegal extraction of minerals, while Korean Jin Sub Roh had been staying in the country beyond what the law allowed.

Delima said two more foreigners—German Ferdinand Szobotka and Korean Kyong Su An –were to be deported next month following their arrest for overstaying.
He said the immigration bureau was also closely watching other foreigners who may be in the country in violation of immigration laws. These foreigner included Chinese, Indians, Koreans, Pakistanis, and Sri Lankans, Delima said.
“They are in a considerable number but we can’t just arrest and deport them without a mission order,” he said, adding that most overstaying aliens, who entered the country on tourist visas, have since engaged in various businesses.

Philippines,31812,manilastandard.net,2021-04-14T01:20:00Z,DFA confronts China envoy,"The Department of Foreign Affairs on Monday summoned China’s Ambassador to Manila Huang Xilian to protest the presence of Chinese vessels at the Julian Felipe (Whitsun) Reef in the West Philippine Sea.



AERIAL SHOT. This photo from the military’s Area Task Force West released Tuesday shows Subi Reef in the Spratly Islands replete with man-made buildings and a landing strip for airplanes built by Chinese militia.



Acting Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Elizabeth Buensuceso called Huang to the DFA to shed light on the presence of 220 Chinese vessels believed to be manned by Chinese militia at the Philippine reef since early March.

While the number of ships has dwindled over the past weeks, at least nine vessels have remained, the DFA said.

“The DFA expressed displeasure over the lingering presence of Chinese vessels in the Julian Felipe Reef. The continuing presence of Chinese vessels around the reef is a source of regional tension,” the DFA said, in a statement.

During the meeting, Buensuceso asserted to Huang that the Julian Felipe Reef is within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea or UNCLOS.

Buensuceso told Huang that the 2016 arbitral award by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which ruled in favor of the Philippines, had already invalidated China’s excessive and historical claim over nearly the entire South China Sea.

“The 12 July 2016 Award in the South China Sea Arbitration ruled that claims to historic rights, or other sovereign rights or jurisdiction that exceed the geographic and substantive limits of maritime entitlements under UNCLOS, are without lawful effect,” Buensuceso said.

China, a signatory to the UNCLOS along with the Philippines, rejected the PCA ruling.

Aside from China and Philippines, other claimants over the disputed waters -- Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan — also have territorial claims over the South China Sea which analysts say could be Asia’s next potential flashpoint for a major armed conflict.

In March, the Philippines filed diplomatic protest against China over the swarming of Chinese militia vessels at Julian Felipe Reef and demanded the immediate pullout of the ships from the reef, which is located 175 nautical miles of Bataraza, Palawan and clearly within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. earlier vowed to file daily diplomatic protests against China until all their ships leave the reef.

Despite repeated calls and protests from the Philippines, Chinese ships continue to linger in the area and have even been spotted in other parts of the Kalayaan Island Group in the municipality of Kalayaan, Palawan off the country’s northwestern waters.

Buensuceso reminded the Chinese side of “proper decorum and manners in the conduct of their duties as guests of the Philippines” after its embassy spokesperson openly maligned Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana for demanding the immediate withdrawal of China’s ships in the reef.

Although both sides affirmed the peaceful settlement of disputes in addressing the South China Sea issue, Buensuceso emphasized the Philippine government’s demand for the immediate withdrawal of all Chinese vessels from the reef and other maritime zones of the Philippines, the DFA said.

Former Foreign Affairs secretary Albert del Rosario on Tuesday supported the summoning of the Chinese ambassador.

“In doing so, the DFA has acted consistent with our collective constitutional duty to protect our “national sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interest, and the right to self-determination,” said Del Rosario, chairman of policy think tank Stratbase ADR Institute.

“This is truly the ‘independent foreign policy’ contemplated by our Constitution, which is to protect our national heritage in the West Philippine Sea,” he added.

The former DFA chief said that as long as Chinese vessels remain in Julian Felipe Reef, which is part of the Philippines’ EEZ, those vessels are violating Philippine laws, which make it unlawful for any foreign person, corporation or entity to fish or operate any fishing vessel in Philippine waters.

“The lingering Chinese presence in Julian Felipe Reef is an open and continuing violation of our laws. It is but right that our leaders do whatever is necessary to address this open and continuing insult to Filipinos,” the former Foreign Affairs secretary said.

Getting the international community involved in the dispute over the South China Sea is the only way to stop China from increasing its aggressive moves in the West Philippine Sea, an expert said on Tuesday.

In a forum organized by the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines, S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies’ research fellow Dr. Collin Koh said the Philippine should welcome international involvement in the issue.

“China's greatest fear is to internationalize the South China Sea dispute. It’s the only way to prevent China from going beyond what it’s currently doing,” Koh said.

 
 Koh also recommended the Philippine government to have a “coherent” position on the issue and match it with ground actions such as more maritime patrols over the disputed area.

Carl Thayer of the University of New South Wales Canberra at the Australian Defense Force Academy said the United States will invigorate and modernize its alliances to hold China to account.

For Thayer, the presence of Chinese maritime militia and fishing vessels in Whitsun Reef or Julian Felipe Reef aims to pressure the Philippine government to cut its alliance with the US.

“The present of China's maritime militia and fishing vessels in Whitsun reef, in my opinion, is designed to put pressure on [Philippine President Rodrigo] Duterte who equivocates on whether or not he’s going to terminate the VFA (Visiting Forces Agreement),” he said.

Senator Risa Hontiveros, for her part, encouraged unity among ASEAN countries and partnership with the Quad, a strategic dialogue including the United States, Japan, Australia and India, to address the issue.

“Our government must rethink its current alliances – and perhaps its allegiances. We must be consistent and firm in standing up for our national interests,” she said in the same forum.

“We cannot allow ourselves to be kicked out of our own backyard. The West Philippine Sea is part of the patrimony of the Filipino people,” she added.

Meanwhile, the Philppine Navy said there will be no at-sea events in this year's iteration of the ""Balikatan"" military exercises between American and Filipino military forces.

The exercises started Monday and will end on April 23.

Last year's exercises were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Philippine Navy (PN) chief Vice Admiral Giovanni Carlo Bacordo said on Tuesday that the crew members of the BRP Jose Rizal and BRP Antonio Luna are undergoing various training and systems testing before their deployment.

""Our two frigates, FF-150 and FF-151 are conducting manufacturer's training and systems testing in preparation for their operational deployments,"" he added.

Both BRP Jose Rizal and the BRP Antonio Luna are capable of surface, sub-surface, air, and electronic warfare using state-of-the-art electronic sensors, long-range missiles, acoustic guided torpedoes, and an embarked anti-submarine helicopter.

BRP Jose Rizal formally joined the PN in July 2020 while BRP Antonio Luna was commissioned in March this year.

In other developments:

• The Defense Department said it discussed the developments in the West Philippine Sea with its Malaysian counterpart, with both sides reaffirming their commitment to defense cooperation. In a statement Tuesday, the department said it and the Malaysian Ministry of Defense will uphold the implementation of their 1994 memorandum of understanding.

• The Area Task Force West under the National Task Force for West Philippine Sea (NTF-WPS) said it has intensified operations in the West Philippine Sea amid the presence of Chinese vessels in the area.

In a statement on Monday, the Area Task Force West said “sea assets shall be continuously deployed to different areas in the WPS to conduct maritime and sovereignty patrols, and other law enforcement activities.” These operations will cover the Julian Felipe Reef, Pag-asa Cay, Recto Bank, and other parts of the Kalayaan Island Group (KIG).

• Senator Risa Hontiveros on Tuesday expressed her indignation against China’s increasingly aggressive territorial expansion in the West Philippine Sea, after learning that there are still 28 Chinese vessels at the Julian Felipe Reef. “We demanded that every single Chinese vessel leaves Philippine territory. Why are they still there? China is becoming the region’s biggest bully,"" she said. She added that China exploited a global health crisis by executing a series of coordinated incursions into the WPS.

• Deputy Minority leader and Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Isagani Zarate on Tuesday raised concern over the ongoing Balikatan exercises between United States and Philippine armed forces, saying they would only heighten the tension between the US and China, putting the Philippines in the middle of two competing superpowers. “It would be best for the Philippine government to assert its sovereignty on the West Philippine Sea (WPS) without playing one superpower against the other,"" Zarate said in a statement.",1,,,"{'None': ['Asia', 'Spratly Islands'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Kalayaan', 'Pag-asa', 'Bataraza', 'Province of Palawan'], 'BRN': ['Brunei Darussalam'], 'MYS': ['Malaysia'], 'VNM': ['Socialist Republic of Vietnam', 'South China Sea'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'JPN': ['Japan'], 'AUS': ['Commonwealth of Australia'], 'IND': ['Republic of India']}",diplomatic_sanction,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Philippines,37212,manilatimes.net,2023-02-15T00:38:00Z,Marcos summons Chinese envoy,"(UPDATE) PRESIDENT Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Tuesday summoned Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian over the latest aggressive acts of the Chinese Coast Guard at Ayungin Shoal in the West Philippine Sea.
Presidential Secretary Cheloy Garafil said the President expressed his serious concern over ""the increasing frequency and intensity of actions"" by China against the Philippine Coast Guard and the Filipino fishermen.
""The President summoned Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian this afternoon to express his serious concern over the increasing frequency and intensity of actions by China against the Philippine Coast Guard and our Filipino fishermen in their bancas, the latest of which was the deployment of a military grade laser against our Coast Guard vessels,"" Garafil said.
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Tuesday protested the ""aggressive"" action of the CCG when it used a military-grade laser against a Philippine ship that was on a resupply mission. In a statement, the DFA denounced the recent ""dangerous maneuvers"" of the CCG against the BRP Malapascua.
DFA spokesman Ma. Teresita Daza said Manila has filed eight notes verbale (NVs) in 2023 before the local Chinese Embassy.

""This latest number includes today's protest,"" Daza said, adding that it was the 75th NV against China filed under the Marcos administration.
The DFA filed 195 notes verbale in 2022.
""The diplomatic protest, released to the Chinese Embassy in Manila on Tuesday, condemned the shadowing, harassment, dangerous maneuvers, directing of military-grade laser and illegal radio challenges by CCG vessel 5205 against PCG vessel BRP Malapascua on February 6,"" it said.
The DFA asserted that the actions of CCG 5205 against the PCG vessel ""constituted a threat to Philippine sovereignty and security as a State, and are infringements of its sovereign rights and jurisdiction over its exclusive economic zone.""
""The Philippines has the prerogative to conduct legitimate activities within its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf,"" Daza said.
""China does not have law enforcement rights or powers in and around Ayungin Shoal or any part of the Philippine EEZ (exclusive economic zone),"" she added.
Daza said, ""These acts of aggression by China are disturbing and disappointing as [they] closely [followed] the state visit to China of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in early January during which he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to manage maritime differences through diplomacy and dialogue, without resorting to force and intimidation.""
She pointed out that the BRP Malapascua was undertaking a regular rotation and resupply mission for the BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal, the Philippines' permanent presence on the feature, when it was harassed by the CCG.
Daza said CCG 5205 ""interfered with the PCG mission, directing a military-grade laser that caused temporary blindness to Filipino crew members aboard BRP Malapascua.""
The Chinese vessel then ""undertook dangerous maneuvers by approaching at a close distance from BRP Malapascua, risking a collision that endangered the Philippine crew,"" she added.
The Chinese vessel also ""issued illegal radio challenges that demanded that the Philippine vessel leave the area,"" Daza said.
""We call on China to comply with its obligations under international law, including the 1982 Unclos (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) and the 2016 Award in the South China Sea Arbitration and direct its vessels to cease and desist from [their] aggressive activities against Philippine vessels,"" she added.
The Philippine military in 1999 ran the BRP Sierra Madre aground in the Ayungin Shoal, some 196 kilometers from Palawan, in response to China's illegal occupation of Mischief Reef.
The BRP Sierra Madre, a commissioned Philippine Navy vessel, has hosted a small contingent of military personnel to assert Manila's claim to the disputed waters.
Sen. Juan Edgardo ""Sonny"" Angara said he hopes that the Chinese ""would not resort to these tactics since these are not the acts of a 'friend.'""
""There is no threat posed by our troops as they are just delivering food and supplies to our officers there,"" he said in a text message when asked about the CCG's recent bullying of a PCG vessel.
""Diplomatic channels must be exhausted to resolve these issues to ensure there is no escalation in the future,"" Angara added.
The incident on Feb. 6, 2023, at Ayungin Shoal was not the first time that a Chinese vessel used a military-grade laser to drive away a PCG ship.
Commodore Jay Tarriela, PCG adviser of the commandant for maritime security, said the first one happened near Panata Island (Lankiam Cay) in the Kalayaan Island Group (Spratly Islands).
Tarriela said a People's Liberation Army navy ship also flashed a laser at a PCG tugboat in June 2022 for 20 minutes.
""The first time we experienced the laser-pointing of CCG was in June last year. BRP Habagat, a PCG tugboat, was then helping in the conduct of a RoRe [rotation and resupply] mission,"" he told a Laging Handa press briefing on Tuesday, February 14.
Tarriela said the difference between the two is that the first incident used blue light while in the second, a green laser was used.
""Our personnel also experienced temporary blindness and skin itchiness at the time,"" he added.
Despite the two incidents, the PCG will still patrol the West Philippine Sea to assert the country's sovereign rights in the area.
""It is important for us to underline this, the PCG did not back out from this laser-pointing incident,"" he said.
""If in case this is repeated, the PCG will have this commitment that we will still be patrolling our waters in the West Philippine Sea regardless of this danger,"" Tarriela added.
He said the PCG also considers Chinese militia ships in the West Philippine Sea as a significant concern aside from the aggressive behaviors of the Chinese Coast Guard such as ""shadowing and dangerous maneuvers"" there.
""They gather their maritime militia and they go by almost hundreds to swarm, even more than 150,"" Tarriela stated.
To counter this, the PCG has boosted the presence of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in areas occupied by the military in the SCS.
""For the PCG, we also deploy our personnel to the territories that were previously occupied only by our Armed Forces,"" Tarriela said.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'South China Basin'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Province of Palawan'], 'None': ['Philippine Basin', 'Lankiam Cay', 'Spratly Islands']}",diplomatic_sanction,['Chinese'],['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

DepEd to give teachers P5K cash allowance within first week of classesChinese authorities have so far been silent about the case, reportedly linked to an anti-corruption drive championed by President Xi Jinping since he came to power.Asked about the trial Monday, a foreign ministry official said they were “not aware of the situation.”Xiao’s alleged abduction came at a time when mainland Chinese agents were not permitted to operate in Hong Kong, and it sparked fear in the city about residents being forcibly disappeared.These fears were at the heart of massive pro-democracy protests that shook Hong Kong in 2019, prompted by a government bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China’s opaque, Communist Party-controlled judicial system.Xiao’s disappearance also followed the alleged kidnapping into mainland custody of five people working for a bookstore that published salacious titles about China’s leaders.The booksellers later appeared on mainland Chinese TV admitting to a variety of crimes.In response to the 2019 protests, China imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020.That law allowed its security agencies to operate in the city and toppled the legal firewall between the mainland and Hong Kong courts.Subscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70+ titles, share up to 5 gadgets, listen to the news, download as early as 4am & share articles on social media.

The firm violated the Consumer Act and the Food and Drugs Administration Act, Domagoso said. In a letter to Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente, Domagoso asked for deportation proceedings against the company’s incorporators, Shi Zhong Xing and Li Li. “Their utter disrespect to the country as shown by the violations of EFBPI should not be countenanced,” Domagoso said. “We cannot let these foreign nationals insult our nation and our people,” he said. PBA Party-list Rep. Jericho Nograles earlier asked the trade department to ban the Chinese beauty product. Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque had brushed off the issue, saying: “Sa akin, kalokohan lang iyan (That’s foolishness).” “Hindi dapat pinapansin iyan dahil wala naman maniniwala na tayo ay probinsya ng Tsina (You shouldn’t pay attention to that because no one will believe that we are a province of China.),” Roque said, noting that “we are proud to be Filipinos.”The Philippine government has worked on fostering warmer ties with economic superpower China since President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office four years ago. In 2018, “Welcome to the Philippines, Province of China” banners were displayed in parts of the capital.

Philippines,33380,inquirer.net,2021-07-19T12:23:02Z,PH Coast Guard stops China navy incursion near Palawan resort town,"MANILA, Philippines—The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) recently expelled a Chinese navy ship near Marie Louise Bank, which is about 309 km off El Nido town in Palawan province.
“Chinese warship 189 vicinity waters Marie Louise Bank, this is Philippine Coast Guard MRRV 4409….You are within Philippines’ exclusive economic zone,” Cmdr. Erwin Tolentino, of PCG vessel BRP Cabra could be heard as saying in a video footage of the PCG’s radio challenge on Monday (July 19).

“Your actions will affect Philippine-Chinese relations and will be reported to concerned authorities. You are advised to leave this vicinity, over,” Tolentino was heard saying in the radio challenge.
PCG shared the footage.
The incident between BRP Cabra and Chinese navy tugboat 189 happened last July 13. The PCG used its long range acoustic device to issue a verbal challenge against the Chinese ship.
The PCG ship sailed closer and followed the Chinese ship to make sure that it would leave the Philippines’ EEZ. When they were 500 to 600 yards away from each other, the Chinese ship sent a radio message:
“Philippine Coast Guard 4409, this is Chinese Navy Warship 189. Please keep two nautical miles distance from me,” the Chinese ship was quoted as saying.

Philippines,23505,inquirer.net,2020-01-30T22:28:29Z,Pangilinan: Travelers from China should go straight to Malacañang if ban not heeded,"MANILA, Philippines — Travelers coming from China should go straight to Malacañang from the airport if the government still sees no need to impose a travel ban, Senator Francis Pangilinan said.
“Kung sa tingin ng gobyerno na ligtas ang ating mga kababayan at hindi kailangan ng travel ban sa mga galing ng China dapat mula airport derecho silang lahat sa Malakanyan,” the senator said on his Facebook account Thursday night.

Pangilinan made the remark as he called anew for the imposition of a travel ban on visitors coming from the capital city of Wuhan in Hubei province as well as in other areas in China where the novel coronavirus has spread, including Hong Kong.
“Unahin ang kapakanan at kaligtasan ng mamamayang Pilipino. Magsagawa na ng massive information drive kung paano ito maiiwasan at paano magpapagaling ang nahawahan,” the senator said in a separate statement.
“Mag-setup ng mga hotline at emergency unit na magsasagawa ng mga quarantine at iba pang mga aksyon para maiwasan ang pagkalat ng sakit,” he added.
Pangilinan further pointed out the unequal treatment for Filipino and Chinese travelers, noting that the Department of Health (DOH) said it would quarantine Filipinos returning from China.
He, meanwhile, noted that even Chinese authorities have suspended air and rail travel in the area around Wuhan and have since expanded the travel ban to 16 surrounding cities with a combined population of more than 50 million people.
Malaysia has suspended the issuance of visas for Chinese citizens from Wuhan and the areas around Hubei province to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, the senator added.

He also said that the US State Department has issued a travel advisory to “reconsider travel to China due to novel coronavirus,” while the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued warnings Level 3 (avoid all nonessential travel to China) and Level 4 (do not travel to Hubei province, China).
“Kailangan nating pangalagaan ang mga kapwa Pilipino. Hindi biro ang sakit na ito. At hindi rin biro ang magkasakit sa Pilipinas,” Pangilinan said.
President Rodrigo Duterte, earlier, said that he was not inclined to order a ban on Chinese tourists.
A day after the President’s pronouncement, the DOH confirmed the first case of novel coronavirus in the Philippines.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said this after Taiwan rejected the move of the Philippines to have Ordidor deported for her “nasty” comments on social media against the Duterte administration.

Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the rights and interests of its foreign workers are protected by the country’s laws and regulations.
“We leave that wholly to the jurisdiction of Taiwan and China. Taiwan is part of China. We respect that decisions and of course in the same way that we will enforce our laws in all foreigners while they are in our jurisdiction,” Roque said in an interview over ABS-CBN News Channel.
The Philippines honors the so-called “One China policy”, which declares Taiwan as among China’s territory under the 1975 Joint Communique between the Chinese and Philippine governments.
Manila has conflicting maritime claims with Beijing in the West Philippine Sea, where the Asian giant had transformed reefs and islands into military outposts to assert ownership of the disputed waters despite a 2016 arbitral decision invalidating its claim that was based on its mythical nine-dash line.
There have been several well-publicized reports of China’s coercive actions against Philippine fishermen, coast guard and navy over the years. However, Duterte has chosen to shelve the PCA ruling in exchange for Chinese economic perks to help fund his administration’s infrastructure projects.

Philippines,25552,mb.com.ph,2020-02-14T00:00:00Z,Gov’t to ask China to submit Macau health protocols for travel ban review – Manila Bulletin,"By Genalyn Kabiling
The Philippine government intends to ask China to submit the health protocols in Macau as part of its planned review on travel restrictions in the area.
The request will be made by an inter-agency task force (IATF) after the government lifted the travel ban on Taiwan due to supposed “sufficient measures” to prevent potential virus carriers from entering or departing Taiwan.
A resolution on the matter was issued by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases following their meeting at the Palace Friday.
“The IATF is continuously monitoring several risk indicators and protocols from other jurisdictions such as Macau with a view to modifying the current travel restrictions if considerations of public health will warrant,” the task force said in a resolution.
Under the resolution, the task force chairman will “request the Chinese government to inform the Philippines of protocols being followed by Macau, if any that prevent potential carriers of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) from entering or departing such SAR (special administrative region) and enable other jurisdictions to determine the recent travel history of any traveler exiting from Macau.”
The government recently imposed a temporary travel ban on foreign travelers from China and its special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong as a precaution against the new coronavirus threat. The travel ban was implemented last Jan. 31. Filipinos have also been prohibited from visiting China and its territories as a safety precaution for the meantime.
The government expanded the travel ban to include Taiwan last Feb. 11 but lifted the restrictions Friday after being given “reliable assurance” on Taiwan’s measures to prevent the spread of the respiratory illness.
Meantime, the government task force has agreed to form a technical working group to study and formulate recommendations on the travel restrictions to “specific classes of travelers.” The new group must submit any recommendations to the task force for approval.
“Any resolution of the IATF on travel restrictions shall be subject of regular review,” the resolution added.
The resolution was signed by Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Brigido Dulay, Interior and Local Government Assistant Secretary Francisco Cruz, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade, Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat, and Information and Communications Technology officer-in-charge Undersecretary Manuel Anthony Tan.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila'], 'MAC': ['Macau'], 'HKG': ['Hong Kong']}",diplomatic_sanction,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Philippines,25162,mb.com.ph,2020-02-03T00:00:00Z,"MCIA implements directive temporarily banning travel to and from China, SAR – Manila Bulletin","By Minerva Newman
CEBU CITY – The Mactan-Cebu International Airport (MCIA) is now implementing the directive of President Duterte temporarily banning the entry of all travelers from mainland China and its Special Administrative Regions (SAR) Hongkong and Macau as a precaution against the threat of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
China’s Hubei Province and the provincial capital of Wuhan City have been at the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.
MCIAA and GMR MEGAWIDE Cebu Airport Corporation (GMCAC), with the Bureaus of Immigration and Quarantine, are working closely to ensure that all airlines operating direct international flights into Cebu from China, Hong Kong, and Macau are made aware of the new directive for them to take the appropriate action to minimize disruption to its inbound and outbound flights.
GMCAC is coordinating with all airline operators, concerned airport community stakeholders, and even with the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), operator of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), to align with the overall enforcement of the travel ban ordered by President Duterte.
According to GMCAC the entry ban exempts Filipino citizens and permanent residents in the country but requires them to be quarantined for 14 days. In response to this situation the MCIA has already designated an isolated holding area for these passengers who can disembark.
This holding facility is closed off to nonessential airport employees and is connected to a separate bus bay to ensure proper handling and transport of the quarantined passengers, in line with the required stringent quarantine procedures, the media statement read.
GMCAC chief executive advisor Andrew Harrison said in a press conference that more than a week the Mactan-Cebu International Airport community has already put in place precautionary measures to control the potential spread and transmission of the novel coronavirus and to ensure the well-being of passengers and employees.
“We are committed to working with the relevant authorities to monitor the situation. The following measures are being implemented at MCIA accordingly:
In-flight announcements: All airlines have been advised to make a standard in-flight announcement prior to landing at MCIA advising passengers experiencing flu-like symptoms to self-declare and voluntarily submit to a medical screening by the Bureau of Quarantine upon disembarkation.
Intensified thermal scanning: The Bureau of Quarantine is on heightened alert and has intensified monitoring of arriving passengers in MCIA by taking additional thermal scans of passenger body temperatures on the aerobridges of all flights arriving directly from China. This is in addition to the thermal scanning at the Immigration Arrival Level.
Bureau of Quarantine Officer Dr. Paul Longinos said they have augmented their staff manning the counters and added three more handheld thermal scanners to speed up testing and other tasks.
Longinos said that all international and domestic passengers coming in and out of Cebu are subjective to thermal scans to ensure safe and protected travels.
Hand sanitization and air disinfection: According to Harrison Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are being installed in all aerobridges and arrival corridors with passengers being asked to use these facilities.
“Liquid disinfectant will be sprayed in the aerobridges prior to each flight arrivals, as well as ground handlers have also been given hand sanitizers,” Harrison added.
Medical team to be stationed at the arrivals area: A medical team is stationed at the arrivals area of Terminals 1 and 2 to provide information and advice to any passengers. The Bureau of Quarantine will however maintain primary responsibility for dealing with suspected cases.
According to Longinos even its medical team has also been augmented with an additional of 20 nurses and four doctors on top of the existing staff at the BOQ to deal with the current situation.
Airport front liners to wear protective masks: All airport staff dealing with passengers upon immediate arrival are required to wear surgical masks as a precautionary measure. As the virus is currently understood to be transmitted through contaminated droplets, surgical masks will provide adequate protection.
Adequate information materials and announcements: Information materials will be displayed in prominent areas at Arrival and Departure to provide the passengers with ample information on coronavirus, Harrison said.
Announcements and reminders will be made on a regular basis and running electronic messages will be displayed around the airport. These messages will be based on guidance material from the Department of Health and Bureau of Quarantine, he added.
Meanwhile in Negros Oriental, governor Roel Degamo has ordered the strict implementation of his Executive Order No. 4, Series 2020 directing the Negros Oriental Poiice Provincial Office (NOPPO in accordance with pertinent issuances to assist doctors and medical staff, both public and private, for the strict implementation of the EO.
According to the EO, any foreign national who is subjected to be placed on quarantine based on the DOH nCoV decision tool but refused to be quarantined, shall be apprehended and be sent back to their place of origin.
Degamo also directed the Integrated Provincial Hospital Office (IPHO) to strengthen the monitoring system, deepen investigation, and intensify contact tracing for those who have been in contact with the couple while they were in Dumaguete City and the Province.
The Department of Health (DOH) has recently confirmed that the 2nd confirmed case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus died Saturday. The deceased was a 44-year old man from Wuhan, China. He was the man-companion of the woman confirmed first case of nCoV in the Philippines.

Computer security firm Kaspersky Labs said in their latest cybersecurity bulletin that a Chinese-speaking hacker group called “Naikon” had successfully infiltrated governments around the South China Sea region including the Philippines.
ADVERTISEMENT
Naikon had been conducting “at least five years of high volume, high profile, geopolitical attack activity” and had a “high success rate in infiltrating national organizations in Asean countries,” Kaspersky said.
READ: Spy vs spy: Two cyberespionage groups engage in online skirmish
“In the spring of 2014, we noticed an increase in the volume of attack activity by the Naikon [group]. The attackers appeared to be Chinese-speaking and targeted mainly top-level government agencies and civil and military organizations in countries such as the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, Nepal, Thailand, Laos and China,” Kaspersky said in their security bulletin posted on securelist.com
“An attack typically starts with an email carrying an attachment that contains information of interest to the potential victim. The document may be based on information from open sources or on proprietary information stolen from other compromised systems,” Kaspersky principal security researcher Kurt Baumgartner said in the bulletin.
Once the victim opens the attachment, a spyware program is installed on the computer without the victim’s knowledge. A decoy document will open to make the victim think nothing suspicious happened.
The spyware program is capable of getting information from the victim’s computer and sending it back to the hacker.

“There are 48 commands in the module’s repertoire, which a remote operator can use to effectively control the victim computer,” Baumgartner said.
“This includes taking a complete inventory, downloading and uploading data, installing add-on modules, or working with the command line.” he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Gov’t agencies hit in ‘Country X’
Kaspersky Labs provided an example of the how deep Naikon can infiltrate a government’s computer systems using “Country X.”
“Analysis revealed that the cyberespionage campaign against Country X had been going on for many years. Computers infected with the remote control modules provided attackers with access to employees’ corporate email and internal resources and access to personal and corporate email content hosted on external services,” Baumgartner said.
“A few of these organizations were key targets and under continuous, real-time monitoring,” Baumgartner said.
• Office of the President
• Military Forces
• Office of the Cabinet Secretary
• National Security Council
• Office of the Solicitor General
• Intelligence Services
• Civil Aviation Authority
• Department of Justice
• Federal Police
• Executive/Presidential Administration and Management Staff
Kaspersky did not explicitly state which country in Southeast Asia is Country X.
State-sponsored cyberespionage
Kaspersky believes Naikon is among the many state-sponsored cyberespionage groups looking to steal information from other governments.

Their highly sophisticated hacking methods and well-organized attacks against government agencies are not something that a single hacker would be able to do, Vicente Diaz, principal security researcher of the global research and analysis team of Kaspersky Labs, said in a previous interview.
“We were initially suspicious of that [idea] because of the type of targets that they are targeting. Who could be interested in information from one ministry, or from one military organization? Obviously this kind of information could be very useful for some governments,” Diaz said.
“In the last years, this has become more or less public. A lot of governments are saying they are investing in cyberespionage, they have [hacking] tools [and] they have [hacking] teams and they are doing this all the time,” Diaz said.
West Philippine Sea maritime dispute
China is involved in a maritime dispute with neighboring countries, namely Philippines and Vietnam, over its nine-dash claim that covers nearly the entire South China Sea including parts of the Spratly Group of Islands.
Philippines has already filed an arbitration case against China in the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea. China has refused to participate in the proceedings insisting it has undisputed sovereignty in the region.
China has started reclamation projects in several reefs in the Spratly Islands off the coast of Palawan despite strong protests from the Philippine government.

A GOVERNMENT defense official said on Tuesday that China is using psychological warfare to confuse Filipinos on the issue involving the West Philippine Sea (WPS).
""We're stuck in the Chinese narrative; we tend to bite China's psywar. Remember, all of this is part of China's psywar because they wanted us fragmented as a nation,"" National Security Council Assistant Deputy Director Jonathan Malaya said.
Malaya said that the supposed agreement between China and the Philippine government for the removal of BRP Sierra Madre off Ayungin is part of China's psywar tactics.

""The less harmonious and less unified we are in this position, it plays into the game of China,"" he added, noting the recent statement of Beijing convincing the government to set aside sovereignty for potential joint development in the region could be considered part of China's ruse.
Malaya brushed aside the proposition, saying it would compromise the country's exclusive economic zone and patrimony.

""It cannot be subject to joint development; again, this is the playbook of China,"" he said, referring to a suggestion of the Deputy Chief of Mission of the Chinese Embassy in a recent Pandesal forum.
Another defense official who requested anonymity said China would contravene all Philippine efforts to attain international prominence by defending its territorial integrity and sovereign rights.
""China is doing all dirty tactics in different dimensions to pursue its mission in the South China Sea. What has been uttered by China in the WPS issue are all considered psywar and propaganda strategy,"" the official said.
Meanwhile, former Foreign secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. has been appointed a President Marcos Jr.'s special envoy to Beijing, the government said on Wednesday.
Locsin, currently the ambassador to Britain and Ireland, often used strong language while serving as foreign secretary under former president Rodrigo Duterte and once swore at China online over the presence of its vessels in the disputed South China Sea.
He once likened China to ""an ugly oaf forcing your attentions on a handsome guy who wants to be a friend.""
His expletive-laden demand prompted a rebuke from Beijing, and Locsin later apologized to his Chinese counterpart.
The Philippine Foreign Affairs department declined to comment on Locsin's surprise appointment.
The Presidential Communications said Locsin had been appointed ""Special Envoy of the President to the People's Republic of China for Special Concerns.""
No other details were provided.
Presidential Communications chief Cheloy Garafil told reporters Locsin would serve in a ""concurrent capacity,"" suggesting he would remain as ambassador.
Locsin is a prolific poster on the platform X, formerly known as Twitter, on topics ranging from Holocaust victims to his late pet cat, but has not commented publicly on his appointment.
The decision comes at a delicate time for relations between the Philippines and China, which are embroiled in another diplomatic spat over the South China Sea.
Beijing claims almost all of the waterway, through which trillions of dollars in trade pass annually, and has ignored a 2016 international court ruling that its assertion has no legal basis.
Tensions flared this month when the Philippines accused China Coast Guard vessels of blocking and firing water cannon at boats on a resupply mission.

Telecommunications tower2
Copies of written information on the issue were sent to several lawmakers in connection with the FCC decision to prohibit the Chinese state-owned telecommunication firms from operating in the US over national security concerns.
The US-FCC has announced it has ordered China Telecom to cease US operations in 60 days.
The controversy is important in the Philippines because China Telecom has a 40 percent stake in Dito Telecommunity Corp, the third telco player in the country.
Similar security concerns have been raised against Dito’s operations in the Philippines especially its establishment of cellular sites inside or near military camps.
Last month, Senator Risa Hontiveros aired serious concerns over Dito’s relations with China Telecom. She sought a security audit by the National Security Council to assess any threat to the country.
China Telecom, the largest Chinese telecommunications company, has had authorization to provide telecommunications services for nearly 20 years in the United States.
In a statement, the FCC explained it found that China Telecom “is subject to exploitation, influence, and control by the Chinese government and is highly likely to be forced to comply with Chinese government requests without sufficient legal procedures subject to independent judicial oversight.”
The U.S. regulator argued such “ownership and control” raise “significant national security and law enforcement risks” and the operation of the division would give the Chinese authorities the ability to “access, store, disrupt” or misroute US communications, which could be used for espionage and “other harmful activities” against the nation.
The FCC explained it will issue guidance for customers of China Telecom Americas to switch to other operators.
It is the latest in a series of actions against operators the FCC considers to have links with the Chinese government, which earlier this year resulted in a ban against China Unicom among others.",1,,,"{'USA': ['United States'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",surveillance,"['China Telecom', 'China']","['China Telecom', 'China']","['China', 'China Telecom']","['China', 'Chinese']"

There is nothing to worry about any scenario of China launching attacks in the South China Sea since it has no such policy, according to Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua.
The Chinese ambassador maintained that China advocates peace and stability in the region, adding “possible attacks from the other side” should instead be the cause for concern.
“Well, we are worried about possible attacks from the other side. We don’t worry about China attacking anybody because it is not our policy,” Zhao said in an interview with reporters at the Palace.
Asked to identify the other side, the ambassador said: “Use your imagination.”
Zhao made the remarks after US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo assured that the United States will defend the Philippines in case of an armed attack in the disputed South China Sea.
Pompeo, who recently visited Manila, claimed that such US action would be triggered under its obligations in the mutual defense treaty signed with the Philippines. Manila has welcomed US public pronouncement of support in case its forces are under attack.
Zhao, however, insisted that China was more concerned about safeguarding peace, stability and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.
“Maybe you would expect the Chinese side to be very concerned about these remarks. We are concerned more, it’s about the peace and stability in the South China Sea,” he said reacting to Pompeo’s remarks.
He cautioned that every country would “suffer if peace and stability becomes something to the opposite, that it’s chaos or conflict.”

Philippines,30072,manilatimes.net,2021-01-21T00:53:26Z,‘Cyber resiliency adoption needed’,"Businesses should switch from cybersecurity to cyber resiliency to weather continued threats to their data, a cybersecurity expert said at a webinar co-hosted by Huawei Technologies Inc.In a statement, the Chinese technology company quoted Ramses Gallego, international chief technology officer at Micro Focus, as saying that adopting cyber resiliency would help companies anticipate threats, withstand and resist attacks, and recover quickly.According to him, organizations were increasingly dealing with shadow information technology, or data that is backed up on multiple clouds without the knowledge of their data-compliance departments.“Corporates need to understand the dangers in this — legal departments cannot effectively protect what they don’t know exists. Only when corporates build an ecosystem that automates and orchestrates authentication, authorization and appropriate access can we hope to create a systematic and systemic solution to the issue of data protection,” Gallego said.To address this, Gallego cited encryption and tokenization, which he said were effective risk-mitigation strategies that firms could adopt.These strategies, he added, could stand in courts tackling data-breach cases.Huawei Data Protection Director Joerg Thomas said the global community might see an increase in class action-style lawsuits on personal data this year and the next, as aggrieved parties view a judicial remedy as a faster way to get redress when their data rights were violated.Felix Wittern, a partner at Fieldfisher, said there would be more litigation cases in data privacy, especially amid the coronavirus pandemic, which slowed down enforcement efforts.Thomas said businesses needed to be transparent about the locations of personal data and the types of data being transferred.“From a long-term sustainable point of view, organizations will need to adopt data minimization and privacy by design and default, and at all times ensure that business continuity management plans are in place,” he added.",1,,,{},surveillance,['Huawei'],['Huawei'],['Huawei'],"['Huawei', 'Chinese']"
Philippines,14346,inquirer.net,2017-12-22T07:00:15Z,"With China’s entry into telco fray, PH to beef up cybersecurity","The government is beefing up national cybersecurity ahead of the expected entry of China’s biggest telecommunications company next year, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said on Thursday.
In a recent Cabinet meeting, Roque said President Duterte directed Information and Communications Technology Secretary Eliseo Rio Jr. to protect the country’s cybersecurity.

“Well, they shouldn’t worry because government is already worried,” Roque told reporters after senators expressed concern the entry of state-owned China Telecom would later pose a cybersecurity threat.
Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon and Senators Panfilo Lacson and Leila de Lima urged the Palace to be wary of China Telecom, citing security concerns.
“We need competition but we should be conscious that we should make sure that our national security is addressed carefully,” Drilon said.
Drilon said the entry of a Chinese company into the telecom industry was a “welcome development” but he asked the need to “exercise caution and (for) the government (to) look into the security aspect of this undertaking.”
“The Chinese companies are state-owned while those operating in the Philippines are purely private. The Chinese government is already an investor in our national grid. The government should look into this matter,” Drilon said.
But regulators have been ordered to take all measures to protect the country’s cybersecurity, Roque added.
“In the last Cabinet meeting, Secretary Rio reported on the steps taken on the third telco [and] the marching order really is to ensure the country’s cybersecurity,” Roque said.
Rio had promised “absolute transparency” in the process, Roque said.
Moreover, Roque said the Chinese firm would be legally required to partner with a local telco that already had an existing legislative franchise from Congress.

“I think, the fact that they’re only entitled to minority shares would mean they would have to partner with a Philippine corporation with an existing franchise,” he said.
Last month, Philippine Telegraph & Telephone Corp., recently acquired by a group led by businessmen Lucio Tan Jr., Salvador Zamora II and Benjamin Bitanga, said it was talking with China Telecom, China Mobile Ltd. and other Chinese companies.
But China Telecom said it still had no concrete plan to invest in the Philippines although it was conducting a preliminary study.
The Duterte administration has been trying to warm up relations with China and has set aside a territorial spat in the South China Sea to tap Beijing for loans, investments, expertise and trade.
Duterte last month offered Beijing a chance to challenge the dominant carriers Smart-PLDT Inc. and Globe Telecom Inc. to boost the service quality of current players.
He wants a third telecoms player to start operations in the first quarter next year, to break the duopoly and boost competition.
Beijing has chosen China Telecom, which needs to partner with a Philippine company because of a 40-percent cap on foreign ownership of domestic telecoms firms.
PLDT and Globe declined to comment on Thursday but PLDT announced it had allotted a record sum of at least P50 billion for capital expenses next year as it prepared to take on a competitor.

Philippines,17056,inquirer.net,2018-07-06T11:14:28Z,China tests electronic warfare assets in Spratlys - report,"China is “quietly” testing its recently-deployed electronic warfare assets in its fortified bases in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, American television network CNBC reported.
ADVERTISEMENT
Citing unnamed intelligence sources, CNBC said the tests mark the first known use of the equipment since its reported deployment early this year.
These electronic warfare assets are designed to “confuse or disable communications and radar systems.”
“This is very bad news, especially because most Southeast Asian militaries already don’t possess very comprehensive IEW [Intelligence/electronic warfare] capabilities to begin with, and China’s widening this asymmetry further,” Singapore-based security analyst Collin Koh said on Twitter.
The testing of these electronic warfare assets comes after China’s reported deployment of anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles in the three of its biggest outposts in the Spratly Islands. These deployments would allow them to continue asserting their territorial claims in the disputed waterway.
While China claims their bases in the South China Sea are for non-military use, it has equipped them with runways, hangars, radars, sensor arrays, missile shelters and underground storage areas.
The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims in the South China Sea, believed to be rich in fish and oil and gas reserves. /muf

Philippines,19109,manilastandard.net,2018-12-09T00:00:00Z,Security concerns hobble intel project,"The Senate is likely to remove the funding for the P20-billion surveillance and monitoring project of the Interior department with a Chinese firm due to security concerns, Senator JV Ejercito said Friday. In defense of the DILG’s budget, Ejercito, vice chairman of the Senate’s finance committee, warned that would happen if some government agencies would fail to justify the project. “Some senators will introduce amendments. If not satisfied with documents and information submitted, [there’s a] big chance it will be taken out because of national security issues,” Ejercito said. The DILG together with China International Telecommunication Construction Corp., an affiliate of China Telecom, will implement the surveillance and monitoring project. At the request of Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto, Senate finance committee head Loren Legarda asked the National Economic and Development Authority to submit documents pertinent to the Safe Philippines project that aims to install 12,000 closed-circuit television cameras in Metro Manila and Davao City. During the budget deliberations, Recto said the contract was signed by Interior Secretary Eduardo Año and the chairman of China Telecom, a partner of Mislatel that could be the country’s third telecoms service provider. He raised an alarm over the project as, according to his sources, the equipment to be used would be provided by Huawei, which appeared to be banned in many countries due to hacking allegations. “Would there not be a security threat if we allowed China Telecom to be part of a surveillance system of the DILG and the PNP?” Recto said.“Here we are discussing the possibility of giving China Telecom third telcom status. They will be part of Safe Philippines with Huawei. They are blacklisted in many countries at least as supplier.” In a press statement Thursday, the DILG said the Safe Philippines emergency response and monitoring system was not primarily for surveillance but an integrated system to improve police response time as well as deter and reduce crime. Año said the project would level up the 911 emergency system of the DILG-PNP and be used to improve public safety, evidence collection in the event of criminal activities, incident prevention measures for disaster-related mitigation and response, and police and fire emergency response in addressing traffic and criminal incidents. He expressed confidence that under the project, crime incidents would be reduced by 15 percent and response time would be improved by 25 percent. He said that while the Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. was one of the three bidders of the project, it did not win the bid. “He said Huawei and CMEC were disqualified from the bid because they did not meet the standards and specifications of the Special Bids and Awards Committee. Only CITCC met the requirements. On Nov. 19, 2018, the DILG signed the $396.8- million contract with the winning bidder CITCC for the construction and installation of monitoring systems in Metro Manila and Davao City.",1,,,"{'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Davao', 'National Capital Region']}",surveillance,"['China Telecom', 'Huawei']","['China Telecom', 'Huawei']","['Huawei', 'China Telecom']","['Huawei', 'China', 'Chinese']"

A man earlier convicted for hacking in Hong Kong was arrested in Las Piñas City for alleged drug dealing.

When caught, Edgar Silvano Jr. also gave away signs that he was into credit card fraud, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said on Friday.
Silvano was convicted for hacking into the system of Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corp. (HSBC) in Hong Kong in 2001 but was released “on probation,” according to NBI spokesperson Ferdinand Lavin.
NBI agents found two plastic bags containing suspected methamphetamine hydrochloride or “shabu” when they raided Silvano’s condo unit on Wednesday night. They also found two improvised glass pipes inside his unit at Hanalie Building, Ohana Place Residence, Barangay Almanza Uno.
Joel Tovera, head of the NBI anti-illegal drugs division, said they applied for a search warrant following a tip that Silvano—who was described by the Soldier X hackers’ website as the “best hacker in Asia”—was dealing in shabu.
A “test-buy” from Silvano confirmed the information, said Jerome Bomediano, the division’s executive officer.
The agents obtained a warrant issued by Las Piñas Executive Judge Salvador Timbang Jr., Lavin said.
“Surprisingly, during the course of operations, Silvano also yielded in open view of the agents several credit cards not under his name,” Lavin said.
An NBI video of the arrest showed the discovery of several HSBC, Metrobank, Bank of the Philippine Islands, American Express, Banco de Oro credit cards, among others, inside Silvano’s unit.
Also found in the unit were bank books, several laptops and desktop computers as well as a card printer, a reader, and a bill counting machine, according to an NBI statement.

When questioned about the cards, Silvano said in the video: “I want to see the expiry date… I want to know how to crack it.”
“It would appear from the seized paraphernalia, instruments used in credit card fraud, that he is stealing information using a skimming device and then he would print the stolen information onto blank cards,” Lavin said.
Tovera said the NBI was checking if Silvano had also hacked into online shopping web sites to get their clients’ data.
The convict’s laptops and other gadgets are being subjected to forensic examination by the NBI cybercrime division, Lavin said.
Detained at Las Piñas City jail, Silvano was charged with violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act and the Access Devices Regulation Act. TVJ

Philippines,29986,manilastandard.net,2021-01-10T22:50:00Z,"Senators blast DICT, Dito ‘failures’","Senator Grace Poe has expressed dismay over the failure of the Department of Information and Communications Technology and the National Security Council to ensure the Philippines’ ability to fight the cybersecurity warfare already raging in other countries.

Poe also questioned the preparedness of the local Dito-China Telecom partnership to fulfill its commitment over the first five years to deliver its services and to fund its telco project.

She said Dito should have had a forecast of how much was needed to be spent before the firm applied for the franchise and agreed to the commitments as the third telco player.

“They should not have anticipated the renewal of their franchise unless they are able to produce the commitments without the additional funding,” said Poe.

“I don’t want the [Senate] committee to be a hostage of that.”

Senator Risa Hontiveros has also noted the DICT’s warning that the government will revoke the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity granted to Dito if it fails to operate in 2021.

The initial failures in complying with its committed delivery of service do not augur well for a franchise of 25 years, Hontiveros said, adding: “Besides, there are many issues with China evolving in the region for the coming years”.

A sword of Damocles appeared to hang over the Philippines’ third telco as the fears over China Telecommunications’ security risks had gained ground in the United States, the senators said.

 
 The US Federal Communications Commission has moved to stop China Telecom (Americas) Corporation’s operation in the US for security reasons.

No less than FCC head Ajit Pail said the Chinese government mandates firms like China Telecom to covertly siphon sensitive information and to intercept US communications.

China Telecom and three other telcos have also been issued a show-cause order by the FCC “demanding evidence to prove that they are not at the behest of the Chinese Government.”

Aside from the FCC, the US Departments of Defense, Commerce, Justice and State and Homeland Security have also shared concerns on the Chinese government’s control over China Telecom and three other Chinese telcos.

The same apprehension over China Telecom’s security risks, particularly in the country’s telecommunications’ industry, is being echoed by Poe and Senate Minority Floor Leader Francis Pangilinan.

“China Telecom is a Chinese company, what if the Chinese government says -- you have access there...you are mandated to turn over information to us because we have the National Intelligence Law and the counter-Espionage Law,” Pangilinan said of ChinaTel.

Pangilinan has repeatedly cited the security risk posed by the Memorandum of Agreement between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and Dito-ChinaTel allowing the setting up of communications facilities and cell towers within the military camps.",1,,,"{'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'USA': ['United States']}",surveillance,['China Telecom'],['China Telecom'],['China Telecom'],['China']
Philippines,22773,manilastandard.net,2019-11-08T00:00:00Z,US firm: Chinese hackers can steal SMS,"US-based cyber security vendor FireEye Mandiant said it discovered that APT41, one of China’s most prolific hacking groups, has developed a new malware that can compromise cellular networks by monitoring and saving SMS traffic from specific phone numbers. Named MESSAGETAP, the malware was deployed by APT41 in a telecoms network provider in support of Chinese espionage activities, it said. MESSAGETAP works by tracking SMS traffic and extracting message content that contains certain keywords of geopolitical interest. In addition to stealing messages, the malware collects source and destination phone numbers of targeted individuals – including mobile subscriber identity numbers and data from call detail record databases. “The use of MESSAGETAP and targeting of sensitive text messages and call detail records at scale is representative of the evolving nature of Chinese cyber espionage campaigns,” FireEye Mandiant said. Also known as ‘Barium’ or ‘Winnti’, APT41 is an active cyber threat group that carries out Chinese state-sponsored espionage activities as well as other financially-motivated activities since 2012. Its growing technical capabilities allow it to conduct surveillance for the Chinese government as well as run data theft or extortion campaigns for profit. The Philippines’ ongoing territorial dispute with China over the West Philippine Sea makes it a particularly vulnerable target for Chinese cyber attacks. In 2015, computer security firm Kaspersky Labs reported that a Chinese-speaking hacker group called “Naikon” had successfully infiltrated governments around the South China Sea region including that of the Philippines. Naikon had been conducting “at least five years of high volume, high profile, geopolitical attack activity” and had a “high success rate in infiltrating national organizations in Asean countries,” Kaspersky said.A year later, Finnish security firm F-Secure reported that hackers based in China targeted employees at the Philippines Department of Justice, as well as the organizers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which both US president Barack Obama and Chinese premier Xi Jinping attended. Malware designed to steal sensitive information from the Philippine government and other targets was used against high-profile organizations involved in the PH-China dispute. Cyber-security software company Symantec also announced earlier this year that a Chinese cyber-espionage group called Thrip has attacked organizations in the Philippines and other countries in the region. Thrip has focused on military organizations, satellite communications operators, maritime communications organizations, media and parts of the education sectors in Southeast Asia, according to Symantec. “The threat to organizations that operate at critical information junctures will only increase as the incentives for determined nation-state actors to obtain data that directly support key geopolitical interests remains,” FireEye Mediant researchers said.",1,,,"{'None': ['Southeast Asia'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'South China Basin', 'International Asia-Pacific Convention Center'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines']}",surveillance,"['Chinese', 'Kaspersky Lab']",['Chinese'],['Chinese'],"['China', 'Chinese']"
Philippines,37696,manilastandard.net,2023-04-11T01:00:00Z,EDCA sites ‘not for attacks’,"PBBM nixes ‘offensive actions’ from bases as Balikatan begins
The Philippines will not allow “any offensive actions” from the bases it has opened to US troops, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said Monday.
The assurance comes as the Philippines and the United States kick off their biggest Balikatan military exercise today.
More than 17,600 military personnel — 5,400 from the Armed Forces of the Philippines and 12,200 from the United States Forces — will be participating in the 38th Balikatan exercise scheduled from April 11 to 28 in various areas in Zambales, Aurora, Palawan, and Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija.
They will be joined by 111 military personnel from the Australian Defense Force, as officials from 12 countries will be observers.
Manila last week announced the locations of four more military bases it is allowing the US military to use on top of the five agreed on under the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, known as EDCA.
The deal allows US troops to rotate through and store defense equipment and supplies.
But China warned last week the expanded military deal could endanger regional peace and accused Washington of a “zero-sum mentality.”
The four additional bases include sites near the hotly disputed South China Sea and another not far from Taiwan.
Mr. Marcos said China’s reaction over the expanded military deal was “not surprising,” but assured them the Philippines is only shoring up its territorial defense.
“We will not allow our bases to be used for any offensive actions. This is only aimed at helping the Philippines whenever we need help,” Marcos told reporters.
“If no one is attacking us, they need not worry because we will not fight them.”
The pact stalled under former president Rodrigo Duterte, who favored closer ties with China.
But Mr. Marcos, who succeeded Duterte in June, has adopted a more US-friendly foreign policy, and sought to accelerate the implementation of the EDCA.
The President has insisted he will not let Beijing trample on Manila’s maritime rights.
His remarks came on the heels of China’s third day of war games around Taiwan on Monday, where it simulated “sealing off” the self-ruled island (see related story on A1 – Editors).
China launched the military exercises in response to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen last week meeting US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, an encounter it had warned would provoke a furious response.
Meanwhile, AFP spokesperson Col. Medel Aguilar said the preparations for the Balikatan exercises are made a year in advance and the troops are ready.
The exercises will include work on maritime security, amphibious operations, live-fire training, urban and aviation operations, cyber defense, counterterrorism, as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
Balikatan 2023 spokesperson Col. Michael Logico said this would be the first time the AFP and US forces would engage in live-fire drills at sea.
“It has always been an interoperability exercise to test our concepts for maritime defense, for coastal defense and maritime domain awareness,” Logico said.
The Balikatan exercise is being held amid the rising tensions over the territorial dispute between Manila and Beijing.
China warned the country that it might draw “potential conflict” after the designation of new EDCA sites in the Philippines.
The new EDCA sites will be the Naval Base Camilo Osias in Sta Ana, Cagayan; Lal-lo Airport in Lal-lo, Cagayan; Camp Melchor Dela Cruz in Gamu, Isabela; and Balabac Island in Palawan.
The five current EDCA locations are Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan, Basa Air Base in Pampanga, Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija, Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base in Cebu, and Lumbia Air Base in Cagayan de Oro City.
Mao Ning, the spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the additional EDCA sites “may draw… [the Philippines] into the whirlpool of a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait.”
Signed in 2014, EDCA grants US troops access to designated Philippine military facilities and allows them to build facilities, and position equipment, aircraft, and vessels. With AFP

The US Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector has urged the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to junk the part of the undersea cable proposal of Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN), a Chinese firm, which would connect US and Hong Kong. Formerly known as “Team Telecom,” the committee is composed of the Department of Homeland Security (DOH) and the Department of Defense (DOD) led by the Department of Justice’s National Security Division, Foreign Investment Review Section. On June 17, Team Telecom recommended the specific rejection of the US-Hong Kong undersea cable connection amid fears of a digital and technology security threat and the worsening relations between the Trump administration and China. Despite the violent protests for independence besieging Hong Kong, Team Telecom believes the embattled state would be left with no choice but to submit to China’s intelligence-gathering and surveillance orders. Cable connection from the US to other Asian regions, specifically Taiwan and the Philippines, don’t bother Team Telecom quite as much, which is why the group’s recommendation to the FCC is only for a partial denial of the undersea cable application The original vision for the system was to extend the network from the United States to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines.Team Telecom made its recommendation based on “an assessment that submarine cables are a fundamental element of global communications critical infrastructure, carrying most of the world’s internet, voice, and data traffic between continents.” The group also cited the dangers posed by the undersea cable plan that would “land directly in Chinese territory, where the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has demonstrated the intent to acquire the US person’s data to harm US national security.” To back its argument, the US team noted that the DOJ had indicted Chinese hackers for the Equifax breach in February 2020 and that China has been widely accused of stealing nearly 22 million records from the US Office of Personnel Management in 2015, among others. Team Telecom also raised the alert on the motives and loyalty of PLCN's owners, Dr. Peng Group and Pacific Light Data. It cited that under Chinese law, Dr. Peng must support PRC intelligence and security protocol. Dr. Peng’s questionable compliance with US laws when acquiring telecom assets and Pacific Light Data’s link with China Unicorn, PRC’s carrier, was also cited as subjects for scrutiny. Hong Kong strategic location in Asia Pacific was also noted by the group as it is “a hub for international communications critical infrastructure, where a growing share of US communications traffic to the Asia- Pacific must first land on Chinese territory and traverse Chinese-owned or -controlled infrastructure before ultimately reaching final destinations in other parts of Asia.”",1,,,"{'None': ['Asia'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Pacific', 'Prescott'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan', 'Asia Pacific Hotel Danshui'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'HKG': ['Hong Kong']}",surveillance,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Monday confirmed that the President had yet to name a new envoy nearly two months after he ordered the replacement of ailing Ambassador Sonia Brady.

“The President has yet to nominate an ambassador to China,” DFA spokesperson and Assistant Secretary Raul Hernandez.

Philippines,15518,mb.com.ph,2018-03-29T22:00:21Z,China-Vatican deal on bishops imminent – Manila Bulletin,"By (AFP)
Beijing – A historic agreement between the Vatican and Beijing on the appointment of bishops in China could be signed as early as this Saturday, a Chinese government-approved bishop said in a report published Thursday.
Negotiations have reached ‘’the final stages,’’ Bishop Guo Jincai, secretary-general of the Bishops Conference of the Catholic Church in China, was quoted as saying by the state-owned Global Times newspaper.
“If everything goes right, the deal could be signed as early as the end of this month,’’ said Guo, who is recognized by China’s Communist government.
Beijing and the Vatican severed diplomatic relations in 1951 and although ties have improved as China’s Catholic population grows, they have remained at odds over the appointment of bishops.
China’s roughly 12 million Catholics are divided between a government-run association, whose clergy are chosen by the atheist Communist Party, and an unofficial underground church loyal to the Vatican.
The situation is complex because the Vatican has previously accepted several bishops appointed by Beijing, officially an atheist regime.
But opponents – among them the respected Hong Kong Cardinal Joseph Zen – say the agreement risks abandoning loyal believers and amounts to a deal with the devil.
On Tuesday night, Chinese police released an underground bishop at the heart of the Beijing-Vatican negotiations after holding him for a day, sources told AFP on Wednesday.",1,,,"{'VAT': ['State of the Vatican City'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'PHL': ['Manila'], 'HKG': ['Hong Kong']}",diplomatic_recognition,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

Aquino and Truong held a bilateral meeting Sunday evening after the CEO Summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. So far, the Philippines only has two strategic partners, namely the United States and Japan. Del Rosario said the venue for the joint committee meeting has yet to be firmed up. He said the strategic partnership agreement was “mostly driven by our close ties with Vietnam.” “We actually have entered into a strong commitment to be able to bring our relations closer, and the way to do this is through some form of a comprehensive strategic partnership. We still have to craft exactly what we mean by that,” del Rosario said. “But I think there’s enough of a history in terms of our relations and the fact that we have very close ties to get us to where we want to go,” he added. The Foreign Affairs chief said an inter-agency meeting will be convened ahead of the December joint committee dialog to firm up the Philippine inputs for the roadmap.Del Rosario said both Aquino and Truong have agreed to mutually support each other’s chairmanship of APEC. The Philippines is the APEC chairman next year while Vietnam will take the helm in 2017. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung proposed the strategic partnership with Manila during his meeting with Aquino in May in Malacañang. “Both our nations are looking forward to jointly determining the prerequisites in forging a roadmap towards a strategic partnership...We face common challenges as maritime nations and as brothers in Asean. I believe continued cooperation between the Philippines and Vietnam will enable us to better protect our maritime resources,” Aquino said in May after his meeting with Nguyen. Meanwhile, prior to his dialog with Truong, Aquino met with representatives from Moody’s Investor Service and Sanofi pharmaceutical company. Moody’s CEO Raymond McDaniel Jr. praised the country’s “remarkable” economic performance that led to several credit rating upgrades. “During the courtesy call, the President mentioned the government efforts to ensure that our country remain Ebola-free. He also spoke of the targets for the Yolanda rehabilitation and the instruction to build back better in order for the country to get out of the cycle of destruction and rehabilitation,” presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda said.

Newly-designated Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian has conveyed his Christmas and New Year greetings to the Filipino people even as he vowed to pursue a “comprehensive, strategic, and cooperative relations” with Manila on the eve of the 45th year anniversary of the establishment of the Philippines-China diplomatic ties.
“The streets are full of Christmas atmosphere at this time in Manila. This is my first Christmas as Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines, and I extend my sincere greetings to the people of the Philippines. Christmas is a festival of peace and joy, and one of the most important festivals to the Filipino family, and also a wonderful moment of family reunion,” the Chinese envoy said in a statement.
Xilian observed how the Filipino nation celebrates the Christmas season “peacefully and happily,” noting there are also six million Roman Catholics and 38 million Christians in China celebrating the festival yearly, enjoying what he described as China’s “basic policy on religion.”
“Respecting and protecting freedom of religious belief is the Chinese government’s basic policy on religion. China’s Constitution and related laws fully guarantee citizens’ freedom of religious belief. The Chinese government will, as always, respect and guarantee the freedom of religious belief of citizens, and strive to build the country into a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and with a sound environment,” he said.
On the commemoration of the 45th year of diplomatic relations between Manila and Beijing in 2020, Xilian said they are planning a series of celebrations ranging from “political visits to economic cooperation, from cultural events to think tank exchanges.”
“I look forward to working closely with my Filipino friends to further promote the China-Philippine relations and bring more tangible benefits to the peoples of both countries,” he added.
Looking back on what transpired in 2019, Xilian said China-Philippines relations have been moving forward steadily as the two countries sowed their commitment to “peaceful and friendly coexistence.”
“More importantly, in the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, both sides have been striving to constructively manage and address the differences,” the Chinese diplomat said in an apparent reference to the South China Sea dispute.

“We will cut off diplomatic relations ‘yan ang unang ginagawa kapag mayroong mga aggressive acts,” Panelo said.

The Philippines recently put its diplomatic relations with Canada in peril over the latter’s delay in taking back their garbage it illegally shipped to the country six years ago.
President Duterte even threatened to declare war if Canada failed to retake its trash which has been festering in Philippine ports.

Notwithstanding the controversies reported by the media against Chinese citizens in the country, Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano’s confidence for stronger friendly relationships between the Philippines and China remained strong and optimistic.
Cayetano underscored the good relations between the country as he received Wang Ning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Beijing Municipal Committee, in a courtesy call on Friday at the House of Representatives.
“We hope to strengthen the political relationship of the Philippines with the Communist Party of China and the People’s Congress,” said Cayetano as he lauded Chinese leaders for their continued support for Philippine economic progresss.
The House leader thanked China for the increasing tourist arrivals and the concessionary loans extended to the Philippines.
Many of the loan agreements financed infrastructure projects of the Duterte administration.
Responding to Cayetano’s statement, Wang stressed that their countries have a long history of friendship.
“How we address each other expresses how close our countries are,” he said.
The Chinese party official also extended his invitation to Speaker Cayetano to visit China next year which also marks the celebration of the 45th anniversary of the diplomatic ties between Philippines and China.
“We look forward to working with you. This visit will contribute to our diplomatic relations.”
With this, Cayetano proposed for the two countries to collaborate and prepare a five-year countdown plan for their 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties in 2025.
“I propose that we learn from China’s experience in planning. In 2025, we will be more than neighbors, and we can celebrate our long relationship with China,” he said.
Accompanying Wang during the courtesy call was Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian.

Cardinal Tagle said the Holy See signed the agreement ""to safeguard the valid apostolic succession and the sacramental nature of the Catholic Church in China.""
""And this can reassure, comfort, and enliven baptized Catholics in China,"" Tagle said in an interview published this week on the Vatican's official media channels.
The Vatican had announced that it had renewed its agreement with China for an additional two years on the same weekend that Chinese President Xi Jinping secured a third term as the leader of the Chinese Communist Party.
The provisional agreement between the Vatican and China was first signed in September 2018 and renewed for another two years in October 2020. The terms of the deal have not been made public.

The Vatican publicized the renewal of its agreement with China five days before Cardinal Joseph Zen, the bishop emeritus of Hong Kong, is scheduled to appear again in court. Zen was arrested in May along with other democracy activists under Hong Kong's strict national security law and has been one of the most outspoken critics of the Vatican's agreement with China.
Responding to critics of the agreement who say that the Holy See's dealings with Beijing have led to the Vatican's silence on the sufferings and problems of Chinese Catholics, Tagle said in an interview in Rome that the Holy See, in dialogue, ""has its own respectful style of communicating with representatives of the Chinese government, but which never ignores and indeed always makes present the situations of suffering of Catholic communities, which sometimes arise from inappropriate pressures and interference.""
He said that the open channel for dialogue with Chinese government authorities has been good in itself.
""Listening to the arguments and objections of the government also leads us to take into account the contexts and the 'mindset' of our interlocutors. We discover that things that are absolutely clear and almost obvious to us can be new and unknown to them,"" the former Manila archbishop said.
China's National People's Congress confirmed a constitutional change eliminating term limits granting Xi the possibility of lifelong rule in 2018, six months before the Holy See first signed its deal with Beijing.
Critics noted that under Xi's leadership, respect for human rights and religious freedom has deteriorated.

Huang expressed optimism that the bilateral relations between two countries would be further enhanced as they marked the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations next year. “The best is yet to come. 2020 is the conclusive year for China to complete building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the first centenary goal, and also marks the 45th anniversary of establishment of China-Philippines diplomatic relations.

President Duterte, China-Philippines relations have gone through a trilogy of turnaround, consolidation, and elevation in the past three years, ushering in a fresh Golden Age for the two countries,” Huang said.“Now the Philippines is China’s important partner in jointly building the Belt and Road, and China stands as the Philippines’ top trading partner, the largest source of import, the third-largest export market and the second largest tourist origin. “The growth of China-Philippines relations, embodying common wishes of our peoples, has been generating more and more tangible benefits for the people and brought about a closer China-Philippines community of shared future.” Huang also acknowledged the Philippines’ impressive economic growth. “Since President Duterte took office, the Philippines has made impressive achievement at various areas. Standing among the region’s fastest-growing economies, the Philippines sustains its strong growth momentum with substantial headway made in the domestic peace and reconciliation process,” Huang said. “Filipinos are now more satisfied with their better-off lives.

Zhao’s duty as a Chinese ambassador to the Philippines came to a close as Manila and Beijing forged warmer ties under the Duterte administration.
Duterte has been criticized for supposedly kowtowing to China’s aggressive claim in the West Philippine Sea.

Philippines,15992,mb.com.ph,2018-04-03T14:30:10Z,China says it has made real efforts toward establishing Vatican relations – Manila Bulletin,"BEIJING – China has made real efforts toward establishing relations with the Vatican, a Chinese official said on Tuesday, as expectations grow for a landmark accord between the Holy See and Beijing on the appointment of bishops.
Chinese Catholics are split between those who attend officially sanctioned churches run by government-approved bishops and technically illegal “underground” churches, the vast majority of which are loyal to the Vatican.
Full relations would give the Church a legal framework to look after all of China’s estimated 12 million Catholics and move on to focus on Catholic growth in a country where Protestant churches are already growing fast.
The details of a framework accord that could eventually lead to diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Beijing were worked out when a Vatican delegation visited China late last year.
“From our government’s prospective we have always maintained an honest desire to improve relations and the Chinese government has always made real efforts (towards this),” Chen Zongrong, former vice head of the State Administration for Religious Affairs, said at a news briefing.
Tuesday’s remarks follow a statement last Thursday from the Vatican that, although dialogue between the two sides continues, the deal was not about to be signed, after reports suggested it might be completed in March.
Under the expected formal deal, the Vatican will have a say in negotiations for the appointment of future bishops.
Another issue that will have to be resolved is self-ruled Taiwan, which maintains formal diplomatic ties with the Vatican. China, however, considers Taiwan a wayward province with no right to state-to-state relations.
Chen, who lost his position during a reshuffle of government departments China announced last month, added that channels of communication with the Vatican were unimpeded and Beijing hoped the Roman Catholic Church could meet it halfway.
However, religion in China must be independent of outside influence and organized within the country, he said.
Asked if denying the pope total authority to appoint bishops infringed upon the religious freedom of Chinese Catholics, Chen said, “I don’t accept that idea, and in the religious lives and practices of numerous Catholics, this does not exist.”
Xiao Hong, a former spokeswoman of the agency, said China was actively pursuing talks with the Vatican
News of the impending deal has split Catholic communities across China and some faith leaders and believers both in and outside China have been critical of the accord.

China opened its new embassy in the Burkina Faso capital of Ouagadougou on Thursday after the impoverished Sahel state stunned Taiwan by switching diplomatic ties to Beijing.
The official opening comprised the unveiling of a plaque in an upmarket hotel where the embassy is being housed temporarily while a new building for it is constructed.
“Today is a historic day,” declared Vice Prime Minister Hu Chunhua, who led a major delegation to Ouagadougou to oversee the event.
“As of today, the embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Burkina Faso is open,” Hu said, describing the mission as the “driver of Chinese-Burkinabe friendship.”
“Burkina Faso is honored to welcome you on its soil… after a break of 24 years,” Prime Minister Paul Kaba Thieba, said in reply.
The opening of the embassy “is a strong signal of the importance that the highest authorities in Burkina Faso and China attach to relations of friendship and cooperation between the two countries.”
With the exception of eSwatini — the new name for Swaziland — Burkina Faso had been the last African state to maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
Taipei has been competing with Beijing for international recognition since the People’s Republic was founded in 1949.
China deems Taiwan, to where the defeated Nationalists retreated, to be a renegade province, and isolating it internationally is a key objective.
On May 24, Burkina Faso announced it was breaking ties with Taiwan because of “changes in the world (and) the current socio-economic challenges facing our country.”
The move came as a shock to Taiwan, prompting the immediate resignation of its foreign minister, Joseph Wu. The island is now left with only 18 diplomatic allies around the world.
China’s diplomatic offensive south of the Sahara has gone hand-in-hand with lavish infrastructure projects and huge contracts to purchase resources.
Chinese teams have already arrived in Burkina Faso to work on cooperation schemes, including the building of a large hospital in Bobo-Dioulasso, the country’s second-largest city.
Before leaving on Friday, Hu is expected to meet President Roch Christian Kabore and invite him to make his first official visit to China in September, when Beijing hosts a China-Africa summit.

China increased diplomatic pressure on Taiwan on Saturday by urging the self-ruled island’s last African ally, Swaziland, to align with Beijing as Burkina Faso re-established Chinese ties.
Taiwan, which is claimed by China as its own, is Beijing’s most sensitive territorial issue. Beijing says Taiwan is merely a Chinese province, with no right to state-to-state relations.
China has mounted a concerted campaign over the past two years to lure away Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic allies, as it seeks to pressure Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who it fears wants to push for the island’s formal independence.
Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo but will not be bullied by China and will defend Taiwan and its democracy.
On Thursday, the West African state of Burkina Faso said it was severing ties with Taiwan, the second country in a month to abandon Taipei, following the Dominican Republic.
Taiwan now has only one diplomatic ally left in Africa — the tiny kingdom of Swaziland — and official relations with just 18 countries worldwide, many of them poor nations in Central America and the Pacific such as Belize and Nauru.
Speaking to reporters in Beijing after signing an agreement to re-establish relations with Burkina Faso, the Chinese government’s top diplomat State Councillor Wang Yi noted that only one African state had yet to come over to China.
“We sincerely hope that this county will join the family of China-Africa friendship at an early date,” Wang said, with Burkinabe Foreign Minister Alpha Barry at his side.
Wang added he was confident that all of Africa would stand by China’s side “in the historic cause of China’s full national reunification”.
Taiwan has accused China of using dollar diplomacy to lure away its allies, promising generous aid packages, charges China has denied. Tsai visited Swaziland in April to shore up ties.
DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE
Some countries have switched back and forth between Beijing and Taipei several times. It is the second time Burkina has cut ties with Taiwan. It last did so in 1973, before resuming relations with Taipei in 1994.
Barry said a delegation of Chinese experts would visit in the coming days to assess the county’s needs for development assistance, hopefully in time for an agreement by September when President Roch Marc Kabore would be in Beijing for a summit between China and African leaders.
“Burkina Faso intends to fully benefit from the strength and expertise of this county, seeking its support on many social and economic development projects in our own country,” Barry said.
China is Africa’s largest trade partner, with massive investments in mining, construction and banking, though it has been less active to date in Burkina.
Burkina is the fourth country to cut ties with Taiwan since Tsai came to office, following the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe and Panama.

Philippines,1275,inquirer.net,2012-08-27T16:04:33Z,"Philippine envoy to China might be replaced, says DFA chief","MANILA, Philippines–Ambassador to China Sonia Brady, who was recovering slowly from a stroke, might be replaced, Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario said on Monday.
“There is that possibility [that she would be replaced], yes,’’ Del Rosario told reporters in a chance interview after rites marking National Heroes’ Day at the Libingan ng mga Bayani (Heroes’ Cemetery) in Taguig City.

Del Rosario, who visited Brady in Beijing last Saturday following her stroke, said he would “have to discuss’’ the matter of her possible replacement with President Benigno Aquino III.
“She’s not able to speak,’’ he said when asked if Brady expressed any intention to quit for health reasons. “She’s recovering slowly. Hopefully if the recovery rate continues, we may be able to bring her back to the Philippines.’’
Del Rosario said she was “being well cared for’’ and the Chinese foreign ministry was “monitoring the situation very carefully.’’
Brady, 71, was rushed to hospital after she passed out in her residence in Beijing last Wednesday. She earlier served as ambassador to China from 2006 to 2012.
Del Rosario, who also met with Chinese counterpart Minister Yang Jiechi in Beijing, said this has no effect on Manila’s efforts at finding solutions to its dispute with Beijing over some parts of the West Philippine Sea.
“We have a charge (d’affaires) there. So I think there would be no adverse impact to that,’’ he said.
While Brady was recovering, the “deputy chief of mission’’ took over the affairs of the embassy, foreign affairs officials said.
Del Rosario also said deploying ships anew to Panatag Shoal was “being contemplated’’ by the President.
“I think the President is contemplating that,’’ he said.

Manila and Beijing have been locked in a standoff over the ownership of the resource-rich shoal, also called Scarborough Shoal, in the South China Sea, which Manila calls the West Philippine Sea.
Manila has been seeking a diplomatic solution to the dispute, which began when Philippine maritime authorities caught Chinese fishermen with supposedly illegally harvested turtles and coral already loaded onto their vessel.
China claims sovereignty over nearly all of the sea, which is believed to hold vast amounts of oil and gas, is one of the region’s most important fishing grounds, and is home to shipping lanes that are vital to global trade.
The Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan claim parts of the sea.

Philippines,5895,manilastandard.net,2015-04-21T00:01:00Z,"PH, Vietnam eye strategic partnership vs Beijing","THE Philippines and Vietnam are now trying to forge a strategic partnership in the face of the ever-expanding territorial claims of China in the South China Sea. Both countries will take the process a step further when they hold bilateral talks at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit next week, officials said on Monday. “The details of the proposed strategic partnership are still being defined and worked out by the two countries. That’s the current status,” said Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. during a press briefing in Malacanang. In a separate press briefing, Department of Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Luis Cruz said the strategic partnership will be one of the items to be discussed in the bilateral meeting between Manila and Hanoi during the ASEAN Summit in Malaysia next week. President Benigno Aquino III and Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang had earlier agreed to crafting a road map for the strategic partnership. “We agreed to convene the joint committee in December to start discussions on the roadmap towards a strategic partnership with Vietnam, which will essentially focus on improving trade, investment, and people-to-people exchanges,” Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario had said. “We also agreed to enhance cooperation in agriculture and to look for ways to strengthen maritime cooperation, such as in search-and-rescue and marine environment protection, oil spills preparedness, among others,” Del Rosaio also said. So far, the Philippines only has two strategic partners, namely the United States and Japan. Del Rosario said the venue for the joint committee meeting has yet to be firmed up. Del Rosario had said the strategic partnership agreement was “mostly driven by our close ties with Vietnam.”“We actually have entered into a strong commitment to be able to bring our relations closer, and the way to do this is through some form of a comprehensive strategic partnership. We still have to craft exactly what we mean by that,” del Rosario said. “But I think there’s enough of a history in terms of our relations and the fact that we have very close ties to get us to where we want to go,” he added. The Foreign Affairs chief said an inter-agency meeting will be convened ahead of the December joint committee dialog to firm up the Philippine inputs for the road map. Del Rosario said both Aquino and Truong have agreed to mutually support each other’s chairmanship of APEC – Philippines in 2015 and Vietnam in 2017. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung proposed the strategic partnership with Manila during his meeting with Aquino in May in Malacañang. “Both our nations are looking forward to jointly determining the prerequisites in forging a roadmap towards a strategic partnership...We face common challenges as maritime nations and as brothers in Asean. I believe continued cooperation between the Philippines and Vietnam will enable us to better protect our maritime resources,” Aquino said in May after his meeting with Nguyen.",0,,,"{'VNM': ['Socialist Republic of Vietnam', 'Hanoi', 'South China Sea'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Malacañang'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'MYS': ['Malaysia'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'JPN': ['Japan']}",diplomatic_recognition,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,10582,manilatimes.net,2016-10-23T01:07:17Z,PH to keep US diplomatic ties,"PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte on Saturday clarified he would not sever the Philippines’ ties with the United States, following an announcement in China that he planned to “separate” from Washington in economic and military terms.
In a news conference in Davao City after his arrival from a state visit to China, Duterte said his declaration of a separation from the US was about pursuing a more independent foreign policy.
“You have to take my words in the context of what I have been saying all along. It’s not severance of ties. When you say severance of ties you cut the diplomatic relations. I cannot do that,” Duterte told reporters.
He said cutting diplomatic ties with the US would not be according “to the best interest of my country that we maintain that relationship.”
“Why? Because there are many Filipinos in the United States,” the President added.
Before Chinese businessmen in Beijing on Thursday, Duterte announced a “separation” from the US in military and economic aspects, in favor of China and Russia.
However the President explained early on Saturday that this “separation” only meant charting “another way” in terms of foreign policy.
“Separation of my foreign policy, that it need not dovetail [with]the foreign policy of America. That’s what I meant actually … Sever means to cut. Separate is just to chart another way of doing it,” he said.
“In the past and until I became President, we always follow what the United States [wants]… We follow. Pasunod-sunod tayo. Hindi ako magsunod [We always followed. I won’t follow],” Duterte added.
No plans to visit US
The President indicated that he had no plans to visit the US.
Asked if American companies like business process outsourcing companies should worry about the economic aspect of the “separation,” the President said: “I worry that they would not get out of this country, that you have to force them. That is my worry.”
On whether or not his “separation” would affect defense agreements with the US like the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, Duterte said, “Maybe.”
“But I would have to consult the military, the police and everybody because at the end of the day, it is all security,” he said.
Asked about his hopes to form stronger ties with China and Russia, Duterte said these could take the form of a “military alliance” or an “economic bloc.”
Turning point
The visit to China, he said, was “a turning point in our shared history.” The President boasted of the financing and business deals forged during his visit to China, valued at $24 billion.
“My state visit to China signalled a turning point in our shared history and showed that both countries are fully capable of working together for mutual beneficial cooperation even as we remain committed to settle disputes peacefully, in full adherence of international law,” the President said in his arrival speech.
Beijing and Manila agreed to resume bilateral talks on their West Philippine Sea (South China Sea) dispute, both sides said Friday, insisting that contentious issues were “not the sum total” of their relationship.
Deeper explanation
The US, meanwhile, will leave to its top diplomat for Asia, Daniel Russel, the clarification on President Duterte’s declaration of separation.
Russel, the assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, arrived in Manila Saturday. He will stay in the country until October 25 for talks with his counterparts, among other activities.
State department spokesman John Kirby said a “deeper explanation” was needed after Duterte said his “separation” comment in Beijing did not mean cutting diplomatic ties with the US.
“I’ll let President Duterte speak for his comments. As I said yesterday (Friday), when we heard what he initially said in Beijing, it was confusing and we would be interested in hearing a deeper explanation of what it meant. Now he’s said what he said today (Saturday) and we’ll see where the conversations go [with Assistant Secretary Russel],” Toner said in a news briefing in Washington.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing respects Duterte’s foreign policy tack.
“We believe that he will make independent foreign policies and choices with the interests of his country and the people in mind,” she said in a news briefing in Beijing on Friday.
She said, however, that no country should hold a “cold-war or zero-sum mentality.”",1,,,"{'None': ['Asia'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Washington', 'Pacific'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Davao'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'South China Basin'], 'RUS': ['Russian Federation']}",diplomatic_recognition,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

In its statement, the DFA noted that Basilio, who also served as Philippine Representative to the United Nations in Geneva and Sweden, would also be entitled to concurrent jurisdiction over Korea and Mongolia as the new envoy to China.

President Benigno Aquino III had earlier said his appointment of a senior diplomat to the post showed Manila’s resolve to achieve a peaceful solution to its territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea).
Basilio’s appointment comes at a time of heightened tensions in the disputes, with the Philippines expressing concern over Beijing’s reported new maritime rules that authorized its border police to board, search and expel foreign vessels that enter what it considers its waters.
Zhang Hua, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Manila, had earlier expressed China’s optimism over Basilio’s nomination, saying that it hoped that the “early appointment of the new ambassador may facilitate the communication between both sides and the development of our bilateral relations.”
Aside from Basilio, the DFA noted that the following had also been granted their appointments as new ambassadors:

Philippines,4431,inquirer.net,2014-06-07T04:17:14Z,Binay flexes diplomatic muscles with Chinese envoy,"MANILA, Philippines—Two years ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Vice President Jejomar Binay appeared to be flexing his diplomatic muscles by holding “back channel” efforts with Chinese officials, a source from the Filipino-Chinese community said.
The source, who was privy to the meeting but did not want to be identified for lack of authority to speak on the matter, said Binay held a low-key meeting on Thursday night with top Chinese Embassy officials to lay the groundwork toward patching frayed relations between the Philippines and China over competing claims on territory.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to the source, new Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua hosted a dinner for the Binay family at the envoy’s residence in Makati City, on the same day that the Philippine government bared fresh Chinese incursions in the West Philippine Sea.
The territorial dispute, which has brought Manila and Beijing farther apart following several incidents this year, was however not on the menu during the dinner that included China’s chargé d’affaires Sun Xiangyang, the Vice President’s wife and former Makati Mayor Elenita Binay, Binay children Sen. Nancy Binay, Makati Mayor Jejomar Erwin Binay Jr., Rep. Abigail Binay and the Vice President’s longtime associate, Employers Confederation of the Philippines president Edgardo G. Lacson.
The source could not confirm whether the dinner-meeting with the Chinese officials had the blessing of President Aquino.
“It was a purely social gathering, no different from the dinners hosted for the family by new ambassadors,” according to Binay’s spokesperson, Joey Salgado.
One voice
In September 2012, Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV claimed that he was tasked to conduct back channel efforts with China, which did not sit well with Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario.
According to the DFA official, “… while back-channeling has its purpose, in our case it’s doing more harm than good. It is important that we speak with one voice on this matter.”
The source said the Chinese officials were aware that Binay was the leading presidential contender in 2016 based on recent surveys.
In April, Sun issued a statement saying the Philippines’ decision to seek the United Nation’s arbitration in the West Philippine Sea dispute would “seriously damage” bilateral relations with China. He urged the Aquino administration to “correct its mistake and come back to the right track of resolving the disputes through bilateral negotiations.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The meeting happened nearly two months after Binay and Zhao first met officially on April 15, when the Chinese ambassador paid a courtesy call on the Vice President at the Coconut Palace.
Zhao arrived in Manila on Feb. 23 and began his tour as China’s envoy in the Philippines on April 7, when he presented his credentials to President Aquino.

Philippines,21155,mb.com.ph,2019-06-17T17:49:19Z,Palace: Too early to diminish diplomatic relations with China,"By Genalyn Kabiling
It would be premature to diminish the country’s diplomatic relations with China and demand an apology over the reported ramming of a Filipino boat by a Chinese vessel, according to a Palace official.
As some concerned group demanded China’s accountability for the maritime incident, Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo asserted that both the Philippines and China are still conducting separate inquiries into the Recto Bank incident.
The government wants to get the facts about the incident before making a decision on the matter, Panelo added.
“Huwag na muna tayong mag-jump into conclusions. Tingnan natin exactly – ano ba talaga nangyari? Sa totoo lang, lahat tayo we’re just observers. Hindi pa natin alam eh, kasi the facts are not yet in. You have to investigate [Let’s not jump into conclusions. Let’s find out what really happened. We’re just observers. We don’t know yet because the facts are not yet in. You have to investigate],” he said during a Palace press briefing.
“We have to determine exactly kung ano ang totoo sa dalawang version. We have to cautiously walk on this. Hindi pupuwede iyong bigla-bigla tayong magsasalita ng ganito, eh ni wala pa tayong facts [We have to determine exactly which of the two versions are true. We have to cautiously walk on this. We can hastily make statements since we don’t have the facts yet],” he said.
Senator Risa Hontiveros earlier called on President Duterte to “downgrade” the country’s ties with China after the Chinese vessel abandoned the Filipino fishermen following a ship collision. She said the downgrading of Philippine-China ties would upgrade the country’s position in seeking justice for the aggrieved fishermen and in defending our sovereignty.
Panelo also considered the clamor to seek China’s apology over the maritime incident as premature.
“Wala pang facts eh [There are no facts yet]. We have to know the facts first,” he said.
Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon earlier called on the government to demand an apology from China over the bullying incident in the country’s waters. He said China should be held accountable for the incident, adding the country must elevate the case to the United Nations and other international forum.
On Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Carpio’s claim that the Recto Bank incident was a violation of United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Panelo maintained that such observation was premature pending the investigation into the incident.
A Chinese vessel hit and sank a Filipino vessel in Recto Bank last week, and reportedly left the fishermen stranded at sea.
Manila has filed a diplomatic protest, asking China to investigate the incident and impose sanctions against the Chinese crew that abandoned the distressed fishermen. It also warned that the country might cut ties with China if the ramming of the Filipino vessel is proven to be an intentional aggressive act.
China, however, insisted that there was no such thing as hit and run incident in the South China Sea.
The crew supposedly attempted to rescue the fishermen but fled the area after being besieged by other Filipino fishing boats.
Meantime, Panelo said he has no information about the President’s supposed meeting with the fishermen involved in the incident at the Palace.
“As far as I know, wala akong narinig na request at wala ring nag-imbita. Kasi nga wala pa eh, malabo pa nga iyong facts eh [As far as I know, I did not hear about any request. There was also no invitation because there is none yet. The facts are still unclear],” he said.
Asked if the President is interested to meet the fishermen, Panelo said: “If you’re speaking of possibilities, then limitless ang possibilities.”",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'South China Hotel Fuyang'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Claro M Recto', 'Malabo']}",diplomatic_recognition,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

There are millions of Filipinos waiting outside, more brighter than you, more smart,' he said.'But, they are not well-known because they are not politicians.

Philippines,9930,manilastandard.net,2016-09-17T00:01:00Z,Gloria cleared in ZTE mess,"“IT ain’t no sin if you crack a few laws now and then, just so long as you don’t break any.” That was how the Sandiganbayan concluded its decision junking the remaining corruption case against former President and now Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo over the $329-million national broadband network (NBN) project involving the Chinese multinational company ZTE Corporation. The court’s fourth division quoted the 1937 American movie “Every Day’s A Holiday” in granting two demurrers to evidence in the graft and ethics cases lodged against Arroyo, her husband Jose Miguel Arroyo and former elections chief Benjamin Abalos. The former leader’s lawyer Lawrence Arroyo said Arroyo was deeply grateful for the decision that was filed against her in 2011, a year into the adminisration of former President Benigno Aquino III. “[Mrs. Arroyo] has always kept her faith in the judiciary and our courts have not failed to fearlessly render justice. Our courts have not allowed themselves to be swayed by public opinion or perception,” the lawyer said in a statement. He said the courts’ decisions to grant their demurrers in the NBN-ZTE case, PCSO case, and the P5.4-million civil suit filed against her by a religious group proves the charges she faced were all weak. In its decision, the Sandiganbayan said the prosecution failed to prove that Arroyo was interested in personal gain from the NBN project, which required the discretionary approval of the National Economic and Development Authority board which Mrs. Arroyo chaired when she was President. The Sandiganbayan said the cancellation of the contract on Oct. 2, 2007 proved that Arroyo was not interested in seeing the implementation of the project because she was looking forward to personal gain. Even the fact that Arroyo met with officials of ZTE Corp. in Shenzhen, China in November 2006 did not prove that she accepted favors or gifts from foreign officials.“There was no clear and indubitable proof presented by the prosecution that accused PGMA was the recipient. As a matter of fact, there was no evidence introduced on who made the payment,” the ruling read. The court said the prosecution failed to prove that the NBN-ZTE contract was “grossly and manifestly disadvantageous” to the government. The Sandiganbayan likewise took the prosecution to task for failing to establish the supposed conspiracy between the three officials and then-transportation secretary Leandro Mendoza for the contract to be signed. “This failure to specify the circumstances establishing conspiracy among the four accused is violative of their right to be informed of the accusations hurled against them,” the court said. With the project cancelled during the Arroyo administration, the Sandiganbayan said there was no longer any contract to refer to when the Ombudsman filed the cases against the former President in 2011. Arroyo was charged with one count each of violation of Section 3 (g) and 3 (i) of Republic Act (RA) 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and Section 7 (d) of RA 6713 of the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees in connection with the NBN deal, which was allegedly overpriced by more than 50 percent of its actual cost of $130 million.

And tagging along are three congressmen who are out on bail for pending cases in the Sandiganbayan.

Mr. Duterte and Xi will discuss pressing issues and common threats such as violent extremism, terrorism, and drug trafficking when they meet on April 10, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Manuel Teehankee said in a press briefing in Malacañang.
South China Sea dispute
As for the dispute in the South China Sea that Beijing is claiming almost in its entirety, Teehankee said there was a possibility this could be discussed.
“I think the President has been very clear that he maintains the Philippine position and the meetings are based on mutual respect and equality among nations,” Teehankee said.
Mr. Duterte will address the Boao Forum (BFA), also on April 10, Teehankee said, adding this is a privilege for the country and shows that the President is considered a leader in the region.
“Addressing the BFA Plenary is a singular privilege for the Philippines and a privilege for acknowledging the President’s role and leadership in Asia and the Asean region,” he said.
The Sandiganbayan on Friday issued travel leaves to Representatives Antonio Floirendo Jr. of Davao del Norte, Arthur Yap of Bohol and Luis Raymund Villafuerte Jr. of Camarines Sur who were invited to be part of the President’s contingent.
President’s invitation
ADVERTISEMENT
In an urgent April 5 motion for leave to travel, Floirendo—one of Mr. Duterte’s biggest campaign contributors in the 2016 elections—told the antigraft court’s Sixth Division that he received the invitation from the Office of the Presidential Protocol.
Floirendo was accused of graft in connection with the allegedly disadvantageous land deal between the Tagum Agricultural Development Co. and a penal colony in Davao. He was ordered arrested last Feb. 21.
Yap is facing a separate set of cases involving pork barrel funds during his term as agriculture secretary, while Villafuerte is accused of graft arising from the Camarines Sur provincial government’s allegedly anomalous purchase of petroleum products when he was still governor.
Teehankee said the President would push for inclusive growth during the forum, which would gather world leaders, businessmen, and members of the academe.
Hong Kong stopover
Aside from Mr. Duterte, also attending the forum are the leaders of Austria, Mongolia, Pakistan, Singapore, and the Netherlands, as well as United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde.
After meeting with Xi, Mr. Duterte will fly to Hong Kong where he will meet with members of the Filipino community.

Two employees at the Court of Appeals (CA) are making a killing selling decisions to litigants who can afford to pay.
These corrupt employees are assigned at a certain section in the CA.
When an appeal is sent to the appellate court, the papers are filed in that section.
The two employees contact the litigant and offer to “fix” the case in the litigant’s favor.
The duo then gets in touch with the assistants of a justice to whom the appeal is assigned.
Each justice is provided with lawyer subordinates who write decisions for the justice.
Because of the volume of cases they handle, most justices leave the crafting of the decision to their assistants.
Some just sign the decisions without reading them, according to my CA mole.
The innocent justice, who’s busy making money on other big revenue-making cases, signs the decision and is left out of the deal.
In street lingo, the justice was nabukulan (made a fool of).
Most justices are wise to the ways of their assistants, and make them the conduits to litigants.
That’s the way many cases are decided at the Court of Appeals.
That’s how our justice system works.

Philippines,33315,inquirer.net,2021-07-11T05:50:02Z,Stratbase: 4 contracts bagged by Chinese firms ‘onerous’,"A think-tank has echoed the concerns of several sectors over four “onerous” multibillion-peso contracts the government had awarded to Chinese companies, including one that was implicated in the graft-plagued Northrail project of the Arroyo administration.
Collating the results of its study on the projects, the Stratbase Albert del Rosario Institute noted that these infrastructure projects “disregarded the rule of law and characteristically lacked transparency and accountability.”
ADVERTISEMENT
The study covered the signed agreements for the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project, the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project, Dito Telecommunity and the controversial Safe Philippines Project, which would install thousands of security cameras in major cities around the country.
“It is the responsibility of the government to ensure transparency and accountability when it comes to transactions with other states, especially for foreign investments,” said Dindo Manhit, president of Stratbase.
In a paper written by political science professor Edwin Santiago of the De La Salle University, it was found that the agreements contained provisions that were “deemed onerous and inimical to the interests of the Philippines, such as the waiver of sovereign immunity.”
For example, Santiago said, the P4.37-billion Chico River project included a confidentiality clause that made it difficult for the public to access and scrutinize the entire contract as mandated by the Constitution.
“While more information was disclosed in other projects, they were still significantly incomplete,” he lamented.
He also noted the insufficient information as to how the project was awarded to China CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd., which was also involved in the scuttled $503-million Northrail project in 2008.
“Many of the pertinent documents relating to the project remain unavailable to the public,” Santiago said.
On the Kaliwa Dam Project, Santiago noted that the Commission on Audit had already flagged the bidding for the P18.7-billion project, which the indigenous people of Rizal and Quezon provinces had also questioned.
“It is practically the same level of information dissemination insofar as the bidding process for the selection of [Dito] and the Safe Philippines project are concerned,” he said.
Former Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales earlier urged the public to demand transparency in the implementation of projects funded mainly by China.

Philippines,10989,inquirer.net,2016-12-01T17:30:28Z,"27 of 1,316 Chinese 'illegals' in Clark flee from detention - BI","MANILA — Fifty-seven Chinese nationals who were among the 1,316 nabbed in Clark, Pampanga, for overstaying or working without permits, escaped from detention early Thursday amidst bribery allegations in exchange for their release.
The Bureau of Immigration said 30 of the 57 escapees have returned as of Thursday afternoon, leaving 27 foreigners still unaccounted for.
ADVERTISEMENT
BI spokesperson Tonette Mangrobang said the 57 Chinese nationals allegedly left the Fontana Food Center at the Fontana Leisure Park, where they have been detained since last week.
“They said they left the food center to go back to their villas to get some rest,” Mangrobang said, quoting the accounts of the 30 who came back.
The Chinese embassy is trying to convince the managers of the 27 missing foreigners to advise their employees to return to the BI’s custody.
Those who returned were convinced by the embassy and their bosses to come back.
“As we speak, the embassy is convincing the managers of the 27 Chinese to bring forward their wards because they don’t have a place to go. Their passports were confiscated by the BI,” Mangrobang said.
She added that all of the 1,316 Chinese arrested last November 24 were placed in the hold-departure list and could not flee the country.
The Chinese have been detained at the Fontana Food Center by BI and police personnel since the operation on the unauthorized online gambling firm allegedly run by the Macau-based gambling tycoon Jack Lau.
Earlier, Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II accused Lau of bribing him and the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. chairperson Andrea Domingo for the release of the Chinese.
Mangrobang said the BI would be open to an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the escape of the 57 Chinese.
ADVERTISEMENT
“The (Chinese) embassy people were also mad at these 57 because all efforts are being done by the embassy and the BI to facilitate the speedy disposition and processing of their deportation cases,” she added.
The BI clarified that it has filed charges against 1,296 foreigners, ranging from overstaying, violating the conditions of their visas, and working at the unlicensed online gambling firm.
Meanwhile, Mangrobang said the BI would wait for the official report on the escape to determine if additional charges should be filed against the 57 escapees. SFM

Philippines,12879,inquirer.net,2017-06-28T14:48:39Z,PH gov't won’t meddle with probe on Chinese donor of mega rehab center,"Malacañang is keeping its hands off China’s corruption probe of businessman Huang Rulun, who had donated a mega drug rehabilitation facility to the Philippines, saying it was an “internal” matter that it would let Beijing handle.
But Assistant Communications Secretary Marie Banaag said the Philippines backs China’s drive to clean up its ranks.
ADVERTISEMENT
A report from the Financial Times said Huang faced bribery allegations and was removed from his post in the Fujian province political consultative conference.
Huang is a billionaire who had also been described as a philanthropist in earlier reports.
“That is, of course, internal to China. Rest assured that President (Rodrigo) Duterte is one with the People’s Republic of China in its drive against corruption. Like I said, that’s up to China,” Banaag told reporters when asked about the corruption probe.
Asked if the Philippines would continue to receive donations from Huang, Banaag said she does not know yet.
President Duterte had been all praises for Huang for his donation of a 10,000-bed mega drug rehabilitation facility in Nueva Ecija.
In a speech last December, Mr. Duterte said Huang had his “endearing love and gratitude,” and narrated how the Chinese businessman came to see him and offered to build the rehabilitation facility.

He also said Huang had not asked for anything from him after building the center.
“So, and after the construction he passed by here, shook my hand, went out, I never heard from him again. I said, so, the last minute benevolence of one human being in this world really helped us,” he said.
The President’s praise for Huang came amid warming ties between Beijing and Manila, as Mr. Duterte reached out to the Philippines’ giant neighbor.

Philippines,6140,inquirer.net,2015-06-04T17:47:03Z,De Lima on BBL payola: Simply foolish talk,"ALLEGATIONS that money from a Chinese fugitive was used to bribe lawmakers in exchange for supporting the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) is nothing more than an idle talk, Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said Thursday after meeting with senior Immigration officials.
De Lima said her initial impression is that the rulings handed down by the Bureau of Immigration in favor of Wang Bo were grounded on factual basis.
ADVERTISEMENT
“While the insinuations are serious, there is no firm, solid or concrete basis to make such a supposition that money probably changed hands,” de Lima said.
She added that the commissioners raised a number of valid grounds in turning down the request People’s Republic of China for Wang’s repatriation to Beijing supposedly to face a criminal indictment of illegally operating a casino in the communist country.
The 31-year-old Wang, wanted by Interpol and the Chinese government for allegedly embezzling $100 million, is supposed to be released from BI detention, but De Lima stopped the order signed by immigration officials.
In the closed-door meeting with de Lima were immigration commissioner Siegfred B. Mison and Associate Commissioners Gilberto U. Repizo and Abdullah S. Mangotara.
Following allegations that Wang provided hundreds of millions of pesos to bribe lawmakers to approve the administration’s pet legislation, the Bangsamoro Basic Law, de Lima said: “I had to intervene; I had to issue an order holding in abeyance the release of Wang Bo, on account of the ground of reconsideration. So, for my own enlightenment, I want to have the facts clear.”
A legislative inquiry has been called following the allegations.
Meanwhile, Replizo said there had been no reason to reverse the decision of the BI commissioners ordering Wang’s release since a belated request from the Chinese embassy for his custody had not been “authenticated” and was a mere photocopy of a supposed official request.
“Iyon po ang aming hinahanap na deklarasyon , na dokumento ng Chinese embassy na galing sa kanilang tamang opisyal at authenticated,” he said.
“Sa amin po kasi, sa Bureau of Immigration, halimbawa ikaw yung nakulong, pag ika’y nakakulong kasi, ika’y blacklisted. O ikaw ay may kaso halimbawa, hindi ka makakapag-renew ng visa hangga’t hindi mo naki-clear. Ngayon, kung ika’y convicted, ika’y matatapon. Pag ika’y na-clear, bibigyan ka ng panahon para i-update yung visa, sapagkat ikaw ay na-clear. Pero hindi po doon ang punto e. Ang punto nating pinag-uusapan ay isumite lang ng embahada, ng Chinese police ang tamang dokumento, wala dapat issue. Pipirma po kami.” Replizo added.
Wang has been detained at the BI jail in Taguig City since his arrest on Feb. 10 upon his arrival at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport from Malaysia. The Chinese Embassy sought the BI’s assistance in apprehending Wang, saying he was wanted for illegal gambling and that his passport had been canceled. AC

Philippines,20369,mb.com.ph,2019-04-11T23:06:15Z,Duterte to fire corruption-linked officials before China trip,"By Argyll Geducos
President Duterte said that he will name the officials he will fire due to corruption before he flies to China to attend the second Belt and Road Forum.
Duterte made the statement during the PDP-Laban proclamation rally in Bacolod City, less than two weeks before he makes his fourth visit to China since becoming president.
In his speech, Duterte said that he is only fulfilling his promise to rid the government of corruption.
“Lahat pinangako ko ginawa ko. Corruption medyo mabagal na talaga. Ngayon pag ikaw nasa corruption, alis ka (I am doing everything I said. Corruption is now slowing down. Now if you are involved in corruption, you will really get the boot),” he said.
“Next week when I fly back to report to work before I leave for China, marami akong tatanggalin (I will really fire a number of them),” he added.
Duterte reiterated that he is favoring no one when it comes to corruption, adding that even his closest allies were fired by him because they were linked to corruption.
“Putang ina sinabi ko na sa inyo, magkaibigan tayo, magbayad ako ng utang na loob, bigyan kita ng trabaho. Pero ang pinakausap ko sa ‘yo noon na ‘wag lang kayong pumasok sa corruption. ‘Wag ka nang magtanong kung bakit (You sons of whores, we are friends. I will repay my debt to you by giving you work but I ask you one thing: Do not get involved in corruption. Do not ask why),” he said.
“Basta sa panahon ko ‘wag ‘yan. Ayaw ko. In three years kung gusto mo… Ilang Cabinet members na ba ang pinatalsik ko? Lima, anim (Avoid that during my time. I really hate it. In three years if you want then go. How many Cabinet members have I fired already? Five? Six)?” he added.
Over the weekend, Duterte revealed that he will be firing more government officials because of corruption. While not naming them, Duterte said that making people return to process their permits is already a form of corruption.
“To me, that is corruption. Nothing else. Ang meaning niyan (What that means) is you want money so he has to go back and forth,” he said.
“That’s a warning. Pati dito sa baba, kayong mga director, lahat (Even for you in the lower ranks, the directors, everyone), national agencies. You only have 15 days to process,” he added.
Duterte then said that suspension and mere reprimanding will not work anymore.
“Ang corruption mahirap tanggalin eh. Hiyain mo, saktan mo. The only way to do it is hiyain mo tapos saktan mo. Otherwise, wala. Suspension nandiyan balik (Corruption is so hard to eliminate. You have to shame them and hurt them. That’s the only way. Otherwise, it will not work. You suspend them and they will just come back),” he said.
Malacañang earlier said that President Duterte would be announcing himself the officials that he would be firing due to corruption.

Philippines,30409,inquirer.net,2021-02-09T00:15:19Z,Duterte admits being hurt by claims of corruption in vaccine procurement,"MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte again denied on Monday that there was corruption in the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines.
ADVERTISEMENT
The money used to buy the vaccines, he said, were all borrowed from the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and the World Bank.
“So there’s no corruption here — because not one of us here holds any of the billions [borrowed],” Duterte said, speaking partly in Filipino. “So that’s the situation. That’s why it’s painful for us that there are these sweeping allegations about corruption.”
Not even the officials of the Inter-Agency Task Force against Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF) would be handling any money — not even the payments for the loans.
Duterte also asked members of the Congress to avoid making accusations, nothing that one lawmaker, whom he did not name, raised the possibility of corruption in the vaccine procurement.
“That’s my request to members of Congress,” Duterte said. “In the meantime, someone said that none of you said that, [but] one of you said that. I just won’t say who… We’ll just go into a rigmarole,” he said.
This is not the first time Duterte assured the public that there was no corruption in the government’s immunization project. Last Jan. 21, he defended Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the IATF chief implementer and vaccine czar, against allegations that there was an overpricing in the purchase of vaccines.
In that address, Duterte urged people to take their minds off corruption for awhile. It may be happening in other agencies, he said, but not in his Cabinet.
Then in his Jan. 25 speech, Duterte slammed critics of his administration who claimed that public awareness and vigilance supposedly prevented corruption in the purchase of the vaccines. He said nothing was prevented because nothing happened.
The corruption allegations centered on allegedly changing prices in the COVID-19 vaccines from Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech. Sen. Panfilo Lacson pointed out on social media that prices in the Philippines and in other countries varied greatly.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to Lacson, the Sinovac vaccine costs around $5, or roughly P240, per dose in some instances, but in the Philippines, it goes for around $38, or roughly P1,800.
Galvez then came out to criticize the allegations, saying that these were unfounded reports. However, Sen. Sonny Angara said that the point of comparison was the vaccine prices given by the Department of Health around November.
Galvez refused to divulge actual prices because of a nondisclosure agreement between the government and the vaccine manufacturers. But he said that costs would not go over P700 per dose.
However, netizens and Lacson believe that the Senate hearing on the issue and public vigilance were able to ‘prevent’ corruption — something which Duterte frowned upon.

Philippines,29513,inquirer.net,2020-12-10T14:27:45Z,Palace confident of FDA review process amid bribery claims vs Sinovac,"MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang is confident that the country’s vaccine screening authorities will not fall into bribery amid reports that Sinovac, one of several COVID-19 vaccines being lined up for use in the Philippines, reportedly bought its way to get past Chinese regulators before.
ADVERTISEMENT
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said President Duterte has full trust in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief Eric Domingo in ensuring that the country will only use efficient and safe coronavirus vaccines.
“Consistent po tayo na papayagan lang natin magamit ang mga bakuna na napatunayang nang ligtas at mabisa laban sa COVID-19,” Roque said in his regular press briefing Thursday.
“Buong buo po ang tiwala ni Presidente kay Dr. Domingo, so pagdating po diyan sa allegations on bribery, tingin ko po hindi mangyayari iyan sa Pilipinas,” he added.
In a Dec. 4 report, US newspaper Washington Post said Sinovac Biotech had been found to have a record of bribing Chinese drug regulators to secure vaccine approvals, which had raised serious questions about its products’ safety.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said the FDA, as well as the vaccine experts panel, are “aware” of the report and will validate the veracity of the allegations against the Chinese drugmaker.
According to the report, Sinovac’s CEO admitted to giving more than $83,000 to a regulatory official from 2002 to 2011.
“Those years corresponded to Sinovac’s breakout period when the biotech startup founded in 2001 was handpicked by Beijing officials to lead the development of vaccines for SARS, avian flu and swine flu,” Washington Post said.
Sinovac is currently seeking the approval of the FDA to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials here after passing the initial evaluation of the country’s vaccine experts panel. It has already started delivering vaccines to Indonesia.
The government’s pandemic response chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said Sinovac’s coronavirus vaccine may be the first to be rolled out in the country.
He also assured that Sinovac’s vaccine is safe as it utilizes the “classical inactivated virus platform.”

Philippines,6340,manilastandard.net,2015-06-25T00:01:00Z,2 BI execs sanctioned,"IMMIGRATION Commissioner Siegfred Mison has stripped the authority of Associate Commissioners Abdullah Mangotara and Gilberto Repizo and Executive Director Eric Dimaculangan, to sign documents in the wake of a bribery scandal that has rocked the bureau. The move was prompted by allegations that suspected Chinese crime lord Wang Bo had paid Immigration officials P400 million in exchange for a reversal of his deportation order. Under an administrative order issued by Mison, Mangotara, Repizo and Dimaculangan will no longer be able to sign documents pertaining to visa issuances and extensions, alien registration and citizenship, the lifting of orders and all other significant immigration matters. The three have been limited to reviewing, collecting and coordinating issues from the divisions, sections and units. Immigration spokesperson Elaine Tan, meanwhile, clarified that Eric Dimaculangan was not fired from the bureau, contrary to reports. “The reports are not true. All commissioners and the executive director are still in office,” said Tan. “Contrary to rumors, deputy executive secretary Eric Dimaculangan still acts as the board secretary, in addition to his visa implementation functions. “He still is the board secretary. However, Mison designated lawyer Vicente Uncad as assistant board secretary to share the responsibility in handling deportation cases,” Tan added. She said that all actions on the Wang Bo case and “collateral incidents” were before Justice Secretary Leila de Lima for determination. Wang had earlier been deported to China at the behest of Beijing, but the BI later issued another order reversing the summary deportation.Mison claimed that he recommended Wang’s deportation, but his decision was blocked by two associate immigration commissioners who argued that Wang should not be deported to China as he had committed a crime in the Philippines. De Lima had earlier issued a resolution reinstating the summary deportation order against Chinese fugitive Wang Bo. De Lima, in a resolution dated June 8, set aside the May 21 resolution of the BI’s Board of Commissioners reversing the earlier deportation order and releasing the fugitive from BI custody, and ruled in favor of Wang’s deportation. However, the implementation of the De Lima deportation order has been held in abeyance pending an investigation into allegations that a P400-million bribe was paid to prevent Wang’s deportation and other suspicious circumstances surrounding the issue, including the delay in the implementation, and eventual reversal, of the deportation order. The House committee on good governance and public accountability has already launched an investigation into the controversy and summoned all immigration commissioners. The House hearingv is expected to resume on July 7. A ranking Immigration official who requested anonymity since he was not authorized to speak, said the two associate commissioners and Dimaculangan would continue to receive their salaries for doing nothing.

(RCBC) amounting to $12,778.30 or P640,959.53; an RCBC peso account with P257,931.60; and an HSBC (Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corp.) account with HK$948,358.97 or P6.10 million.Mel Georgie Racela, Anti Money Laundering Council Secretariat executive director, and Retanal declined to elaborate on the progress of their investigation, citing the Bank Secrecy Law.Bautista supposedly has 35 separate accounts with LDB, a small thrift bank, 30 of which are in the lender’s Fort Bonificio, Taguig City branch and the remaining five in the Makati City branch.Racela and Retanal on Wednesday attended an inquiry called by the Senate Committee on Banks, led by Sen. Francis Escudero, on Bautista’s alleged ill-gotten wealth in relation to possible violations of the Anti Money Laundering Act (AMLA).Retanal said the bank accounts in question were closed in 2016 when Bautista took over as Comelec chief. Bautista served as PCGG chairman from Sept. 13, 2010 up to April 27, 2015.LDB, the 5th largest thrift bank in the country, assured the committee that it had “religiously complied” with its reportorial duties under the AMLA and signified its intention to cooperate with the investigation.Sen. Grace Poe however believes there was a deliberate move to conceal Bautista’s financial transactions amid reports that he deposited less than P500,000 every other day with LDB apparently to evade monitoring by the AMLC and BSP.“Obviously, his acts of opening several accounts with large daily deposits should have served as red flags especially since it is public knowledge that a government officer receives a modest salary,” she said.“The bank should therefore have reported all of these to the BSP and AMLC in their Covered Transactions Report. It is not enough that LDB submits reports to the BSP; the law requires that any suspicious transaction should be reported to the AMLC,” Poe said.Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon asked Retanal on whether the NBI had sought a court order to examine Bautista’s bank details.“I mentioned that in the context of protecting the general citizenry and depositors from harassment by the government because without that limitation on the authority of the NBI, the NBI can be used by the powers that be in order to harassed opponents of this administration,” he said.Escudero said closed bank accounts can be looked into because these are no longer covered by the Bank Secrecy Law.“A closed account is no longer covered by the Bank Secrecy law nor by the provisions of the General Banking Act given the absence of funds in the custody of the bank,” Escudero said after the LDB refused to answer questions regarding the closed accounts of Bautista.",0,,,"{'PHL': ['Taguig City', 'Makati City']}",bribery_economic_corruption,['Shanghai'],['Shanghai'],['Shanghai'],['Shanghai']

President Duterte solicited the help of Filipino-Chinese businessmen in the country to stop corruption in government by asserting their rights and lodging complaints against government employees or officials trying to extort them.
Duterte made the statement at the 11th Biennial National Convention and 22nd Founding Anniversary of the Chinese Filipino Business Club, Inc. at the Manila Hotel Monday evening.
In his speech, President Duterte urged Filipino-Chinese businessmen to be assertive against red tape in government.
“I cannot stop corruption, but you can help me minimize it,” the President said. “All that I ask of you is be assertive and do not surrender to the threats and the intimidations that you will encounter while they’re examining your books.”
Duterte likewise told the businessmen to report any irregularity they encounter while doing business in the country.
“’Yung lahat ng mga BIR (Bureau of Internal Revenue), lahat sa (Bureau of) Customs, tandaan mo lang ang mukha nila at pag humingi sa inyo, sabihin niyo lang sa akin at pupunta ako doon sa pantalan at ipapasok ko ang mga cargo niyo libre (Remember the faces of those from BIR and Customs and if they ask you for money, just tell me and I will go to the port personally and bring in your cargo for free),” he said.
“Just report to me in one statement a stupid guy. ‘Wag kayong matakot (Do not be afraid) because I will never also allow you to be harmed.”
Duterte assured the business sector that they can trust his government.”You can always count on us, you can count on my friends… They are all prepared to help you.”
However, he advised them to not join the government if they were not ready to honestly serve the people. “If you are not ready to be honest fundamentally, ‘wag ka pumasok sa gobyerno.

Sinovac is currently seeking the approval of the FDA to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials of its coronavirus vaccine here.
“Very objective po ang ating gagawing pagsusuri, depende lamang po sa datos at sa evidence na ipapakita nila,” FDA Director-General Eric Domingo said in a televised Laging Handa Public Briefing.
Domingo warned Sinovac that it would face sanctions once it tries to bribe Philippine regulators.
“Dito po sa Pilipinas, huwag po nilang subukang manuhol dahil magkakaproblema sila at sila po ay lalong hindi maaapprove,” the FDA chief said.
“Sa FDA po we’re going to be objective about it. We will treat the company as legitimately doing business but of course, once they try something e sila na po ang mananagot at magkakaproblema po sila ng malaki,” he added.
In a Dec. 4 report, US newspaper Washington Post said Sinovac Biotech had been found to have a record of bribing Chinese drug regulators to secure vaccine approvals, which had raised serious questions about its products’ safety.

According to the report, Sinovac’s CEO admitted to giving more than $83,000 to a regulatory official from 2002 to 2011.
“Those years corresponded to Sinovac’s breakout period when the biotech startup founded in 2001 was handpicked by Beijing officials to lead the development of vaccines for SARS, avian flu and swine flu,” Washington Post said.

While regulatory approval of Sinovac’s vaccine is still ongoing, talks about a possible supply agreement between the Philippine government and the Chinese firm is also in the works.
COVID-19 policy chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. said their meeting with Sinovac representatives last Friday was “very substantial” and that he is looking to finalize the agreement this week.

Lawyer Melvin Bermudez, legal counsel of the five foreigners, said the extension of time to file counter-affidavits was granted during a schedule hearing at the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Wednesday, July 19.
Bermudez said that on top of the language barrier, he cited the detention of his foreigner-clients as one of the difficulties in the submission of the counter-affidavits.
The five Chinese nationals charged were identified as Li Jiacheng, Xiao Liu, Yan Jiayong, Duan Haozhuan and LP Hongkun.
They were arrested during a raid conducted by operatives of the Philippine National Police- Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) at a POGO facility in Las Pinas City where around 2,700 persons were rescued including Filipinos and foreigners who are alleged to be human trafficking victims.
Bermudez said he had earlier filed a petition for habeas corpus before the Las Pinas City regional trial court (RTC) in behalf of his clients. He did not disclose the status of the petition before the trial court.

Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. discusses the West Philippine Sea issue in a meeting with President Duterte and other Cabinet members in Davao City on May 10, 2021 (Malacañang)
Locsin remembered telling this to a Portuguese representative at the United Nations (UN) when the latter asked why the Philippines does not stop its harsh war on drugs and instead legalize the drug use.
“I answered, ‘Because Portugal is the size of a sardine can with a population to match, facing the anodyne Atlantic Ocean where nothing much happens while the Philippines lies in the South China Sea, within spitting distance of China- the smuggling center of illegal drug exports in the region- and the 13th largest nation in the world,” Locsin said in a tweet without mentioning when this actual exchanges with the Portuguese diplomat transpired.
Locsin served as head of the Philippine Mission at the UN headquarters in New York from 2016 to 2018 until he was appointed by President Duterte to replace Alan Peter Cayetano.
In 2001, Portugal made history by becoming the first country in the world to decriminalize the consumption and possession of illegal drugs.
Locsin’s tweet was actually in reaction to a news report that more people died of drug overdoses in San Francisco, California last year than of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
He raised the specter of the Philippines losing its main islands due to “an addicted population” and a “cash-rich elected cartel” who will “sell the islands”.
The Philippines is still locked in a dispute with China over some features in the West Philippine Sea despite the 2016 Arbitral Award that already nullified Beijing’s excessive nine-dash line claims.
During his time as the Philippines’ envoy to the UN and later as foreign affairs chief, Locsin staunchly defended Duterte’s war-on-drugs campaign that resulted in the killings of more than 6,000 suspected users and small-time drug peddlers.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2019, Locsin said the UN was “not free to interfere” when a state chooses to take a hardline stance against crime.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'South China Basin'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Davao'], 'PRT': ['Portuguese Republic'], 'USA': ['New York', 'California', 'Manila', 'San Francisco', 'Atlantic Ocean Palm Inn']}",transnational_organization_crime,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Beijing']"

Most foreigners involved in big-time illegal drug trade in the Philippines are Chinese, Senator Richard J. Gordon said on Wednesday.
‘’We are besieged from the outside,’’ Gordon said in his preliminary statement at the start of Wednesday’s ninth committee hearing on ‘’ninja cops;’ and recycling of illegal drugs.
Gordon said these Chinese drug lords are aided in the flow of their multi-billion-peso smuggling operations into the country by crooked immigration, police and customs officials.
Most of the big time drug lords arrested and incarcerated at the New Bilibid Prisons (NBP) are Chinese, he noted.
Authorities have discovered that these jailed drug lords have turned the NBP into air-conditioned hotels complete with free use of cell phones used in directing the traffic of illegal drugs outside the prison walls, gambling operations and the entry of women to satisfy their sex drives, among others.

Philippines,2615,inquirer.net,2013-07-09T04:09:47Z,Top narc says he’s not afraid of Chinese drug lords,"MANILA, Philippines—The chief of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) on Monday brushed off allegations made by one of the agency’s personnel that he was reluctant to go after Chinese drug lords.
Speaking at the weekly flag-raising ceremony at the agency’s headquarters in Quezon City, PDEA Director General Arturo Cacdac said that launching operations against “high-value targets” was one of the main policies under his tenure.
ADVERTISEMENT
“It’s not true that I’m afraid to run after Chinese or Chinese-Filipino drug syndicates. Since I graduated from the PMA (Philippine Military Academy) in 1978, I knew that my life would be in danger,” Cacdac read from a prepared speech written in Filipino.
He said he was not afraid because what the PDEA was doing was right.
Cacdac, a retired police deputy director general, the equivalent of a three-star general in the military, was reacting to allegations made by PDEA Investigation Agent 3 Jonathan Morales that Cacdac had failed to order operations against big drug syndicates.
In an interview with ABS-CBN last week, Morales warned that the cases against arrested Chinese drug suspects might be dismissed in court because of the growing demoralization among PDEA agents.
“The cases against the arrested Chinese drug lords would only be dismissed. We may lose the evidence against them. The effort of the government and PDEA would be put to waste,” Morales said.
“I don’t understand if they are just afraid of the drug syndicates or if they are getting something from them because they don’t want to go after them.” he had also said.
But Cacdac said that only PDEA agents facing various criminal charges in the Office of the Ombudsman and other courts were frustrated by his leadership as he had ordered the filing of cases against some of them.—Marlon Ramos

In a statement released on Tuesday, China said it was ready to work out a specific plan with the Philippines in curbing the proliferation of drugs here. “China has expressed explicitly to the new administration China’s willingness for effective cooperation in this regard, and would like to work out a specific plan of action with the Philippine side,” Chinese Embassy in Manila spokesman Lingxiao Li said. Li’s statement came after President Rodrigo Duterte blamed China over some of its officials’ alleged involvement in drug trafficking. Li said China fully understood that Duterte had already made a pronouncement that he would give priority to the efforts to crack down on drug-related crimes. “When I come face to face with them, I will tell them all that is bothering me,” Duterte said in Filipino at a gathering of his San Beda College of Law classmates in Malacañang. Duterte recently accused five police generals of protecting three big-time Chinese-Filipino drug lords. At the Palace, he also noted that four Hong Kong nationals were arrested when police raided “floating shabu laboratories” in the waters off Subic.Li said China had a shared responsibility to fight all drug-related crimes. “Illicit drugs are a common enemy of the mankind. Fighting against all drug-related crimes is a shared responsibility of all countries in the world,” Li said. He denied the accusations against China and stressed that, in fact, the Chinese government had been firm in its efforts to punish all criminals. “The Chinese government has been firm and severe in drug control and in punishing all drug criminals in accordance with the laws regardless their nationalities,” Li said. On Monday, former Interior Secretary Rafael Alunan said the illegal drug trade in the Philippines was now a national crisis, and that the government and the public must understand it to know what they were up against. “This is national security crisis and we better understand what we are up against so we can do something about it,” Alunan said in a forum.

“As the regional director, I can guarantee that the theory that there are personnel within our ranks who collude with Chinese prostitution syndicates is an unvalidated assumption,” Police Maj. Gen. Debold Sinas, the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) director, said in a statement sent to reporters.

Sinas added that the NCRPO would continuously raid Chinese-run establishments that prostitute women to get rid of sex syndicates. According to him, the NCRPO was also cleansing its ranks of erring policemen.
“We have a dedicated unit working on this and guaranteed, there is zero tolerance among our ranks and I will personally ensure that such personnel will be identified and made to suffer the consequences of their ill actions,” he said.
Philippine National Police chief Archie Gamboa has also taken “strong exception” to Sen. Risa Hontiveros’ “theory” that policemen were “colluding with syndicates and protecting groups involved in Chinese prostitution in the country,” according to PNP spokesperson Police Brig. Gen. Bernard Banac.
The PNP’s Women and Children Protection Center (WCPC) and Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, as well as local police units, have been “at the forefront of law enforcement efforts to suppress not only index crime incidents, but also crimes against public morals including prostitution, gambling and illegal vices,” Banac said.
“The WCPC has been empowered even more with orders from the Chief PNP to lead the campaign against prostitution and trafficking of Filipino women, particularly by syndicated activities operated by foreign groups.” Banac added.
Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, meanwhile, tasked the PNP to enhance women’s and children’s desks nationwide and create a special unit to look specifically into Philippine offshore gaming operations (Pogo), which had been blamed for the thriving flesh trade involving Chinese nationals.
Hontiveros, the Senate committee chair on women, children, family relations and gender equality, opened on Tuesday an inquiry into the emergence of sex rings that cater mainly to male Chinese Pogo workers.
“If plenty of [these groups] get away or go unnoticed, are not under surveillance, [their establishments are] not raided, the women are not rescued, you would have doubts too that there may be personnel even within our PNP who are also colluding and being corrupted, profiting from it, even protecting those trafficking and prostitution syndicates,” she said in a TV interview. —With a report from Jeannette I.

Duterte also linked his election rival, former Interior secretary Manuel Roxas 2nd, to one of five police generals he had accused as protector of drug syndicates — retired police deputy director general Marcelo Garbo Jr.
“Nobody in the horizon of the political arena was talking about the seriousness of the drug problem. Nobody was talking about the number of crimes committed against the innocent and hapless civilians, everywhere,” the President said in a speech Friday before members of the Filipino community in Jakarta.
Duterte proceeded to the Indonesian capital for a working visit after the summits of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos on Thursday.
“If I didn’t win, the Philippines would be in danger. Why? I’ll tell you, Garbo … was the military aide of Roxas,” he said.
The President said the involvement of police officials in the drug trade emboldened him to pursue his crackdown.
“Even if it takes me the entire six years, I will do it. It will be relentless. I am sorry if you die in the process,” he said, addressing drug suspects who refuse to change their ways.
“All you have to do, my advice, is very simple: Stop,” Duterte said.
He acknowledged that over 1,000 people had died in police operations against drugs, but asked: “What really is 1,000 lives to the 3.6 million?”
Duterte was referring to his estimate of the number of drug dependents in the country, 3.6 million.
Praise for China
In his speech, Duterte praised China for its “generosity” to the Philippines, saying Beijing promised to build rehabilitation centers for drug dependents.
“They’re bringing materials. Only China is helping us,” the President said.
“Next year there will be [rehabilitation centers]. We’re preparing it now. China is helping us. I would like to thank China for being so generous,” he added.
Duterte said he could not build new rehabilitation centers because this year’s budget was prepared by the previous Aquino government.

In a statement, the BOC said the June 28 operation was led by the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service-Manila International Container Port (CIIS-MICP) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).
Armed with a letter of authority and a mission order issued by Commissioner Rey Leonardo Guerrero, the team raided a warehouse in Barangay De Ocampo.
The authorities found raw materials for cigarettes such as tobacco filler, filter paper and paper rod with an estimated value of P105 million.
Also found were one filter maker, two cigarette makers, and six packing machines worth P75 million; four boxes of tax stamps worth P18 million each for a total of P72 million; and 81 master cases of Marvel cigarettes worth P50,000 each for a total of P4.05 million.

Finished cigarette products such as Marvels, Two Moon, Mighty, and others were also discovered in the warehouse.
Assigned Customs examiners, in the presence of members of the CIIS, Enforcement and Security Service (ESS), barangay officials, and representatives of the warehouse, had begun a complete inventory of the warehouse.
Once done with the complete inventory of the regulated goods, Ramiro and CIIS Director Jeoffrey Tacio are set to recommend the issuance of a Warrant of Seizure and Detention (WSD), as well as the filing of appropriate and related charges against the warehouse operator.
“We’ve always worked on the assumption that today is our last day or our last chance to curb smuggling. I am proud of our Customs agents for going above and beyond their call of duty to protect our borders and improve our anti-smuggling initiatives,” Guerrero said in a statement.
“The smear campaign against us will not deter us from doing our work. The goal remains the same, and that’s to pursue criminals who make a mockery of our laws,” he added.
The operation was also in coordination with the National Bureau of Investigation Special Action Unit (NBI SAU).

Carmela Bastes, social worker of the City Social and Development Office, said she was confident her office and nongovernment organizations fighting human trafficking had a strong case against Tse-Yu Tai, Taiwanese and manager of Star Mega Seahorse Corp., and couple Chi Chang Ho and Xi Ping Ho.

The three foreigners operated several fish cages in Cabalitian Bay in the town of Sual, Pangasinan province.
Strong evidence
Bastes said she was surprised that the three foreigners were released “but as far as we are concerned, we have strong evidence against them.”
Statements made by the victims, four of them minors, would provide a strong piece of evidence against the foreigners, Bastes said.
The narration by the victims of their ordeal in the Sual fish farm “is enough for us to say we have a strong case,” she said.
Bastes said her office and groups supporting the campaign against human trafficking were getting sworn statements from 32 victims, all residents of the village of 96 in this city, which would be used to file human trafficking and child abuse cases against the foreigners.
Sworn statements
She said on Friday, social workers were to meet with the victims for their sworn statements and to file the criminal complaints at the city prosecutor’s office.
One of the victims, who asked not to be identified, said he and the other recruits would pursue criminal cases against the two Chinese and the Taiwanese.

“It was an experience not worth reliving,” said the victim, a 33-year-old job seeker.
“By pursuing our complaint, not only will we achieve justice but teach a lesson,” he said.
The provincial prosecutor’s office of Pangasinan based in Lingayen dismissed the human trafficking and child abuse cases.

Philippines,11186,manilastandard.net,2016-12-13T22:01:00Z,China to help in drug war,"CHINA is ready to give the Philippines weapons to help President Rodrigo Duterte wage his controversial war on drugs which has claimed over 5,000 lives, the Chinese ambassador to Manila said. Beijing has previously said it supports Duterte’s bloody crime war, which has been slammed by the United Nations and human rights watchdogs over alleged extrajudicial killings. Beijing and Manila have experienced a rapprochement since Duterte’s election in May, despite their conflicting territorial claims to the South China Sea. Ambassador Zhao Jianhua, in remarks late Monday, confirmed China was ready to supply the Philippines with weapons. “We’re exploring the possibilities of providing arms, light arms,” Zhao told reporters. “Arms for fighting against terrorism, [for the] anti-drug campaign.” The ambassador said talks were still in the initial stages, adding there was no agreement on price or the specific type of weapons, though they would most likely be rifles. Duterte, 71, won elections in a landslide on a pledge to kill tens of thousands of criminals to fight narco-politics in the Philippines. Since he took office the crackdown has claimed over 5,000 lives.The firebrand leader has also distanced the Philippines from longtime ally Washington, announcing his country’s “separation” from the United States on a visit to the Chinese capital in October. The Chinese ambassador noted bilateral relations were “good” and were “going to be better” still, “because your president paid a very fruitful and historic state visit to China.” Duterte has also hit out at US President Barack Obama and the State Department for criticism of his drug war. However, according to Manila, incoming US leader Donald Trump has taken a different tact from Obama, apparently praising the crackdown when he spoke to Duterte by phone this month. On Sunday, Duterte said China was ready to supply the Philippines with arms under generous terms. “It is a grant payable in 25 years so it is practically giving,” Duterte said in a speech. He recently canceled an order of about 27,000 assault rifles from the US after media reports that human rights concerns over his crime war would affect the delivery of the weapons.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'South China Basin'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Washington']}",transnational_organization_crime,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing']","['CHINA', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,2530,inquirer.net,2013-07-03T19:10:08Z,Filipina 5th Filipino drug mule to be put to death by China since 2011,"MANILA, Philippines – The execution of a Filipina drug mule in China was the fifth Filipino nationals put to death for drug trafficking since the execution of four Filipinos in 2011.
The 35-year-old Filipina was caught trying to smuggle around six kilograms of heroin in Hangzhou international airport last January 2011.
ADVERTISEMENT
She was executed Wednesday after the Supreme People’s Court of China upheld the death sentence handed down by lower courts on June 26.
Philippine President Benigno Aquino III had sent an appeal letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping to have the death sentence commuted to life imprisonment but the Chinese government did not respond.
Last March 30, 2011, Sally Ordinario-Villanueva, 32, Ramon Credo, 42, and Elizabeth Batain, 38, were executed in China also for attempting to smuggle heroin into the country.
A fifth Filipino was executed in December 2011.
They were arrested separately in 2008 for possession of at least four kilos of heroin each and were handed down the death sentence the following year.
The Philippine government appealed repeatedly to have their death sentences commuted to life imprisonment, but the Chinese government turned down the appeals.
Most executions in the world
The Dui Hua Foundation, a non-profit organization that advocates for the human rights of detainees, said in a report last December 12, 2011 that China conducted an estimated 4,000 executions in that year.
In an earlier study released in 2010, Dui Hua Foundation said that the number of executions carried out in China were higher.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Statistics on capital punishment in China are considered state secrets. Lacking official information, international observers are left to make educated guesses about the number of executions in China,” it said.
“In past years, Dui Hua has based estimates of annual executions on discussions with knowledgeable sources. We have estimated that China carried out nearly 5,000 executions in 2009—a slight decrease from 2008,” it said.
Dui Hua said in the same study that a separate research based on collated news reports of executions from October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2010 showed that there were at least 700 executions in China in 2009.
“After one year, ending on September 30, we recorded exactly 700 executions in China,” the study said.
“This number serves as an absolute minimum number of executions carried out over the year, and tells us nothing about how many actual executions may have taken place. But even using this lowest figure, China still executed more people than any other country in 2009,” it said.

Bureau of Immigration (BI) officers at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) have caught an alleged member of a big-time Chinese drug syndicate as he was attempting to flee the country.
In a report to Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente, BI Port Operations Chief Grifton Medina said 29-year-old Hong Liangyi was stopped Sunday night at the NAIA termimal 3 departure area before he could board a flight to Istanbul, Turkey en route to his final destination in Tehran, Iran.
Medina said Hong was barred from leaving after immigration officers found that he was in the BI’s hold departure list and was the subject of an arrest warrant due to criminal cases for illegal drugs that were filed against him before the courts in Cavite and Batangas.
“Authorities have identified him as a leading member of the Dragon Wu International Syndicate allegedly responsible for the production and distribution of illegal drugs in the country,” Medina said
The suspect was turned over to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Administration (PDEA).
It was learned that last January, Hong and two other Chinese drug suspects were issued a hold departure order (HDO) by the Tagaytay City regional trial court where the three aliens are respondents in a pending criminal case.
A separate drug case was also filed against Hong and 13 other drug suspects before the regional trial court in Rosario, Batangas.
Law enforcement agencies have tagged the Dragon Wu syndicate as behind the operations of several shabu laboratories that were discovered and raided in several places of the country.
Among these was the shabu laboratory that PDEA agents discovered inside a warehouse at a farm in Ibaan, Batangas on April last year and which resulted in the arrest of four Chinese suspects and four of their Filipino accomplices.
The syndicate was also pinpointed as the operator of a clandestine ecstasy laboratory that was raided in Malabon City on April last year.

The senator also pointed out that the Chinese government had previously informed the Philippines that it was opposed to the operations of Pogos, which cater mainly to citizens of mainland China.
“If we have a massive crackdown (on these Chinese Pogo workers), we will have a convergence of interests between the Philippines and China. They will be happy with it,” Pimentel said. —Marlon Ramos

Philippines,33462,manilastandard.net,2021-07-13T01:20:00Z,Ex-DFA chief: China helped Rody,"Former Foreign Secretary Albert Del Rosario disclosed Monday that China interfered in the 2016 national elections to help then presidential bet Rodrigo Duterte get elected. ""On February 22, 2019, we received information from a most reliable international entity that high officials from China are bragging that they had been able to influence the 2016 Philippine elections so that Duterte would be president,"" Del Rosario said in his speech during the online forum on the commemoration of the Philippines' legal victory in the arbitral tribunal against China over the maritime dispute in the South China Sea. ""We believe that our Beijing post can easily validate this. Moreover, subsequent actions of the President lend more credence to this information,"" Del Rosario added. When sought to provide more details, Del Rosario stressed that the information came from a “highly trustworthy"" source. But in Malacanang, Duterte's office described as ""nonsense"" del Rosario's suggestion that Beijing might have helped determine the outcome of a 2016 election that swept the Davao City mayor to the riverside Palace. Duterte's spokesperson Harry Roque, in his regular briefing, described Del Rosario's remarks as ""nonsense"" and called him a ""proven traitor"" before telling him to ""shut up."" Roque has accused Del Rosario, during his time as foreign secretary, of ceding control of the Scarborough Shoal to China. The Philippine and Chinese foreign ministries, China's embassy in Manila and the Philippine election commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Though Duterte is highly popular in the Philippines, his embrace of China and reluctance to criticize its foreign policy or maritime conduct has been controversial. The President has long maintained it was pointless and dangerous to challenge China. During the Aquino administration, Del Rosario initiated the filing of a case against China before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, the Netherland, which rendered a ruling in favor of the Philippines in July 12, 2016 that invalidated Beijing’s massive claims over the South China Sea and upheld Manila’s exclusive economic zone in the West Philippine Sea.After the election, Duterte set aside the arbitral ruling and warmed up relations with China in exchange for aid and investments while often criticizing US policies and castigating American criticisms of his administration’s anti-drugs campaign. Only in 2020 or four years after the ruling was handed down by the United Nations-backed arbitral tribunal that Duterte invoked the arbitral award against China in his address before the United Nations. Duterte declared before the UN General Assembly in September last year that the ruling was ""beyond compromise and beyond the reach of passing governments to dilute, diminish or abandon.”Duterte previously shelved the arbitration ruling when he assumed office in 2016 and has been criticized for his friendly overtures to China despite its aggressive actions and efforts to drive away Filipinos from its own waters in the West Philippine Sea. Several months later, Duterte, in a public address, dismissed the ruling as ""scrap of paper that is intended for the waste basket."" Despite conflicting pronouncements by Duterte on the sea disputes with China, the DFA said it would ""continue to implement the President's foreign policy statement in accordance with Philippine national interest."" ""As early as May 15, 2018, our President proudly declared in Casiguran Bay in Aurora that Chinese President Xi Jinping has sworn to protect him from moves that will result in his removal from office,"" Del Rosario said. In a 2018 press conference in Davao before going to China to attend the Boao Forum for Asia, Del Rosario said ""Duterte professed his undying love for the Chinese President."" ""It is certainly disturbing to see our President—who should be looking after his own people—relying on a foreign leader for his security of tenure as President. Moreover, such foreign leader represents an aggressor that is openly and illegally occupying land and waters that belong to the Filipino people,"" Del Rosario said. He also described Duterte's administration as a ""failure of leadership."" Since 2016, the country’s former top diplomat bewailed that the country's fight for the West Philippine Sea ""has lost momentum as Duterte decided to set aside the Award in favor of Beijing’s promise of economic benefits."" Del Rosario attributed this to Duterte's appeasement policy that appears to yield too much to China, saying such action is a betrayal of the Constitution, which mandates him “to secure the sovereignty of the State and the integrity of the national territory."" ""With less than a year left until the end of President Duterte’s term in June 2022, his record of asserting the rights of Filipinos in the West Philippine Sea has been abysmal,"" Del Rosario lamented. ""As President Duterte himself admitted in his State of the Nation Address in 2020 regarding the Chinese presence in the West Philippine Sea: “Talagang inutil ako dyan, walang magawa ['I'm really useless there and there’s nothing I can do],” he said.

Philippines,23999,mb.com.ph,2020-01-09T00:00:00Z,"Don’t read too much into election results, Taiwan tells China before vote – Manila Bulletin","By Reuters
TAIPEI – Beijing should not interpret Taiwan’s elections as representing a win or loss for China, Taiwan’s foreign minister said on Thursday, days ahead of a crucial vote overshadowed by Chinese efforts to get the island to accept its rule.
Taiwan holds presidential and parliamentary elections on Saturday. Its elections are always closely watched by China, which claims the island as its territory.
Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.
“I just don’t think China should read Taiwan’s election as its own victory or defeat,” Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters in Taipei. “If China reads too much into our election … there might be a likely scenario that China will engage in military intimidation or diplomatic isolation or using economic measures as punishment against Taiwan.”
President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election, has repeatedly warned Taiwan’s people to be wary of Chinese attempts to sway the election through disinformation or military intimidation, an accusation China denies.
Wu drew attention to China’s sailing of its new aircraft carrier into the sensitive Taiwan Strait late last year, calling the move a “clear” evidence of Beijing’s attempts to intimidate voters.
“This is our own election. This is not China’s election. It is Taiwanese people who go to the voting booth to make a judgment on which candidate or political party is better for them,” Wu said. “If China wants to play with democracies in other countries so much, maybe they can try with their own elections at some point.”
The issue of China has taken center stage in the campaign, especially after Chinese President Xi Jinping warned last year it could attack Taiwan, though said he’d prefer a peaceful “one country, two systems” formula to rule the island.
Taiwan-China ties have soured since Tsai took office in 2016, with China cutting off formal dialogue, flying bomber patrols around Taiwan, and whittling away at Taiwan’s diplomatic allies.
China suspects Tsai of pushing for the island’s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she will maintain the status quo but will defend Taiwan’s democracy and way of life.
In a front-page election advertisement in the mass-circulation Liberty Times on Thursday, Tsai appealed directly for people to cast their vote against China.
“In the face of China, every ballot has power,” the advertisement read, next to a picture of Tsai wearing a camouflaged military helmet and flak jacket.
Tsai’s main opponent is Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang party, which ruled China until 1949, when it was forced to flee to Taiwan after losing a civil war with the Communists.
Han says he would reset ties with Beijing to boost Taiwan’s economy, but not compromise on the island’s security or democratic way of life.
Overshadowing the elections have been allegations in Australian media from a self-professed Chinese spy about China’s efforts to influence Taiwan’s politics and support Han, who, along with Beijing, has denounced the accusations as lies.",1,,,"{'TWN': ['Taiwan', 'Taipei', 'Taiwan Strait'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'PHL': ['Manila']}",political_process_policy_intervention,"['China', 'Xi Jinping', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Xi Jinping', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Xi Jinping']","['Xi Jinping', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,16881,mb.com.ph,2018-06-29T11:53:42Z,Australia passes foreign meddling laws amid China tensions – Manila Bulletin,"By Agence France-Presse
New laws to curb meddling by foreign governments in Australia have been passed by parliament ahead of a raft of by-elections, amid heightened fears of Chinese interference in domestic politics.
Canberra last year announced plans to introduce sweeping reforms to espionage and foreign interference laws, with China singled out as a focus of concern.
Australia’s spy agency had raised worries that Beijing was interfering in local institutions and using the political donations system to gain access.
“Espionage and foreign interference pose significant risks to Australia’s security and defense,” the government said in a statement after the laws passed parliament late Thursday.
“Foreign adversaries are actively working against Australia’s interests through a variety of means, including obtaining classified information or seeking to influence the outcome of Australia’s democratic processes.”
The changes include strengthening existing spying offenses and new offenses that target covert, deceptive or threatening actions by foreign actors trying to influence or harm domestic politics.
People or entities who undertake activities on behalf of foreign interests will also be required to declare their links in a move designed to make the political system more transparent.
The legislation underwent numerous amendments after criticism from a range of institutions, including charities, that the reforms were too broad and could impinge on freedom of expression and public policy debate.
Attorney-General Christian Porter had pushed for the bills to be passed before several by-elections in late July.
“We have now something we didn’t plan for and that is in several weeks we will have five critical by-elections,” he told The Australian newspaper earlier this month.
“Even in the time that it has taken to consider the Espionage and Foreign Interference Bill, the threat environment has changed and become more acute.”
Four of the by-elections were triggered by sitting members stepping down after being caught up in a constitutional crisis concerning a once-obscure rule that bars dual citizens from federal office.

Philippines,1645,inquirer.net,2012-11-07T09:28:46Z,Eyes on the White House,"What bearing will results of the United States presidential elections have on its major ally, the Philippines?
“Whoever wins—whether it be Republican or Democrat—we will continue to work with the United States,” deputy presidential spokesperson Abigail Valte told reporters.
ADVERTISEMENT
Republican challenger Willard Mitt Romney and Democrat President Barack Obama were locked in a tight race on the eve of the elections that reminded watchers of the match between George W. Bush and Al Gore a dozen years ago.
Amid the US and our country’s Mutual Defense Treaty and longstanding economic relations, the government of President Benigno Aquino III is expected to continue counting on support from the White House, whoever sits there, especially with regard to claiming its share of the Spratlys amid China’s claim of the entire West Philippine Sea.
(Washington is expected to step up after the leaders of the European Union recently indicated support for President Aquino’s proposed diplomatic and law-based solution to the dispute.)
While the Aquino administration will continue to work through the issue diplomatically (apparently with some back channeling), some quarters could expect more firmness from Washington in supporting allies if Romney become its next occupant, the former Massachusetts governor having decried economic tactics from Beijing that he deems disadvantageous to the world market.
Meanwhile, the general reluctance of any Democratic presidential candidate to give jobs to immigrants or to move American companies abroad should not sully the Philippine government which under Aquino has promised consign to oblivion the Overseas Filipino Worker phenomenon and has made remarkable strides in improving domestic suitability to foreign investors.
The Philippine Reproductive Health bill could further lose steam in the event of a Romney win that would make US foreign policy more conservative and thereby averse to supporting financially or otherwise US-based movements to promote population reduction on the planet.
Relations between the two countries would go significantly farther if some stubborn kinks in history would be ironed out within the term of the next US President through the return to the country of the bells of Balangiga, Samar, which are rightfully the property of the Catholic Church in Samar, not war trophies, and the compensation of Filipinos who fought under the US flag during the Second World War.
A President Romney or President Obama can learn something of peacemaking from the Philippine government which is on the verge of definitively ending its problems with its Islamic constituency in Mindanao through the framework for the establishment of the Bangsamoro region.

Philippines,27577,inquirer.net,2020-07-20T13:00:29Z,China envoy warns vs US 'meddling' in SCS dispute,"MANILA, Philippines — Beijing’s top diplomat in Manila on Monday urged Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member-countries to be on “high alert” over what he claimed is the United States’ “intensified meddling” in the South China Sea dispute.
“While China and ASEAN countries (are) working very hard on managing the South China Sea issue, we have to be on high alert that the United States as an external force has also been intensifying its meddling in the South China Sea,” Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said in a recent interview with a local newspaper, a transcript of which was emailed to reporters on Monday.
ADVERTISEMENT
Huang’s pronouncement comes following a strong-worded statement from the US government rejecting nearly all of China’s claims in the SCS.
In what he branded as “distorting” remarks of two top US officials, Huang claimed that the US is attempting to “sow discord between China and other littoral countries.”
“It seems that the US is determined to translate the South China Sea issue from a pure territory and maritime dispute into a geopolitical game,” the Chinese envoy said.
Huang accused the US of “flexing muscles, stirring up tension and inciting confrontation in the region” under the pretext of preserving stability.
The Chinese envoy further said that under the pretext of endorsing rules, the US it is using the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to attack China while refusing to ratify the Convention itself.
“Under the pretext of upholding freedom of navigation and overflight, it is recklessly infringing on other countries’ territorial sea and airspace and throwing its weight around in every sea of the world… Against such a backdrop, I think China and its South East Asian neighbors should properly resolve disputes and prevent them from being capitalized on by the US to sabotage stability in the Asia-Pacific region,” he said.
Earlier, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. called as “non-negotiable” the historic ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in the Hague on July 12, 2016, which invalidated China’s expansive claims over the entire South China Sea.
The decision also upheld the Philippines’ rights over its 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) under the UNCLOS.
In response, the Chinese Embassy in Manila claimed that the PCA ruling was “illegal and invalid.”

Huang reiterated the embassy’s statement, saying that China’s position on the SCS issue has been “consistent and clear-cut.”
He said China “has always been committed to resolving disputes through negotiation and consultation with countries directly involved, managing differences through rules and mechanisms, and achieving win-win results through mutually beneficial cooperation.”
Huang said the situation in the SCS has “stabilized” due to the “joint efforts” of China and Asean countries, including the Philippines.
“China and ASEAN countries have agreed to conclude the COC (Code of Conduct) at an early date, a goal we are confident and determined to achieve,” he said.
“Once concluded, the COC will provide China and ASEAN countries a rule-based framework in managing the South China Sea issues, which will contribute greatly to trust-building, peace and stability in the region,” he added.
“No external interference can distract or sabotage our efforts,” the Chinese ambassador further said.

Trudeau stressed that official results had not yet been confirmed, but said the United States would work with whichever candidate emerges on top.
“Washington respects the choice of the Philippines’ people. We will gladly work with the leader they’ve selected,” she added, without being drawn on some of Duterte’s more controversial statements.
Duterte, who has vowed a fierce crackdown on crime and corruption, has made no secret of his involvement in running vigilante death squads as mayor of Davao and waged an incendiary campaign.
Duterte dominated campaign media coverage and generated international headlines with his relentless gutter talk, branding the pope a “son of a whore” and boasting repeatedly about his Viagra-fueled affairs.
He caused further disgust in diplomatic circles by joking about a raped Australian missionary who was killed in a 1989 Philippine prison riot.
Duterte was enraged when the US and Australian ambassadors criticized his comments and even threatened to break ties with Washington, one of the Philippines’ closest allies.
On Tuesday, he said it was up to US officials to repair relations with him and indicated that he was prepared to hold direct talks with Beijing over a sensitive territorial dispute in the South China Sea.
This, at least, did not cause offense.
“The United States has consistently expressed support for nations to exercise peaceful means to resolve territorial or maritime disputes without the use of force, intimidation or coercion,” Trudeau said.

Philippines,18149,inquirer.net,2018-10-13T05:14:37Z,‘Democrazy’ is alive in the country,"Democracy is in full bloom once again at the Commission on Elections (Comelec) where even wackos and weirdos are allowed to file certificates of candidacy for senator and other elective posts.
One of the “unconventional” candidates was Daniel Magtira, 57, of Tondo, Manila, who said that if he got elected as senator, he would promote Pinoy rock; that is, if “[he] would not be disqualified [again] by the Comelec.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Magtira claims he’s a former husband of television host Kris Aquino.
Anson Tuana, 39, will solve the traffic problem and inflation if he becomes senator. He claimed he once had a “one-night stand” with resigned Presidential Communications Assistant Secretary Mocha Uson.
Tuana told amused reporters he was “chummy-chummy” with Chinese President Xi Jinping who, he said, provided him with clothes and bodyguards.
Before he filed his certificate of candidacy, “King Salam” Emilio Delfin Lacan Luisong Tagean made an impassioned speech in which he vowed that the country would have its own astronauts and cosmonauts. He said they would be called “kinunot.”
King Salam comes from Bicol where one of the favorite dishes is kinunot—ground stingray cooked in coconut milk.
On the other hand, Benjamin Rivera, a refrigerator technician, filed his certificate of candidacy for Manila mayor. He has been running for mayor and president since 1998.
He reminds me of a guy named Tabije, a janitor-messenger at the National Press Club years ago whom some reporters urged to run for Manila mayor.
When the ballots were counted, Tabije got five votes, one from himself and the rest from the mischievous reporters who lived in Manila.
That’s why democracy—a government, as Abraham Lincoln said, of the people, by the people and for the people—is sometimes called “democrazy.”

During the 2012 standoff brokered by the United States, Del Rosario said the Philippines and China agreed to simultaneously pull out their ships from the area. He admitted the Philippines mistakenly believed China would keep its word and also withdraw their ships.
Roque enjoined lawyers to “study the legal liability of Albert del Rosario in ceding Scarborough Shoal to China.”
“Habang hindi ka makapagpakita ng teritoryo na binigay ng Presidente Duterte sa ibang bansa, manahimik ka diyan dahil eh ikaw nga ang may pananagutan diyan,” Roque went on.

Philippines,36860,mb.com.ph,2022-12-21T02:38:00Z,"China tells US to stop meddling following West PH Sea incidents involving Chinese vessels, coast guard","Sample subhead
With its vessels swarming the West Philippine Sea and its coast guard forcibly taking rocket debris from the Philippine Navy, China has made an accusation that it is the United States that is attempting to “stir up” troubles between China and the Philippines.
The Chinese Embassy in Manila on Tuesday issued a statement, urging the US “to stop using the South China Sea issue to stir up troubles, sow discord between China and the Philippines and undermine stability in the South China Sea.”
This came after US State Department spokesman Ned Price expressed the Western giant’s support for the Philippines in its call on China to respect international law following the two latest incidents in the West Philippine Sea, which raised the concern of several Philippine government officials.
China, through the embassy, also alleged that Price’s statement “contains unfounded accusations against China” that aims to drive a wedge between the two Asian countries, although it is not yet clarified which part is it.
“We strongly deplore and firmly oppose this,” the embassy said in a 286-word statement.
China also said that all parties having claims in the South China Sea have maintained “overall stability” and argued that “it is only natural for neighbors to have differences.”
In fact, it added, China and the Philippines “share the Asian wisdom of settling differences through dialogue and consultation” under the guidance of their state leaders.
China, in the statement, then alleged that “the US keeps meddling in the South China Sea disputes and trying to drive wedges between countries in the region, creating tensions and harming regional peace and stability.”
“What the US has done is not to help anyone but to serve its own geopolitical interests,” it also said.
The embassy maintained that China’s stand on the disputed water “is consistent and clear-cut” and that the peoples of China and the Philippines “have the will and capability to properly handle maritime disputes through friendly consultation.”
On December 19 (US time), Price said the US backs the Philippines in its call for China to “respect international law” through abiding by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) “and its legal obligations pursuant to the 2016 arbitral ruling.”
Price said the swarming of the Chinese vessels ”interfere[s] with the livelihoods of Philippine fishing communities, and also reflect continuing disregard for other South China Sea claimants and states lawfully operating in the region.”
”Furthermore, we share the Philippines’ concerns regarding the unsafe encounter that the PRC (People’s Republic of China) Coast Guard initiated with Philippines naval forces in the South China Sea, as documented before the Senate of the Philippines on December 14,” he added.
China earlier denied that it forcibly took the debris and said that it instead had a “friendly consultation” with the Philippine Navy.

Vice President Leni Robredo asked this question on Sunday, as she expressed alarm over Beijing’s potential role in the recently taken down Facebook propaganda network designed to drum up support for, among other things, a possible 2022 run by the President’s daughter and Davao Mayor Sara Duterte and China’s stakes in the West Philippine Sea maritime row.

Last week, Facebook revealed that it took down two disinformation networks: one with alleged links to the Philippine military and police, and another originating from Fujian, a province on the southeastern coast of China. Both were flagged for “coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB).”
Specifically, Facebook flagged them for potentially engaging in foreign or government interference, which is CIB conducted on behalf of a foreign or government actor.
The Fujian-run network consists of some 150 pages and was mostly focused on promoting Sara Duterte’s potential candidacy in 2022.
While modest in operations and not directly linked to the Chinese government, it was still the first public disclosure of Chinese efforts to influence Philippine elections.
“Why is China meddling in our domestic affairs?” Robredo asked during her Sunday weekly radio show. “We should be terrified of the implications of this. Why are they interested in our elections? Is this … because [interfering] would protect their own interests?”

BEIJING: The so-called British National Overseas (BNO) passport is not recognized by China, and Britain should stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs in any form, a foreign ministry spokesman said in Beijing on Friday.
It has been reported that Britain will in October put forward a new plan that would allow Hong Kong residents ages 18 or above and born on or after July 1, 1997, to apply for a relevant UK visa as long as one parent holds a BNO passport.
In response, spokesman Wang Wenbin told a news briefing that Britain's move fundamentally violates the promise it made in a relevant memorandum, openly interferes in Hong Kong affairs, grossly interferes in China's internal affairs, and violates international law and the basic norms governing international relations.
""China deplores and firmly rejects this,"" Wang said.
He stressed that the historical merits of the issue are very clear. Prior to Hong Kong's return to China, the British side made the explicit commitment that it would not confer the right of abode to Chinese citizens in Hong Kong who hold BNO travel documents.
But more than 20 years after Hong Kong's return to China, Britain has formulated its new policies for the BNO passport and is attempting to turn many Hong Kong residents into second-class British citizens.
China has announced that it will not recognize the BNO passport as a valid travel document or proof of identity, Wang said, and China urges Britain to immediately rectify its mistakes and cease meddling in Hong Kong affairs in any way.

Philippines,4890,inquirer.net,2014-09-20T02:53:22Z,China seeks to expand trade relations with Asean,"In what appears to be a bid to scale down tension in the region, China has proposed the establishment of a “Maritime Silk Road” with members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
Zhang Gaoli, first ranked vice premier of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China, made the proposal “based on good neighborliness and spirit of friendship,” during the recently concluded 11th China-Asean Expo (Caexpo).

In calling it the Maritime Silk Road, the Chinese official was making a reference to the ancient trade route that spanned two continents.
Some members of the Asean, including the Philippines and Vietnam, are currently embroiled in territorial disputes with China.
According to the Asean, China has stressed the need to further strengthen cross-border trade, boost subregional cooperation, and enhance people-to-people exchanges, among others, to “achieve greater peace, mutual development and prosperity in the region.”
The upgrade of the Asean-China free trade agreement was also cited as one of the essential foundations for the Regional Economic Comprehensive Partnership (RCEP)—a bigger trade agreement that will cover the 10 member states of the Asean and its six FTA partners: China, Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand.
o 18, showcased Asean merchandise including food, fruits and agro-based products, jewelry and ornaments, decorative items and wooden furniture. Education and healthcare services, as well as investment projects, were also exhibited to further enhance trade in services and investments between Asean member states and China.
The Philippines, through the Center for International Trade Exhibitions and Missions (Citem), showcased local goods such as arts and crafts, home décor, food products, fashion accessories and personal care products, all geared to attract consumers from China and the rest of the Asean.
Last year, Philippine manufacturers who took part in the trade event generated $3.78 million (roughly P166 million) in sales, with food and health and wellness products taking the lead, according to Citem.
“An estimated 100 million of China’s 1.34-billion population are now affluent enough to buy quality imported consumer goods. They have become more prosperous and now demand for more sophisticated products, with a greater emphasis on quality, convenience and freshness. Philippine exporters should capitalize on the opportunity to maximize exposure to the Chinese market,” Citem executive director Rosvi C. Gaetos earlier said.

Philippines,10354,inquirer.net,2016-10-22T00:10:18Z,"Tourism liftoff seen as Duterte, China clear air in trade ties","Commercial air travel between the Philippines and China is a potential winning sector given warming ties between the two nations, a move initiated by President Duterte’s pivot toward the Philippines’ second-largest trading partner, according to think tank Capa-Center for Aviation.
During Mr. Duterte’s state visit in China this week, his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed to lift the travel advisories imposed on the Philippines in the wake of a territorial dispute over parts of the South China Sea.
ADVERTISEMENT
“This will likely stimulate large air service growth between China and the Philippines,” Capa said in a report released Oct. 21.
The shift to China was seen as a gambit opening on the part of the President amid sovereign rights the Philippines holds over the contested islands.
“Travel warnings from China carry more weight than in other markets since state-owned/linked travel agencies essentially stop selling the impacted market. Diplomatic rows have resulted in drastic reductions in outbound passenger flows from China,” Capa said.
It said there was plenty of room for growth in the travel sector, considering the Philippines remained Asia’s smallest market for mainland Chinese tourists. It added the Philippines lured just 491,000 visitors from China, compared with comparatively smaller neighbors like Laos and Cambodia, which drew 511,000 and 695,000 visitors, respectively.
Capa noted that between 2013 and 2015, Chinese visitors to the Philippines grew 15 percent.
“Political tension reduced demand and would have been a factor in state-owned airlines growing to the Philippines, or Filipino airlines seeking slots in China,” Capa noted.
Manila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) accounted for six of the nine routes between China and the Philippines. Cebu has two routes (Chengdu and Xiamen) while Kalibo has one (from Beijing), the report said.
A big beneficiary to improving ties is Caticlan Airport near Boracay. The gateway, operated by San Miguel Corp., is finalizing its expansion that would allow it to accommodate larger aircraft.
“Chinese airlines might investigate what partnerships they could form for connections on the Manila-Caticlan route. This could help local airlines alleviate overcapacity,” Capa said.

Challenges to expansion still remain given congestion at Naia. The country’s busiest gateway handled 36.7 million passengers last year, well beyond its designed capacity.
“But with an opaque slot environment, there may be arrangements that mean Naia slots are made available to Chinese airlines, while Chinese slots are made available to Filipino airlines,” Capa said.

Philippines,12360,manilastandard.net,2017-04-29T00:01:00Z,Silk initiatives: 2 Sino provinces seek trade deals,"HAINAN, China—The southernmost provinces of Hainan and Guangdong have expressed their intention to establish strong relations with the Philippines to spur growth of their respective economies under China’s Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. Dai Zhen, deputy director-general of the Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs of Hainan province, said the provincial government was keen on stimulating growth and development with the Philippines, particularly in the area of trade and commerce, finance, agriculture, tourism and maritime transportation. The island province of Hainan and Guangdong are China’s two southernmost provinces and face the West Philippine Sea and the disputed islands of the South China Sea. Dai told a delegation of Filipino journalists invited by the Chinese Embassy in Manila to a six-day trip to Guangdong and Hinana that the provincial government also wanted to promote cultural and educational exchanges to foster people-to-people relations between the two countries. Dai said the Hainan government is upbeat because both Hainan and the Philippines have a lot in common. “In climate and geographic conditions, Hainan and the Philippines are similar too,” the official said. “Although Hainan is a young province, but we have cumulative experience in developing Hainan, so in this aspect I can say that Hainan and the Philippines can learn from each other,” the Hainan foreign affairs official said. She said Hainan already established “sisterhood” relations with Cebu in 1996 and Palawan in March this year. “We also hope to build cooperation in the area of tourism, as well as share experiences about the development of tourism industry,” Dai said, adding that she is also looking forward for the opening of a cruising terminal of its Sanya Phoenix Island and a direct flight of its local Hainan Airlines to and from the Philippines. Lou Jun, the deputy director general of the Foreign Affairs Office of the People’s Government of Guangdong, said the provincial government intends to build economic links with Manila because the Philippines is very closed geographically with Guangdong. Lou said that with China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative which promotes an “open policy,” Guangdong is now opening up its economy to foreign investors, as well as sharing its decades of experiences in transforming its economy, including the policies that they adopted to achieve its goals and economic growth. “China is still a developing country. But the improvements we got today is due to good policies implemented by the Chinese government for the last three decades,” he said. “We can share with you our experiences and achievements for the last three decades of developments. We believe that with hard work, with open-mindedness, and with sincere cooperation from other countries, a successful story can be made, just like what we have [here] today in Southern China,” he said.“Besides, financial support or physical support, we have just to implement good policies,” he said. Lou said Guandong desires to establish not only economic ties with the Philippines but also a stronger people-to-people bond. China has developed significantly in the last three decades, Lou said, pointing to its production of sophisticated products such as electronic gadgets and smart phones, or the operation of a high-speed train in Hainan province that travels at 250 kilometers an hour. “This only shows the progress. This only shows the development. This is not just something in the showcase, this is something in reality. People use that bullet train, people use that highways for their day-to-day transportation of the goods, the materials they produced and other products. So these kind of infrastructures, the improvements in the infrastructures you see will help people in the Philippines understand China,” Lou said. Yao Weizhi, deputy director general of Foreign Affairs Office of Shenzhen Municipal People’s Government, vowed to share with the Philippines how the city achieved dramatic economic growth and became a major gateway of international exchange and one of the most developed and internationalized cities in China, since it implemented the reform and a policy of opening up in the 1980s. Shenzhen, founded in 1979 and designated as Special Economic Zone one year later, has a land area of 1,996 square kilometers with permanent residents of 10.8 million. It is a coastal city in Guangdong, China, adjacent to Hong Kong. The city has compact air, land, and maritime transportation facilities, the largest number of ports in China, and the biggest cross-border flow of passengers and vehicles. Executives of Huawei Technologies., Ltd, in Shenzhen, revealed that it has already expressed intention to participate in the Philippines’ national broadband project. “We are already in talks with the Philippine government to improve broadband services in the country,” Wellington Liu Tao, head of public affairs and communications of Huawei Technologies Phils. Inc., told the eight-member delegation of Filipino journalists during a tour of its complex in Shenzhen. Liu Tao said Huawei Philippines has been working with Secretary Rodolfo Salalima of the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) for possible investments in the country’s broadband requirement. During a tour of its complex in Shenzhen, Yantian Port Group also conveyed its intention to operate and manage ports in the Philippines. YPG, an exclusive state-funded company, developed and managed the Yantian Port, the biggest port in China. “If the Central Government of China will allow us, we would be glad to operate and manage ports in the Philippines,” YPG’s chief engineer Mingjun Xiao told reporters through an interpreter.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Shenzhen', 'Yantian', 'Hainan Sheng', 'Guangdong Sheng', 'Guandong', 'South China Basin'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila', 'Cebu City', 'Province of Palawan'], 'HKG': ['Hong Kong'], 'NZL': ['Wellington']}",trade_agreement_exchange,['Hainan Airlines'],['Hainan Airlines'],"['Hainan Airlines', 'Guangdong']","['Guangdong', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Hainan Airlines']"
Philippines,2141,inquirer.net,2013-04-25T16:15:21Z,"China, 15 other Asian nations to start trade talks","BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei—China and 15 other Asia-Pacific nations will kick off the first round of free trade talks next month to create one of the world’s largest trading blocs, officials said Thursday.
The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is a rival pact to the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free trade initiative involving a dozen countries but that excludes China. Both the pacts underline competition between the US and China for influence in Asia.
ADVERTISEMENT
At the end of a two-day gathering in Brunei on Thursday, leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations said in a statement that negotiations on the comprehensive partnership will commence next month in Brunei “with a view to completing them by 2015.”
Negotiators from the 16 countries will meet for five days from May 9 in Brunei to outline the scope of talks in the areas of goods, services and investment.
The comprehensive partnership covers Thailand, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam plus that grouping’s six key trading partners — China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India. The Southeast Asian grouping of countries already has separate free trade pacts with the six nations.
Officials said the comprehensive free-trade pact, flagged by East Asian leaders at their summit in Cambodia just five months ago, was an expected outcome of efforts to merge various free trade agreements in the region to maximize the economic benefits.
With the bustling region of 3.3 billion people accounting for about a third of the world economy, a successful accord could significantly bolster trade and investment.
Some analysts said the complexity of the various trade agreements that need to be welded together means the comprehensive agreement will sacrifice an aggressive lowering of trade barriers to ensure a consensus is reached by the 2015 deadline.
It will have a narrower scope than the Trans-Pacific pact and doesn’t cover issues such as intellectual property rights, reform of state-owned enterprises or regulatory standards, said Sanchita Basu Das, economic researcher at Singapore’s Institute of Southeast Asian Studies.
“It will not be a gold-standard agreement,” she said.
Under the comprehensive pact’s guidelines, special and differential treatment is allowed for poorer nations such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. At the same time, flexibility clauses also allow members to drop trade policies with which they disagree and exclude sensitive industries from competition.
ADVERTISEMENT
While such flexibility makes it more attractive for developing nations to join the grouping, critics said it could also be a roadblock to greater integration and a handicap for countries unwilling to reform.
Seven of the comprehensive partnership members — Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand and Japan — are also involved in Trans-Pacific talks. Chile, Canada, Mexico, Peru and the United States are the other members in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of global GDP and about a third of world trade.
Negotiations on the Trans-Pacific pact began in 2005 and President Barack Obama’s administration has said it hopes to wrap up talks by the end of this year. The pact is crucial to the US as it seeks to reassert itself as an Asian and Pacific power, countering China.
Washington has only a handful of trade agreements in Asia, unlike China which has inked pacts with many countries and recently restarted three-way free trade talks with South Korea and Japan.
“America doesn’t want China in the TPP but rather than saying it outright, they crafted the agreement so deeply that they know the Chinese can’t do it,” said Simon Tay, who heads Singapore’s Institute of International Affairs. “At the moment, the regional comprehensive partnership is shallow, but healthy competition from the TPP can galvanize members to go a bit further to make it more meaningful.”

In a statement Tuesday, the Bureau of Customs (BOC) said officials from the Port of Davao and Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian recently visited a durian farm to discuss ways to help industry players in the export process for the product and boost overall agricultural export to China.
Port of Davao District Collector Erastus Sandino Austria also met with members of the Durian Industry Association of Davao on Oct. 28.

Philippines,18330,mb.com.ph,2018-10-12T11:35:16Z,Duterte to ask US not to exclude China in trade deals with PH,"By Genalyn Kabiling
President Duterte is planning to ask United States President Donald Trump not to apply an anti-China clause in a possible free trade agreement with the Philippines.
The President has expressed concern about reports that US trade deals with countries might include a provision prohibiting trade with China, saying such condition would limit the growth of the Philippines’ trading market.
“Now, here is a problem. I do not know if it is a confirmed move by the American government. President Trump would be willing to sign a trade pact with you… Now, kung pipirma ka niyan, you can export and import will continue but you cannot trade with China. Sige daw. Try to solve the problem,” he said during a press conference in Davao City early Friday morning.
“Si Trump, kaibigan ko. So kung magkita lang naman kami — kung magkita kami — sabihin ko, ‘Pareng Donald, ano ba namang… Huwag mong… Pati Pilipinas niyan. See we have a limited market suddenly. [Trump is my friend. When we see each other, I’ll tell him, ‘Donald, please don’t do it. The Philippines, see, we have a limited market suddenly],” he said.
The President recognized that the country has close relations with both the United States and China, apparently refusing to throw any of the nations under the bus.
China is currently the country’s biggest trading partner. The United States, on the other hand, has been a longtime economic and defense ally of the Philippines.
“Now, China buys everything from us. When I assumed the — my work as a — in the national government, everything was all right already. Maski anong ipagbili mo sa kanila, bibilihin nila. [They will buy anything we sell],” he said.
“Ang Amerikano naman, historically, may umbilical cord tayo, lalo na mga military, the police. They go there to train. So we have this brotherhood bond. So malapit rin tayo doon. [Historically, we have an umbilical cord with America especially the military and the police. They go there to train so we have this brotherhood bond. We are close to them],” he added.
Duterte said he got the information about the possible anti-China provision in the US trade pact from his economic team. Duterte, who came from a special gathering of Southeast Asian leaders in Indonesia, said “other countries were talking about it, having coffee.”
The President’s latest statement came following reports that the United States was prepared to add a “poison pill” in future trade agreements amid a tariff war with China.
The United States recently signed a trade pact with Canada and Mexico that allows the countries to pull out if any party enters a trade deal with a non-market country reportedly like China. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross reportedly said such “poison pill” provision in the recently completed North American trade deal could be replicated with other trading deals.

“Clearly, the economic and trade cooperation between our two countries is as good as it has ever been, better than it has ever been in fact. The main thing to focus on now, is on the implementation side,” Arroyo said during her keynote speech on the second day of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Manila Conference at the Shangri-La at the Fort, Manila hotel in Taguig City.

The former president-turned-Pampanga congresswoman also said bilateral ties between the two countries have reached new heights in recent years, which “have been evident in the jump in China’s investment in the Philippines and in China’s becoming the Philippines’ number one partner in trade and industry.”
Arroyo, who is a member of the BFA Board, also said the Philippines has to “exert maximum effort to remove on-the-ground bottlenecks that impede implementation of projects that involve trade and investment groups from China.”
“We hope that is the way your business plans will also end up. Welcome without restriction. We in the Philippines want to match your enthusiasm and this is what this Forum is all about. We want you to know the Philippine business climate… our business climate is very very welcoming for your business plans and I hope that will be the conclusion in this Boao Forum in Manila,” she continued.
The House leader again said China “has proven to be a partner in development” rather than a competitor.
“It is a market for Southeast Asia and its developing countries. It is a donor, it is a provider of capital and technology,” the lawmaker added.

Upon the initiative of Arroyo, the Philippines hosted the 2019 BOAO Forum for Asia Manila Conference, with the Federation of Filipino Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Inc. as its main partner, and the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry as supporting partner.
With the theme “Concerted Action for Common Development in the New Era,” the Boao Forum in Manila will seek to enlighten businessmen from China with regard to restrictions, according to Arroyo.
Arroyo’s praises came on the heels of criticisms that infrastructure loan deals between the Philippines and China would be “detrimental” to the country.

These loan agreements include the controversial $62-million Chico River Pump Irrigation Loan Agreement and $248 million New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam loan deal.
Makabayan senatorial candidate Neri Colmenares, however, said the Kaliwa Dam deal has “onerous conditions” that were “detrimental to the Filipino people.”
Meanwhile, Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio earlier said the Chico River Pump Irrigation project could potentially allow China to take the gas-rich Reed Bank (Recto Bank) in the West Philippine Sea if the Philippines fails to pay the $62-million loan.

Philippines,9867,inquirer.net,2016-09-05T16:34:43Z,"PH, China eye intensified trade, financial ties","MANILA — Despite a maritime dispute in the West Philippine Sea, the Philippines and China want closer trade and financial ties, according to the Department of Finance (DOF).
Specifically, the Philippine and Chinese governments would like to “revitalize” cooperation in five key areas: agricultural trade; bilateral financial cooperation through currency swap; customs; project financing; and tourism, the DOF said in a statement on Monday.

In a courtesy call to Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III last week, Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua also “offered Beijing’s support to the priority projects of the Duterte administration in the form of official development assistance for pipeline projects of the Departments of Public Works and Highways, Transportation, and Agriculture,” the DOF added.
In response, “Dominguez expressed his appreciation for the ambassador’s offer,” the DOF said.
Finance Undersecretary Maria Editha Z. Tan said the Chinese officials who met with Dominguez “strongly recognized the DOF’s role” in project financing, hence was “looking forward to participate in opportunities to support the administration’s agenda such as infrastructure projects.”
In relation to the Duterte administration’s aim to ramp up infrastructure spending, Chinese officials urged the DOF to fast-track work on the Philippines’ membership in the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
“The Chinese ambassador expressed appreciation that the Philippines is taking steps to complete procedures in its membership with the AIIB. The ambassador reiterated the need to complete all steps for full membership in the AIIB so Philippines can access project financing to support its infrastructure requirements,” Tan said. The Philippines’ AIIB membership has been pending as it still needs Senate ratification.
Also, Tan said the DOF and Chinese officials “agreed to revisit current currency swap arrangement to manage foreign exchange risks.”
In terms of project financing, the two sides would explore cooperation in the education, information technology, infrastructure, ports, power, technology and tourism sectors, Tan said.
In agriculture, Tan said “both sides exchanged views on growth potentials in the sector and shared opportunities where the countries can mutually gain benefits, such as the export of Chinese-made agricultural equipment appropriate to the Philippine setting, and expansion of Philippine exports to China such as tropical fruits (such as banana, coconut and pineapple) and high-end marine and fishery products such as lapu-lapu (grouper), bangus, tuna, crabs and shrimps.”
The DOF and Chinese officials also wanted intensified cross-border cooperation through customs, specifically by “addressing reported trade gaps, improving the exchange of information on import and export data, and curbing the entry of illegal drugs from China to the Philippines.”
During the meeting, Zhao “offered to assist in the joint development of tourist areas in the country and expressed interest in establishing the presence of Chinese hotel brands and chains in the country and increasing the number of Chinese tourist arrivals to the Philippines,” the DOF said. SFM

The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) opened its annual summit in Bangkok on Saturday hoping to secure a China-backed free trade pact at the three-day event, which knits together half the world’s population and around 40 percent of its commerce. For seven years the group has been wrangling over a deal spanning from India to New Zealand called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Though it is now seen as an urgent counterpoint to US protectionism, one senior trade delegate from the Philippines said a deal appeared unlikely before next year. Washington’s trade rumble with Beijing has weighed on markets, with the International Monetary Fund warning the spat could cut global growth to the lowest pace in more than a decade. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump’s protectionist rhetoric has spooked some Asean nations, which fear their economies could fall under his crosshairs. Trump has repeatedly warned of further intervention to protect US businesses, and several Asian nations are waiting to find out if Washington will place them on a watch list of “currency manipulators.” Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad warned that the regional bloc could hit back against any punitive trade measures, but he skirted over specifics. “We will do exactly what Trump does,” he told a business forum ahead of the summit opening, calling the US leader “not a very nice man.” “If you go alone, you will be bullied. We don’t want to go into trade war, but sometimes when they do things that are not nice to us, we have to be un-nice to them,” he added. Earlier, his Thai counterpart, Prayut Chan-O-Cha, echoed the theme of regional cooperation on the RCEP deal, while Philippines’ trade secretary Ramon Lopez said he hoped to have a “very positive report (on RCEP) come Monday” when the summit ends. But the treaty’s signing would happen only “within next year,” he added, with members meeting in February to sort out “pending issues on market access.” Separately, FIFA President Gianni Infantino signed a letter of intent with ASEAN leaders emphasizing a school program “to foster life skills and physical education” through football regionwide, the sport’s governing body said in a statement.India, whose Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also in Thailand, poses the greatest obstacle to RCEP in its current form. New Delhi fears opening key industries such as metals, textiles and dairy to cheaper Chinese imports. Indian intransigence has cast the deal —looping in the 10 Southeast Asian economies along with Japan, India, China, New Zealand and Australia—into doubt. “We want them (India) to be in. We want to have them... they are a big economy,” Lopez told reporters. Chinese premier Li Keqiang will attend the meeting as simmering tensions in the South China Sea also lead the agenda. China supports RCEP as a way to assert its trade dominance in its Asian backyard after Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in 2017. The Asean summit follows a push by Washington and Beijing for a partial agreement to squash some of the tit-for-tat tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods that have rattled both economies. But Washington has pared back its delegation to Bangkok this year. In what is being read by some as a snub to Asean, the United States is being represented by national security advisor Robert O’Brien and commerce chief Wilbur Ross. US Vice President Mike Pence attended last year’s Asean summit in Singapore, and Trump was at the 2017 meeting in the Philippines. A senior White House official rejected the notion of a snub, saying Trump and Pence are unavailable because they are “very engaged in campaigning” for a string of governors’ races. Trump trusts O’Brien “to go out and take care of big problems and small problems,” the official added.",0,,,"{'THA': ['Kingdom of Thailand', 'Bangkok', 'South China Sea'], 'IND': ['Republic of India', 'New Delhi'], 'NZL': ['New Zealand'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Washington'], 'JPN': ['Japan'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'AUS': ['Commonwealth of Australia'], 'SGP': ['Republic of Singapore']}",trade_agreement_exchange,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,10365,inquirer.net,2016-10-04T01:10:47Z,Russia eyed as new export market,"The “recalibrated” foreign policy of the Duterte administration seeking to foster closer ties with China and Russia would benefit the agriculture sector as the Philippines looks at new export destinations, Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III said Monday.
In a hearing of the Senate finance committee on the Department of Finance’s (DOF) proposed P21.3-billion budget for 2017, Dominguez said the administration’s foreign policy was recalibrated—not “changed”—such that the country would be more open to other markets.
ADVERTISEMENT
Dominguez said President Duterte wanted to strengthen and exploit opportunities with countries other than our traditional trading partners in line with plans to further open up the economy to more foreign investors.
“The recalibration of our foreign policy will open more opportunities for us,” the finance chief said, citing for instance that Russia was being considered as a new market for agricultural products.
Dominguez said Russia might become a new destination for Philippine bananas, among other tropical fruits and vegetables.
Dominguez added that the DOF would also deploy finance attachés to Beijing and Tokyo to firm up financial links with China and Japan.
The finance attaché to be posted in Beijing will also work to fast-track the Philippines’ membership in the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
National Treasurer Roberto B. Tan, who attended an AIIB meeting in Beijing last week as an observer pending the Philippines’ membership, told reporters that the Office of the President was already preparing to seek Senate ratification.
The attaché in China would also be tasked to find out why there was a gap in trade data of Chinese exports to the Philippines vis-á-vis Philippine imports from China, possibly due to underreporting or technical smuggling.
“We would like the attaché in China to work closely with the Bureau of Customs and the customs bureau in China to check each individual exporter there and see who are their consignees here,” Dominguez said, noting that the difference in values was almost 50 percent.

Philippines,20396,mb.com.ph,2019-04-06T11:09:46Z,"China-backed trade pact to be finalized this year, Southeast Asian official says","By Reuters
Southeast Asian countries engaged in talks on a major China-backed trade pact expect to finalize it this year, the finance minister of Thailand, which is the current chair of the 10-nation ASEAN grouping, said on Friday.
“The RCEP is very important for this area, especially at a time that protectionism is increasing in this world,” Apisak Tantivorawong said, referring to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) pact.
“I’ve heard that we will finalize by November this year,” he told a news conference, referring to the agreement.
He was speaking after a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Thailand’s northern province of Chiang Rai.
“Hopefully we can conclude by the end of the year,” added the grouping’s secretary general, Lim Jock Hoi.
Negotiations began in 2012 on RCEP, which envisions the creation of a free trade zone encompassing 45 percent of the world’s population and more than a third of its GDP but does not involve the United States.
In a joint statement, the grouping said it was committed to international trade and investment as key engines of growth and development.
“We reiterate our commitment to the pursuit of an integrated ASEAN to support economic growth and strengthen financial stability in the region amidst heightened uncertainties arising from trade tension and policy adjustments of advanced economies,” it said.

Philippines,9551,inquirer.net,2016-08-29T02:36:38Z,Expert: New China-backed trade route to benefit PH,"ONE OF China’s leading economists made a fresh pitch for closer economic ties with the Philippines and other neighbors in the region, while pushing forward an agenda for a new Silk Road that would revive ancient trade links between Asia, Russia and Europe.
Visiting Chinese professor Zhang Yuyan gave a talk in Manila on Thursday, promoting the “One Belt, One Road” plan that aims to implement a land-based and maritime-based Silk Road.
ADVERTISEMENT
Zhang, the director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, denied China has a hidden agenda behind the revival of this ancient trade route.
“There is huge, huge room for cooperation,” Zhang said. “The Philippines is an integral part of the ‘One Belt, One Road’ project.”
The Silk Road Economic Belt, first proposed by China’s president Xi Jinping in 2013, would bring together China, Central Asia, Russia and Europe (the Baltic), he said. What Zhang described as a 21st Maritime Silk Road was designed to run from China’s coast to Europe through the South China Sea (where the Philippines has a stake) and the Indian Ocean in one route and to the South Pacific in the other.
The talk, held at the Asian Institute of Management, came amid tensions after an international tribunal in the Hague, following a landmark case filed by the Philippines, rejected last month China’s historical claims in the South China Sea.
President Duterte said weeks ago the Philippines would insist that China respect the ruling, which Beijing described as a “political farce”.
Zhang said countries had a “common interest” in working together to combat risks to slowing global economic growth coming from high debt, low productivity and limited policy room.
He said the Philippines could benefit in various areas, such as infrastructure, tourism and agriculture.
“China is good at building and constructing. Seaports, airports, railways and roads,” Zhang said.

“Asia Pacific business leaders have expressed concern that, unless Apec [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] stays committed to meeting the Bogor Goals of free and open trade by 2020, accelerate infrastructure development and promote innovation, the growth and prosperity ambitions they share in the region would not be realized,” the Apec Business Advisory Council (ABAC) warned in a statement issued after its meeting in Seattle last week.

ABAC is in the thick of preparing the recommendations it will present at the Apec Summit to be held in Beijing, China, this November.
“It has been seven years since Apec leaders adopted our recommendation that Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP) would be the most effective means for achieving the Bogor Goals. It’s about time that Apec takes greater strategic leadership to bring the FTAAP into reality starting with a roadmap,” said Ning Gaoning, ABAC chair for 2014.
Gaoning said ABAC was “ready to be part of the process and provide business inputs” in FTAAP discussions.
ABAC also urged partnerships between Apec governments and the private sector to develop infrastructure.
Created in 1995, ABAC is considered as the “primary voice of business in Apec.” It is comprised of three business leaders each from Apec’s 21 member-economies.

Philippines,29199,inquirer.net,2020-11-12T17:27:04Z,Huge China-backed trade pact to be signed at Southeast Asian summit,"Fifteen Asia-Pacific nations are set to sign an enormous free trade deal at an online summit that started Thursday, with the pact seen as a coup for China in extending its influence across the region.
Once signed, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) will be the world’s largest trade pact in terms of GDP, according to analysts.
ADVERTISEMENT
The pact, which was first proposed in 2012 and viewed as a Chinese-led rival to a now-defunct US trade initiative, loops in 10 Southeast Asian economies along with China, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia.
“After eight years of negotiating with blood, sweat and tears, we have finally come to the moment where we will seal the RCEP Agreement this Sunday,” said Malaysia’s trade minister Mohamed Azmin Ali, ahead of the virtual meeting.
Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc also confirmed the pact would be signed this week during opening remarks at the online summit.
India had been due to sign the pact but pulled out last year over concerns about cheap Chinese goods entering the country, though it can join at a later date if it reverses its position.
The RCEP — whose members account for around 30 percent of global GDP — would be a “major positive step forward for trade and investment liberalization” in the region, said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at global business consultancy IHS Markit.
“RCEP will be the world’s biggest free trade area measured in terms of GDP,” he told AFP.
The pact’s expected signing comes as the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) fight to mitigate the crippling cost of the coronavirus, which has ravaged their economies and left many battling a severe public health crisis.
Thorny issues
The pact is also seen as a mechanism for China to draft the rules of Asia-Pacific trade, following years of US retreat under President Donald Trump.
“It certainly lends advantage to China’s geopolitical ambitions,” said Alexander Capri, a trade expert at the National University of Singapore Business School.
ADVERTISEMENT
But US President-elect Joe Biden may engage more actively with the region, Capri added, in much the same way as former President Barack Obama did.
“Think of the Biden administration as sort of a continuation of the Obama administration, certainly when it comes to the pivot to Asia,” he said.
While the region waits to see how its relationship with the US will unfold, it is battling several other thorny issues — including disputes over the South China Sea.
The flashpoint waters — claimed in their entirety by Beijing but also contested by Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan — will also be on the agenda at the summit.
But as several nations battle serious COVID-19 outbreaks, and with many promised priority access to Chinese-made vaccines, a stand against Beijing is seen as unlikely.
Instead, the focus will be on economic development in the bloc, with many of its tourism and export-reliant countries suffering badly.
“The road ahead is not a bed of roses,” said Vietnamese President Nguyen Phu Trong at the summit, warning that leaders would be expected to work together to control infections and support people who are suffering.
The RCEP could help ease the financial pain, said Kaewkamol Pitakdumrongkit, an assistant professor at the Centre of Multilateralism Studies in Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.
“In the light of COVID-19, RCEP could enable ASEAN to bounce back more quickly as such a deal allows firms to diversify their supply chains and increase resiliency of the regional economies,” she added.

Philippines,29379,mb.com.ph,2020-11-15T19:12:33Z,Asia Pacific nations sign the world’s biggest trade deal – Manila Bulletin,"HANOI, Vietnam — Asia Pacific nations including China, Japan, and South Korea yesterday signed the world’s largest regional free-trade agreement, encompassing nearly a third of the world’s population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP).Top officials from 15 nations that include Australia, New Zealand, and the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP — nearly a decade in the making — on the final day of the 37th ASEAN Summit hosted virtually by Vietnam.“The completion of negotiations is a strong message affirming ASEAN’s role in supporting the multilateral trade system,” Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said ahead of the virtual signing ceremony. The agreement will contribute to “developing supply chains that have been disrupted due to the pandemic as well as supporting economic recovery,” he said.Supporters of the trade pact, which covers 2.2 billion people with a combined GDP of $26.2 trillion, said it will bolster pandemic-weakened economies by reducing tariffs, strengthening supply chains with common rules of origin, and codifying new e-commerce rules.The benefits of the agreement include a tariff elimination of at least 92% on traded goods among participating countries, as well as stronger provisions to address non-tariff measures, and enhancements in areas such as online consumer and personal information protection, transparency and paperless trading, according to a statement issued on Sunday by Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry. It also includes simplified customs procedures while at least 65% of services sectors will be fully open with increased foreign shareholding limits.The RCEP “solidifies China’s broader regional geopolitical ambitions around the Belt and Road initiative,” said Alexander Capri, a trade expert at the National University of Singapore Business School, referring to Beijing’s signature investment project that envisions Chinese infrastructure and influence spanning the globe.“It’s sort of a complementary element.” But many of the signatories are battling severe coronavirus outbreaks and they are also hoping the RCEP will help mitigate the crippling economic cost of the illness.Indonesia recently tumbled into its first recession in two decades while the Philippine economy shrunk by 11.5 percent on-year in the latest quarter.“COVID has reminded the region of why trade matters and governments are more eager than ever to have positive economic growth,” said Deborah Elms, executive director of the Asian Trade Centre, a Singapore-based consultancy.“RCEP can help deliver it.”Negotiators pushed the deal across the finish line after India surprised participants late last year by quitting the agreement. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he pulled out over concerns about how RCEP would affect the livelihoods of Indians, particularly the most vulnerable. India, though, will be allowed to rejoin the trade pact.“The clause allowing India to join at a later date is symbolic and shows China’s desire to build economic bridges with the region’s third-largest economy,” said Shaun Roache, Asia Pacific chief economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings.Malaysia recognizes the difficulties India is facing, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said in a speech on Sunday.“Nevertheless, we wish to express our continuous support and welcome its accession to RCEP in the future.”Whether RCEP changes regional dynamics in favor of China depends on the US response, experts said. The agreement underscores how US President Donald Trump’s 2017 decision to withdraw from a different Asia Pacific trade pact — the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP — diminished America’s ability to offer a counterbalance to China’s growing regional economic influence.That challenge will shift to President-elect Joe Biden if, as expected, he’s officially named the winner of the Nov. 3 election. Still uncertain is how the Biden team will approach trade deals and whether it tries to re-enter the 11-nation TPP.The RCEP signing comes as Southeast Asian nations experience uneven recoveries from the coronavirus pandemic.Governments around the region have been negotiating travel lanes and bubbles in fits and starts as officials weigh health risks with economic needs. Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines are among those still dealing with elevated virus caseloads, while Singapore and Vietnam have so far successfully prevented new outbreaks.“The main benefit from RCEP will be to reduce costs across Asia Pacific supply chains and support the region’s dominance of the global trading system,” Roache said.",1,,,"{'VNM': ['Socialist Republic of Vietnam', 'Hanoi'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', ""Int'l Asia Pacific Convention""], 'JPN': ['Japan'], 'KOR': ['Republic of Korea'], 'AUS': ['Commonwealth of Australia'], 'NZL': ['New Zealand'], 'SGP': ['Republic of Singapore'], 'IND': ['Republic of India'], 'USA': ['United States'], 'MYS': ['Malaysia'], 'IDN': ['Republic of Indonesia'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Manila']}",trade_agreement_exchange,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Beijing']"

Philippines,10259,inquirer.net,2016-10-16T05:50:57Z,Less hostile media seen in friendlier ties with China,"Official media coverage between China and the Philippines could become less hostile, thanks to President Duterte’s new bilateral approach to the maritime conflict with China, newly designated Philippine Ambassador to China, Chito Sta. Romana, said.
Definitely, Duterte’s state visit to China from Oct. 19-21 is “pivotal,” Sta. Romana told the Inquirer in a short phone interview. “Immediately, it could change the tone of coverage of the Philippines (and make it) less hostile.”
ADVERTISEMENT
But Sta. Romana cautioned against expecting too much from the President’s first state visit to Beijing. “It’s just the beginning,” he said of the journey to build peace and stability in the region around the contested South China Sea.
Before Mr. Duterte’s declared shift toward friendlier ties with China, both Philippine and Chinese media and social networking sites were awash with racial slurs and cultural insults, with Filipino posts attacking China for being exploitative and greedy. Chinese media meanwhile dismissed the Philippines as a “childlike nation of maids and banana sellers” and a mere pawn of the United States.
Good reviews
A two-track approach being propounded now by both sides was to move forward on “noncontentious issues” such as cooperative ventures in business and development, while compartmentalizing “contentious issues” like conflicting territorial claims. Resolving these issues “cannot be done overnight. It will take time and will need listening on both sides,” Sta. Romana said.
Sta. Romana’s appointment, which has been getting good reviews in China’s media, would no doubt help these initiatives to ease tensions in the region. The China Daily quoted two senior researchers in Southeast Asian and Philippine studies as saying that the new envoy, “a China hand” and “a bridge” between the two countries “will help Manila better understand China’s policies” and “reduce misunderstanding.”
How Sta. Romana became a “China expert” is a unique and interesting story. The former college editor and student leader of De La Salle University was part of a student delegation to China in 1972. They were there when martial law was suddenly declared in the Philippines. Like many members of the delegation, Sta. Romana was identified with the Left and feared arrest upon return to the Philippines. His two-week tour thus unexpectedly turned into over three decades of residence in China.
During that time, Sta. Romana studied Mandarin and got a job as translator for a Chinese publishing house under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Those were difficult times for the students who battled homesickness and uncertainties during the tumultous years that saw the second half of the Cultural Revolution in China, the death of Mao Tse Tung in 1976, the fall of the so-called Gang of Four, the rise of Deng Xiaoping, and the beginnings of market liberalization.
Sta. Romana eventually made his way to the United States, where he earned a master’s degree in international relations in 1987. He returned to China in 1989 as a journalist for the American Broadcasting Corp. (ABC News), reporting on major events such as the Tiananmen Square protests and the developing crisis in US-China relations.

Retirement
After his retirement from ABC News in 2010, he returned to Manila to take up a lecturer’s post at the University of the Philippines’ Asian Center. He was president of the Philippine Association of Chinese Studies, comprised of the country’s leading China experts.
The offer to return to China, this time as ambassador, had come unexpectedly. Earlier, he had been asked to accompany former President Fidel Ramos in exploratory talks in China. Later, Mr. Duterte submitted his name to the Commission on Appointments (CA) as ambassador to China.
Of course he would accept, Sta. Romana said. “The President asked for my professional help and I will definitely offer him my best advice,” he said, adding “it was for the country … for the people.”
In next week’s China visit, however, he will not be beside the President as his appointment has yet to be approved by the CA and formalized via diplomatic protocols.
“I will be there but on the sidelines (and) on call,” he said. After all, this is a presidential visit and the big bosses—Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay and Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana—will themselves be coordinating the event.
But the incoming ambassador will be watching intently. How the visit goes will set the tone and framework for his job in the coming year—another unexpected and possibly tumultuous China journey for Sta. Romana.

Philippines,18540,inquirer.net,2018-11-25T17:08:04Z,Robredo slams Chinese Coast Guard's action vs Filipino TV news crew,"Vice President Leni Robredo on Sunday decried how members of the Chinese Coast Guard blocked a Filipino TV news crew from conducting interviews at Panatag Shoal.
During her weekly radio show, Robredo said the incident showed China’s “disrespect” for Filipinos despite the “Philippines’ landmark victory before the arbitral tribunal.”

“Nakakatakot na nakakagalit (Scary and offensive),” she said.
“Nakakalungkot kasi ito iyong pinapamukha sa atin: na talagang iyong mga dapat may karapatan naman tayo, inaangkin ng iba—inaangkin ng China (This is sad because we have rights. But what is ours is being claimed by China),” she added.

The footage of the incident aired on GMA-7’s Reporter’s Notebook was recorded on November 8, days before the two-day state visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to the country.
It shows that as the TV crew approached the shoal, two speed boats of the Chinese Coast Guard advanced towards the local fishing boat carrying the TV crew.
“Without the permission of China, you cannot carry out the interview here,” a smiling member of the Chinese Coast Guard told journalist Jun Veneracion.

Robredo slammed the “defeatist attitude” of the administration towards China’s intrusion in the country’s territory.
The vice president stressed the need for the government to “stand up to such treatment, especially in light of the arbitral ruling, which upheld Philippines’ rights over the West Philippine Sea.”

Robredo also warned that China’s claims over the area will not only affect the country’s sovereignty but the fishermen and their families who rely on the area for their livelihood.
“Noong nakaraan lang na mga araw, mayroong deklarasyon si Pangulo na sinasabi na, ‘Wala na tayong magagawa.’ Kapag iyong Pangulo na iyong nagsabi na wala nang magagawa, parang ginive up natin iyong pakikipaglaban,” she said.
(The other day, the President declared that we can’t do anything about it. If it is the President himself saying that there’s nothing we could do, that is tantamount to saying we have given up the fight.)
“Iyong mga irresponsible na mga comments galing sa Pangulo, galing sa spokesman, galing sa ating mga ibang officials, tantamount ito sa pagbebenta ng sovereignty natin. Kaya sana nag-iingat sa mga sinasabi, kasi iyong apektado dito, hindi lang tayo pero iyong mga henerasyon na susunod sa atin. Kasi iyong pagbuhay ng bawat Pilipino, nakataya dito,” she added.
(Those irresponsible comments coming from President, the spokesman, and other government officials are tantamount to selling our sovereignty. We should be careful about the statements we make because even the next generation will be affected.)
Robredo also questioned how the government could have easily given the disputed territory away, despite the country’s effort to uphold our claim in the area.
“Ang tanong, bakit ba interesado sila diyan? Dahil maraming makukuha na yaman. Bakit ba natin binibigay nang napakadali para sa kanila? Pinaglaban na natin ito nang legal,” she said.
(The question is why they are interested in that area? Because it is rich in natural resources. Why are we giving it away that easily? We have fought hard for this legally.) /ee

Hontiveros issued the statement on Wednesday, refuting the claim made by the Philippine Broadcasting System (PBS) that “Wow China” is an “educational program” and is “in no way whatsoever does it espouse or promote a particular political view or cause.”

The senator pointed out that in one episode in December, the program featured the chair of the Nationalist Filipinos Against Foreign Intervention as its guest, who said that the Philippine government should be “careful” in intervening in the Hong Kong protests, which was happening at the time, as China is a big trading partner.
In episodes aired on April 4, April 25, and May 9, the show included and detailed the aid that China has given to the Philippines in its fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
“The host of the May 9 episode even said: “Hindi tayo pinababayaan ng mga foreign neighbors natin especially ng China,” she said.
While the PBS revealed that it has agreements with United Kingdom’s BBC and Thailand’s Sawasdee on airing news about their countries, the opposition senator pointed out that these countries are not violating the Philippines’ “sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea.”
“Hindi tayo binubully ng mga bansang ito, hindi inaangkin ang mga islang tunay na atin,” Hontiveros said.
(These countries are not bullying us. They are not claiming islands that are ours.)
“It is infuriating that while our government continues to promote all that is well and good about China, albeit using Filipino taxpayers’ money, the Chinese government continues to destroy our reefs, establish new districts in our territory, and harass Filipino fishermen in our own seas,” she added.
“Wow China,” a collaboration of PBS and China Radio International, appears to be airing in the government radio station since mid-2018.

Facebook shuttered the pages and accounts for “coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB)” with sharing global news about the West Philippine Sea dispute.

One of the pages taken down was “South China Sea Outpost” which shared the news report about President Rodrigo Duterte’s remark that government will push through with projects under Chinese companies even those blacklisted by the United States.
Specifically, the Sangley Point International Airport, a joint project of blacklisted China company Communications Construction Co. Ltd. (CCCC) and Lucio Tan’s MacroAsia Corp.
Another post by a Facebook page “Solid Sarah Z Duterte 2022,” which backs Duterte-Carpio’s presidential bid in 2022, criticized Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon for opposing the proposal to give Duterte emergency powers to fix the problems hounding Philippine Health Insurance Corp.
Accounts traced to police, military
The social media giant also deleted over 100 counterfeit accounts that traced to the Armed Forces of the Philippines as well as the Philippine National Police for “CIB” or those with deceptive accounts.
Facebook said the accounts were mostly posting criticisms against “opposition, activism and communism.”
The accounts were most active when discussions on the anti-terrorism law started since 2019.
Here are some of the posts of accounts linked to police and military forces in the country:

Philippines,28507,inquirer.net,2020-09-23T03:15:01Z,"Facebook shuts down fake China-based accounts backing Duterte, Sara’s possible presidential bid","MANILA, Philippines — Social media giant Facebook has shut down several fake Facebook accounts and pages, the contents of which were supportive of President Rodrigo Duterte and the possible 2022 presidential bid of his daughter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio.
The fake accounts were traced to individuals from China’s Fujian province, Nathaniel Gleicher, head of Facebook security policy, said on Tuesday night.

According to Gleicher, the pages and accounts engaged in “coordinated inauthentic behavior” with their posting about global news and matters relating to the West Philippine Sea and operations of the United States Navy in three languages — Chinese, English, and Filipino.
Other contents include criticism of critical media site Rappler and other issues relating to overseas Filipino workers, known to mostly supportive of Duterte.
“They focus most of their activities on Southeast Asia. They posted in Chinese, in Filipino, and in English about global news and current events, including Beijing’s interest in the South China Sea, HongKong, contents supportive of President Duterte and Sara Duterte’s potential run in the 2022 presidential elections, criticism of Rappler, issues relevant to overseas Filipino Workers, praise and some criticism of China,” Gleicher revealed in an online press conference.
“We are attributing this to individuals operating from the Fujian province of China. In addition, it’s worth noting, as often when we conduct one of these takedowns, we’ve shared information about this with our industry colleagues and with researchers,” he added.
This is the first of two networks tracked down by Facebook, the other being a domestic cluster with ties to the law enforcement sector, particularly the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police.
Gleicher also said that, unlike in the local setup, the discovery of the network in China was a result of Facebook’s independent investigation and their proactive work to expose such operations.
Last March 2019, Gleicher also revealed over 200 Facebook accounts belonging to a network managed by Nic Gabunada, Duterte’s social media strategist in the 2016 presidential elections.
Previously, Gabunada also worked for then President Benigno Aquino III’s camp and network giant ABS-CBN.

Sara Duterte-Carpio has been rumored to be part of the administration party for the 2022 polls. Talks of a possible showdown with Vice President Leni Robredo, the acknowledged leader of the opposition, increased after they fielded a senatorial lineup in the 2019 senatorial elections.
Gleicher said more details on the report would be released later on, with samples of the posts from the China-based network.
But one thing is for sure, Gleicher said: All the accounts exhibited “coordinated inauthentic behavior” (CIB) and were engaged in deceptive methods.
“So for both of them, the central use of fake accounts, as you know, is a necessary condition for us to determine something is CIB. But that doesn’t mean it’s the only deceptive [practice] they engaged in,” he explained.
“So we regularly see these networks using pages that don’t fully disclose who’s behind them. The patterns of engagements that they may have with these accounts aren’t just the fact that they’re fake, but it’s how they use the accounts to boost their contents,” he added.

Philippines,27401,mb.com.ph,2020-06-10T12:47:06Z,"Facebook, Twitter, Google to report monthly on fake news fight, EU says – Manila Bulletin","By Reuters
BRUSSELS – Facebook (FB.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) should provide monthly reports on their fight against disinformation, two senior EU officials said on Wednesday as they called out Russia and China for their roles in the spread of fake news.
The comments by EU foreign policy head Josep Borrell and the European Commission’s Vice President for values and transparency Vera Jourova underscore the bloc’s concerns about the prevalence of misleading news on COVID-19 and the attempts by foreign actors to influence Europe.
“It really showed that disinformation does not only harm the health of our democracies, it also harms the health of our citizens. It can negatively impact the economy and undermine the response of the public authorities and therefore weaken the health measures,” Jourova told a news conference.
She said the next fake news front was vaccination, citing a study showing that Germans’ willingness to be vaccinated had fallen by 20 percentage points in two months.
The Commission said online platforms should provide monthly reports with details on their actions to promote authoritative content and to limit coronavirus disinformation and advertising related to it.
Jourova also said Chinese video app TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, will be joining the bloc’s voluntary code of conduct to combat fake news on its platform. Signatories to the code of conduct include Google, Facebook, Twitter and Mozilla.
Borrell described the fake news fight as involving warriors wielding keyboards rather than swords.
“Foreign actors and certain third countries, in particular Russia and China, have engaged in targeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally,” the Commission said.
The EU executive plans to counter foreign actors by stepping up its communication strategy and diplomacy, and provide more support to free and independent media, fact checkers and researchers.",0,,,"{'RUS': ['Russian Federation'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'PHL': ['Manila']}",media_campaign_intervention,['ByteDance'],['ByteDance'],['ByteDance'],"['China', 'ByteDance']"

The launching of China TV Theater, he said, coincides with the recent celebration of the 43rd anniversary of the establishment of China-Philippines diplomatic ties. “In more than four decades, our two great countries have witnessed robust friendship and growing partnership,” Zhao said. This development, he said, happened due to President Rodrigo Duterte’s successful state visit to China in October 2016. “Our bilateral relations have entered into a new era. We are now quickly translating our two leaders’ visions and consensus into ever deepening cooperation,” Zhao said. He noted that both countries are pursuing the “Three Pillars” of Beijing-Manila relations—political and security cooperation, economic and trade cooperation, and people-to-people exchanges. “The inauguration today of China TV Theatre will surely add fresh impetus to further build on the Third Pillar,” the Chinese envoy said.
Through the Chinese shows on PTV4, Zhao said Filipinos can now share to their fellow citizens the stories about how China became a fast-growing economy.“You could share the stories about how our reform and opening up in the past 40 years have helped realize a steady economic growth of China and better off the well-beings [sic] of its people,” the envoy said. “Reform and opening up really represented a strategic move to mobilize each and every Chinese striving for his or her personal happiness, for his or her family welfare, and for his or her national development. This is the Chinese Dream,” Zhao said. He also cited Duterte’s statement about every Filipino’s dream to have a comfortable life. “The Philippines has nurtured the dream of a comfortable life for her citizens, a society where there are opportunities for all. We are now slowly making the Filipino dream a reality,” Duterte said. Zhao said China will help the Philippines fulfill the Filipino dream. “Please stay assured, in this grand cause, [that] China was, is and will always be standing together with the Philippines as friend and partner, in realizing the dream of the Philippines,” he said. Zhao said he looks forward to China TV Theatre serving as a “grain of sand” for the Philippines that would “grasp a panoramic view of China and, more importantly, to get inspired in the joint endeavor.” This would “turn our dreams into realities, steady national economic growth, improved people’s livelihood, and secured regional peace and prosperity, while always bearing in mind that the key to the infinite future of China-Philippines partnership always lies in the palms of our hands,” he said.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Makati City']}",media_campaign_intervention,"['Chinese', 'Beijing']","['Beijing', 'Chinese']","['Chinese', 'Beijing']","['China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"

Young celebrities Iya Villania and Drew Arellano, brand ambassadors for WeChat, spoke on the virtues of WeChat’s new and exciting features in a press conference officially launching the popular application to the Philippine market.
“I think it’s amazing how WeChat makes it fun and easy not just to stay connected but to find and make new friends. With the feature called ‘Look Around’, WeChat locates other WeChat users in your area so that you can simply send them a message. And to make it twice as fun, you can use emoticons, send voice messages, video chat.”
Villania said: “We Filipinos love to share photos. Often, what we share with others is a reflection of how we feel at that particular point in time, and are expressions of our individuality. This is the reason I love WeChat’s ‘Moments’ feature which allows me to share photos, posts and online stories so easily from my mobile onto my social networking sites.”
“WeChat’s is our first commercial as a couple and we are so happy to be doing this for the brand,” said Villania of the brand’s new television commercial, revealed at the launch. “Download WeChat now and you can see yourselves how easy and fun it is to use.”

Philippines,29043,manilatimes.net,2020-10-31T00:18:37Z,Fake news ‘as deadly’ as Covid-19,"A veteran broadcast journalist warned that fake news and disinformation could be “as deadly” as the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).Speaking on Friday at The Manila Times’ online campus journalism forum, “Critical Thinking in Pursuit of Journalism Amid Critical Times,” former CNN Beijing correspondent Jaime FlorCruz said disinformation could “kill” and could cause fear and social unrest.NEXT GEN JOURNOS (First row from left to right) John Jayson Dalona of the Mindanao State University-Iligan Institute of Technology, former CNN Beijing correspondent Jaime FlorCruz, Katrina Gonzales of the University of Santo Tomas, Loynei Sumalinog of the University of Southern Mindanao, Manila Times President and CEO Dante ‘Klink’ Ang 2nd, Beatrice Quirante of the De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde, Richmond Viray, associate director of The Manila Times College, and Arlo Custodio, co-editor of the Times Campus Press section, during the online campus journalism forum held on Oct. 30, 2020. SCREENGRAB FROM FACEBOOK/YOUTUBE“Fear, disinformation and misinformation could be as deadly as the Covid [virus] itself,” he said.“That’s why we need good journalism; that’s why we need critical thinking; that’s why we need to support credible media groups; that’s why we have to pay for some of the journalism we consume; and that’s why we need top-rated journalism courses in schools.That’s why we give credit to the journalists who cover the news tenaciously and fearlessly because they are our frontline heroes, too.”FlorCruz, who was CNN’s Beijing correspondent for 14 years before retiring in 2015, said false news spreads further than the truth.“People do spread false news faster than truth because, well, it’s just human nature,” he said. “Nowadays, there’s a lack of rigorous fact-checking, especially on social media, and there’s an utter lack of critical thinking.”He also warned about “echo chambers,” which develops among people who have the same opinions and views agreeing with one another.“What happens when we rely on just one source, when we listen only to friends who share our views but no one else?” he said. “This leads to a clustering of like-minded individuals who think and speak the same way and sooner or later, they form what we call ‘echo chambers’. In it, they only hear their own voices, bouncing round and round. And because they only hear their own voices, they start to believe they must be correct.”FlorCruz said the readers must beware of echo chambers and open their eyes and ears to other points of view.“We live in a world where information is plentiful and understanding [is] just too little,” he said. “It’s one journalist’s role to fill that void. We must rely on journalists not just to rely on facts but to help us to make sense of our times.”As a correspondent in China, FlorCruz covered the SARS — severe acute respiratory syndrome — epidemic in 2003. SARS, like Covid-19, is a life-threatening respiratory illness caused by a different specific coronavirus.During the forum, five student-journalists across the country also gave their views on critical thinking.For Beatrice Quirante, acting editor-in-chief of De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde’s publication The Benildean, critical thinking in journalism as well as content provided by journalists are crucial.“What if journalism doesn’t involve critical thinking? Imagine how chaotic that would be. Fake news would be rampant; people would be sharing distorted information to one another,” she said.“There may be a widespread use of fake news and misinformation. People may start arguing simply based on gossip, presenting arguments with invalid points, which in turn promotes ignorance in society,” Quirante added.John Jayson Dael Dalona, acting associate editor of the Mindanao State University-Iligan Institute of Technology publication Silahis, considers fake news as the mortal enemy of young journalists.“In the call of journalism, we should pursue truth at all costs,” he said. “Therefore, critical thinking is significant for us journalists and even the readers to investigate information, identify facts from opinion, and make objective judgments.”Katrina Isabel Gonzales, associate editor of The Varsitarian, the official publication of the University of Santo Tomas, said journalism is not a mere occupation but is engagement in discourse.“We are not just doing an occupation, an enhancing scale or a hobby. It’s about letting the truth unfold especially at a time when the truth gets easily blurred out,” Gonzales said.“Being a journalist in a crucial time like this, we are able to show the public that the youth can also serve as the voice of the voiceless and show that we, too, have the knowledge and the courage to put ourselves out there,” she said.According to Loynei Sumalinog, editor in chief of the University of Southern Mindanao’s publication The Mindanao Tech, the start of the academic year was difficult for their publication, but their duties didn’t stop there.“Our responsibilities as campus journalists are very much needed in these times and so, we should do better and never neglect joining contacts like these,” Sumalinog said.The Manila Times’ Campus Press co-editor Arlo Custodio urged students to contribute articles to the section, which print edition appears every Thursday, to be heard.The Manila Times and The Manila Times College have also opened entries for the 2020 Campus Press Awards, in which entries from campus journalists that are published between January 2 to December 15 this year can be delivered to The Times.

Philippines,27248,manilastandard.net,2020-06-07T00:00:00Z,Congress to ban dual citizens from owning media firms,"A congressional leader on Friday asserted the power of Congress to regulate media ownership by banning dual citizens from owning any share in any media company to protect the national interest. Rep. Mike Defensor of Anakalusugan said the House hearings on the proposed fresh grant of a 25-year franchise to ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp. “have shown that allowing a Filipino who is at the same time a citizen of another country is inimical to national security and the nation’s interest.” “It is contrary to the provision of the Constitution that media should be 100-percent owned and managed by Filipinos or cooperatives or corporations wholly owned by Filipinos. It is against another provision of the Charter banning dual allegiance,” he said. The constitutional prohibitions have been highlighted in the hearings on the ABS-CBN franchise proposal because Eugenio Lopez lll, the network’s current chairman emeritus and previous chairman/president/general manager is a dual citizen - a Filipino and at the same time an American. Defensor, a vice chairman of one of the two hearing committees, recalled that the Department of Justice told them on Monday that Congress has the authority to flesh out the constitutional mandate on ownership of media by Filipinos. “I think the consensus is to do just that, so that dual citizens who certainly have allegiance to two countries would be prohibited from becoming media owners or shareholders. I, for one, will recommend or support legislation that would impose such prohibition,” he said. He said he would also initiate or support a proposal to implement the constitutional provision against dual allegiance. Defensor reiterated his example of a Filipino who is at the same time a citizen of China and who owns a newspaper or a television or radio station.“At this time when Manila and Beijing are involved in a bitter dispute over the West Philippine Sea, which side such a Filipino-Chinese take? Which country’s interest he would protect?” he asked. It is situations like this that the constitutional mandate on 100-percent Filipino ownership and another provision against dual allegiance intend to prevent, he said. In one hearing, deputy speaker and Cavite Rep. Crispin Remulla echoed Defensor’s arguments. To drive home his point against dual citizens as media owners and dual allegiance, Remulla reminded his colleagues that during the Philippine-American war, the Americans “killed 20 percent of our population.” For his part, Rep. Elpidio Barzaga Jr. of the lone district of Dasmariñas City in Cavite cited debates on the issues of dual citizenship and dual allegiance in the 1986 constitutional commission that drafted the present Constitution. Barzaga said the commission held the view that to resolve the question of dual allegiance, a dual citizen has to decide which of his two citizenships he would retain for good.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'PHL': ['Manila', 'Cavite']}",media_campaign_intervention,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing']
Philippines,39667,manilatimes.net,2023-12-14T00:15:00Z,Analyst warns of China's disinformation campaign,"Read this in The Manila Times digital edition.
CHINA might resort to an intensified disinformation campaign to push its claims in the disputed West Philippine Sea, a political science expert and analyst said on Wednesday.
""What is being done to us in the West Philippine Sea is part of an elaborate and long-term strategy of China for their narrative. If we look closely, this is part of what we call the grey zone tactics of China to enforce what they see is needed, like the firing of water cannons and laser pointing,"" said Dr. Sherwin Ona, an analyst and associate professor of political science and development studies at the De La Salle University, during the Bagong Pilipinas briefing.
Ona added that while China is flexing its military muscles to intimidate, it is unlikely to initiate a war.
He said its goal is to make it appear that it was the Philippines that was encroaching into its territory.
This handout photo taken and released on December 10, 2023 by the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) shows a China Coast Guard vessel (R) using water cannon against the M/L Kalayaan chartered supply boat (C) during a mission to deliver provisions at Second Thomas Shoal in disputed waters of the South China Sea. A Philippine boat was 'rammed' by a Chinese coast guard ship during a resupply mission on December 10, the Philippine coast guard said, in the latest such confrontation in the disputed South China Sea. The Philippine Coast Guard also said a Chinese ship 'water cannoned' three Philippine vessels involved in the resupply mission, causing 'serious engine damage' to one of the boats. Handout / Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) / AFP
""China will use its power, not just that of its military. We see their aggressive moves — with its militia and coast guard. But also in the background, they have this united front. They have their government and their private sector to push their pro-Beijing narrative to dominate their version of the story of what's happening in the West Philippine Sea. And they've been very aggressive in pushing it. Their making it appear that it is the Philippines encroaching in their territory. They're flipping the story,"" he said.

""We should also analyze their so-called 'playbook'. As much as possible, they would want armed conflict in the West Philippine Sea. Although we know they are capable of that, they are avoiding that. They are more after what is below the threshold of armed conflict; that's why they proliferating disinformation to convince the people, even Filipinos, and the international community that they are in the right,"" Ona added.
He said the best option for the Philippines right now is to ramp up its collaboration with other claimant countries, noting that such a step would show that violating the rights of the Philippines is also violating the rights of other nations relying on the West Philippine Sea.
""We have to show the community of nations that we are standing up (for our rights). Apart from that, we must also ramp up the modernization of the coast guard, of the navy, the armed forces, and most importantly, what we call the Whole-of-Society Approach,"" Ona said.
Meanwhile, a top US military leader on Tuesday vowed to provide vital information that would be useful to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in performing its missions in the West Philippine Sea, including the reprovisioning of its troops in BRP Sierra Madre.
""The US will continuously support the Philippines, not necessarily escorting our ships, but providing very vital information every time we conduct a resupply mission,"" Gen. Charles Brown Jr., chairman of the US Joint of Staff, told AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Romeo Brawner in a telephone conversation.
Brawner did not elaborate on the details of the intelligence the Americans will provide.
The two military leaders also discussed joint maritime patrols, the Enhance Defense Cooperation Agreement, and the upcoming 2024 Balitakan exercises.
""Well, for him (Brown), he is really disturbed by what is happening. They are closely watching the harassment of China, and in fact, they gave a statement of support not only to the armed forces but to the Philippines in general,"" Brawner said.
Besides the US, the Philippines has also conducted joint patrols with Canada, Japan and Australia in its territorial waters.
House probe sought over water cannon incident
The Makabayan bloc in the House of Representatives is pushing for a probe on the use of water cannons by the China Coast Guard's (CCG) against Philippine vessels early this month.
On Tuesday, ACT Teachers Party-list Rep. France Castro, Gabriela Women's Party Rep. Arlene Brosas, and Kabataan Party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel filed a resolution requesting the House Committee on Foreign Affairs to investigate the incident.
On December 10, the Philippine Coast Guard reported that the CCG water cannoned two of its vessels during a resupply mission to Ayungin Shoal.
It added that a CCG boat also rammed a Philippine vessel.
China claimed that it was the Philippine vessel that intentionally rammed into its boat.

However, this presupposes that the information being shared is correct and accurate.But even as the CHR lauded Facebook’s decision to take down these accounts, Dumpit said that it laments the social media giant’s failure to adopt a full rights-based approach to its policies.“The policy of Facebook should be anchored on human rights, the foremost of which in this case is the right to receive and impart information and the right to freedom of expression,” said Dumpit.Sadly, cyber militias and troll farms are drowning out legitimate dissent. Many individuals and organizations are wrongly being dubbed as “enemies of the people.”If there is one thing the Facebook investigation has proven, it’s that the country’s policymakers need to create laws against those individuals who continue to spread disinformation.“Apart from resorting solely to new laws, much of the work should be focused on improving digital literacy and critical thinking among internet users to reduce the impacts of disinformation,” stressed Dumpit.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing', 'South China Basin'], 'PHL': ['Manila'], 'HKG': ['Hong Kong']}",media_campaign_intervention,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing']
Philippines,4620,inquirer.net,2014-07-11T22:29:54Z,"Filipinos urged: Use Facebook to mobilize, especially vs China","MANILA, Philippines—Social media may be a tool to develop patriotism among Filipinos, especially at a crucial time that the Philippines is struggling with China’s aggressive claims in the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea).
“Facebook to me it’s the most effective social media site I think a lot of Filipinos use it. Over 90 percent of Filipino Internet users use Facebook to reach out to connect. I found out it’s a very effective tool for mobilizing,” Rafael Alunan, former Interior Secretary and co-convenor of West Philippine Sea Coalition, told reporters on Friday.

His group is maintaining Facebook pages to publicize China’s misinformation. The group held conferences and rallies to protest China’s assertiveness in the region. Another big protest is set later this July.
“All we can do in social media is keep on dishing out the truth the legal issue surrounding their claims can be countered,” Alunan said.
“What comes out on social media must be picked up by mass media. It’s mass media’s job to educate its audience. Part of it is monitoring whether such efforts or initiatives are taking root or not,” he also said.
China claims nearly the entire West Philippine Sea, including claims by neighboring countries within their exclusive economic zones.
“Their claim of the South China Sea is very fallacious. There is no factual basis for it. I call it a fairytale,” Alunan said.

Philippines,18513,inquirer.net,2018-11-23T08:19:32Z,China Coast Guard shoo away Filipino TV news crew from Panatag Shoal,"Members of the Chinese Coast Guard prevented a Filipino television news crew from conducting interviews in Panatag Shoal (Scarborough Shoal) in the West Philippine Sea (South China Sea) early November.
The incident, which was aired on GMA-7’s Reporter’s Notebook on Thursday night, was recorded last Nov. 8. It happened days before Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to the Philippines early this week.
ADVERTISEMENT
As the TV crew approached the shoal, two speed boats of the Chinese Coast Guard advanced towards the local fishing boat carrying the TV crew.
“Without the permission of China, you cannot carry out the interview here,” a smiling member of the Chinese Coast Guard told journalist Jun Veneracion.
While fishing activity was allowed, the Chinese officer said they were in the “sea area of the People’s Republic of China” and the Filipino crew needed permission from China to conduct interviews.
“But this is within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines,” Veneracion answered.
However, the Chinese Coast Guard personnel did not allow them to stay any longer: “If you don’t leave here, we will make a forced matter.”
Veneracion, while not agreeing with the Chinese Coast Guard personnel, chose to leave the area to defuse the tension: “You need not warn us, sir.”
“The crew of China Guard Guard didn’t leave the area until we were miles away from Panatag Shoal,” he said.
The report follows another incident shown by the same program in June 2018 about the Chinese Coast Guard confiscating the catch of Filipino fishermen in Panatag.
The shoal, located 125 nautical miles from Masinloc, Zambales, was a site of tense standoff in 2012 between the Philippine Navy and the Chinese Coast Guard. This incident prompted the Philippines to take China to international court.

In July 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague invalidated China’s sweeping claims in the South China Sea. It also ruled that Panatag Shoal is a common fishing ground for Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese.
President Rodrigo Duterte, who came to power weeks after the hard-won ruling was issued, has refused to use the victory as leverage over China in exchange for economic investments. /muf

Communications Secretary Martin Andanar expressed gratitude to the Chinese media for their fair coverage of the developments in the Philippines as the two countries sought to sustain cooperation in the media and communications industry.
Andanar made the statement following the courtesy visit of the China Media Group (CMG) at the Philippine Information Agency (PIA) headquarters in Quezon City Thursday.
In his statement, Andanar said he hopes to maintain the good relationship between China’s government-owned media outfits.
“The cooperation between the Philippines media and Chinese media escalated to levels that are unheard of,” he said.
“We hope that even with the departure of Ambassador Zhao [Jianhua], we can maintain the same good relationship,” Andanar added.
The former journo also expressed gratitude for the fair coverage of developments in the Philippines by CMG-member outlets such as China Central Television (CCTV), China Global Television Network (CGTN), and China Radio International (CRI).
“We are very grateful for the commitment of CMG. I experience very good coverage from CCTV, CRI, whenever I go [to] different parts of the world,” Andanar said.
Andanar also attributed the good coverage to the close relationship forged between the two countries under the Duterte administration.
“The relationships of the Philippines and China has elevated to a new level since President Duterte was elected into office,” he said.
Meanwhile, Huang Chuanfang, a member of its editorial board of the CMG editorial board, thanked the Philippine government for supporting their journalists when seeking requests for interviews, helping to give them a deeper understanding of local issues.

The PCOO currently has multiple bilateral agreements with the Chinese government with regards to the media and communications sector such as personnel exchanges, workshops, seminars, information exchanges, rebroadcasts, joint production, and mutual visits.
Huang was also looking forward to more exchanges in new media.

Philippines,22350,mb.com.ph,2019-09-12T16:22:28Z,AFP chief downplays spying concerns over partnership with Mislatel,"By Aaron Recuenco
Gen. Benjamin Madrigal, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), has downplayed concerns of espionage amid the military’s agreement with Mislatel to build its communications facilities in military camps and installations despite the telecom’s alleged ties with China.
Madrigal said that the agreement that the AFP made with Mislatel is the same agreement which they have with two other telecom giants in the Philippines –Smart Communications and Globe Telecom.
“We have been partnering of course with Globe, with Smart. This is the same partnership that we are doing with Mislatel who had been given or won (to operate the) third telco,” said Madrigal.
“We will give the same services that we have been giving to other companies,” he added.
Mislatel stands for Mindanao Islamic Telephone Company. It is a consortium composed of Chelsea Logistics and Infrastructure Holdings Corp., Udenna Corp, and China Telecom.
The Philippines is locked in a territorial dispute with China and other Southeast Asia countries in the West Philippine Sea. The Duterte administration is being criticized for its alleged soft stand with China amid tension between Filipino fishermen and Chinese Coast Guard and military in the West Philippine Sea.
Mislatel was conferred the status of New Major Player in the telecommunications industry by the National Telecommunications Commission on November 19 last year.
Based on the Memorandum of Agreement between the AFP and the Mislatel, the military will determine specific locations with its rental value for use of Mislatel in the installation and management of its communications sites.
On the other hand, it is Mislatel which will shoulder all the expenses and equipment necessary to effect the co-location of its facilities. The expenses include payment of all taxes, permits, licenses, and other charges.
“Payment will be made by providing CEIS equipment, upgrade, services, and training to the AFP equivalent to the monetary value of the lease subject to inflation,” an AFP press statement read.
Recently, security experts, including AFP and Department of National Defense (DND) insiders, raised the espionage issue over the locations of the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs) which happens to be near some military camps.
POGOs are known to be operated by Chinese businessmen, and have reportedly more than 200,000 Chinese employees.
The same concerns were raised over AFP and Mislatel’s memorandum of agreement with regard to the communication needs of the Philippine military.
But Madrigal assured that they have been exercising utmost security even with their partnership with other telecom companies.
On the part of Mislatel, it assured that it will not engage in any spying activities.
“Mislatel also ‘guarantees that the devices, equipment, and/or structures installed at the site provided by the AFP shall not be used to obtain classified information’ as a measure to prevent electronic espionage,” the AFP press statement read.
“We at Dito Telecommunity are truly grateful to the AFP for this partnership. The roll-out of Dito’s towers is indeed one herculean feat. With this partnership with the AFP, we are nearer our goal of building a wide and robust network,” said Dito’s President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Uy during the signing of the agreement.
For his part, Madrigal said they are more focused on the benefits that would be given by their partnerships with telecom companies to the AFP.
“Our MOA with other telcos significantly improved the ICT (Information and Communication Technology) infrastructure of the AFP and we are optimistic that this opportunity will also bring great benefits to the armed forces,” said Madrigal.
The MOA was signed on Wednesday at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City by Maj. Gen. Adrian Sanchez Jr, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications, Electronics, and Information Systems (CEIS), J6; and lawyer Adel Tamano, Chief Administrative Officer of Mislatel.
The MOA was subsequently endorsed by Madrigal as AFP Chief of Staff for the approval of Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana.",1,,,"{'None': ['Southeast Asia'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines', 'Quezon City', 'Mindanaw'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China']}",intelligence_counterintelligence,['China Telecom'],['China Telecom'],['China Telecom'],['China']

The CIA operatives were Stephen Stanek, Michael Perich, Jamie McCormick and Daniel Meeks. They sailed from Malaysia to a disputed area in the South China Sea in order to place an underwater “pod” disguised as a rock to monitor electronic signals of Chinese ships operating in the area.
But Tropical Storm Higos, known as Pablo in the Philippines, battered their 40-foot boat, which disappeared. They were declared missing and presumed dead. Their relatives did not know that they were spies, Yahoo reports.
Their mission near the Philippines was to dive down to place the disguised device, sail to Japan, then after a few weeks return to the dive site to retrieve the monitor.
The CIA secretly owned the vessel and the team’s cover story, backed by documents, was that they were delivering the boat to a client in Japan. They also used commercially-available scuba diving gear, instead U.S. government-issued equipment.
Tropical Storm Higos had been forecasted to veer away from the team’s location on September 28, 2008, so they went on with the mission. But Higos did not change course, dooming them.
The boat a CIA tracking beacon, which showed their vessel disappearing in the storm, a former member of the Special Activities Division (SAD) told Yahoo News. Japanese Self-Defense Forces swept the area at the CIA’s request, but nothing was found
Death certificates were issued with a lawyer hired by the CIA’s Panama City cover company, which registered the boat, filing the paperwork. The CIA brought the men’s relatives to its headquarters in Langley, Virginia to be informed of their ill-fated mission.
CIA officers blamed the SAD chief at the time, Bob Kandra, now retired, for the men’s deaths. He allegedly pressured the team to prove the usefulness of the agency’s Maritime Division in competition with the US Navy, a former officer told Yahoo News.
The CIA’s interest in the disputed area has remained. The Chinese Navy in 2016 found an American-made undersea drone floating in the ocean 50 miles off the coast of the Philippines. China agreed to hand the drone back, after the Pentagon said it was an unclassified system used to gather oceanographic data.",0,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'South China Basin'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'MYS': ['Malaysia'], 'JPN': ['Japan'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Virginia', 'Panama City', 'Langley']}",intelligence_counterintelligence,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

China claims almost the entire energy-rich waters, through which more than $5 trillion of maritime trade passes each year.
The Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan have overlapping claims.
The United States already operates P8s from Japan and the Philippines, and has conducted surveillance flights from Singapore’s neighbor, Malaysia.
Washington has criticized China’s building of artificial islands in the South China Sea’s disputed Spratly archipelago, and has conducted sea and air patrols near them recently.
Last month, US B-52 bombers flew near some of China’s artificial islands and at the end of October a US guided-missile destroyer sailed within 12 nautical miles of one of them.
In May, the Chinese Navy issued eight warnings to the crew of a US P8 that flew near the islands, according to CNN, which was aboard the aircraft.

Philippines,37392,manilatimes.net,2023-02-22T23:55:00Z,Chinese intel firm report: US military uses balloons to spy on China,"HIGH-altitude balloons are widely used for weather surveillance around the world, but the United States recently created a series of ""spying"" dramas hyping China's unmanned airship that went out of control, which not only built up tensions, but also seriously harmed China's rights through the use of force.
An exclusive report obtained by Beijing-run tabloid Global Times earlier this week shows that the US military frequently conducted close-in reconnaissance on China, including the use of balloons, making the US the top spying country in the world.
In 2022, the US military carried out close-in reconnaissance operations in the South China Sea over 600 times using spy planes, MizarVision, a Chinese technology and intelligence company, told the Global Times, citing open source Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data.

The real figure could be higher, as some US aircraft turn off their ADS-B trackers or use fake ones, MizarVision said.
Similar close-in reconnaissance sorties also took place in the East China Sea, including in August, when the People's Liberation Army (PLA) o China conducted large-scale exercises around Taiwan, according to the company's monitoring.
Frequently deployed aircraft include the EP-3E electronic signals reconnaissance plane, the P-8A maritime patrol and reconnaissance plane, the RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft, the E-8C airborne command and control plane and the U-2 high altitude reconnaissance plane, said the intelligence company.
The US military also uses other types of aircraft as well as vessels, and also disguises them as civilian airliners and commercial ships through fake identification codes and by customizing commercial aircraft into spy planes, MizarVision said, adding that such techniques have been used to spy on China's Hainan Island and Xisha Islands in the South China Sea.
The US military has also used spy balloons, including in an exercise with the Philippines in the Bashi Channel from March to April 2022. Made of polyethylene plastic, the balloon can be used for communications, navigation and remote sensing for more than 45 days at a time, according to MizarVision.
But it is a normal practice to use balloons for scientific research purposes.
The World Meteorological Organization last Friday said weather balloons had been a vital part of the global observation network over the past decades, serving as bases for weather forecasts and climate surveillance. Some 1,000 weather balloons carrying radio detectors send data every day.
Using high-altitude balloons for scientific research activities has become an international norm, with data from the China Science Daily showing that by 2018, the US had released more than 2,000 high altitude balloons, France around 3,000, and Japan more than 800.
With technological advances, balloon activities by scientific research organizations and companies around the world are becoming more frequent, which also makes cross-border flights more frequent, including those from the US. When such incidents happen, they are often solved through dialogues.
But this time, when China's civilian weather scientific research airship accidentally entered the US, it disregarded facts and China's friendly communication, took the chance for political manipulation and ill-intended hype, and accused China of using the balloon for ""spying"" purposes.
A source close to the Chinese military told the Global Times it was impossible that the Chinese balloon was used for ""high-altitude reconnaissance,"" as even Pentagon officials and US experts said satellites would do a better job than a balloon for military reconnaissance.
The source said that the current political atmosphere in the US does not respect professionalism and common sense, as it intentionally creates anti-China stunts.
The US is conducting so-called analyses on the balloon's payload, and these results could be faked to further throw mud at China, said the source.
Zhu Yaochun, deputy secretary-general of the China Air Transport Association, told the Global Times that the US' shooting down of the Chinese airship using a fighter jet and missile was an obvious overreaction and does not conform to international law and norms.
In international practice, civilian unmanned aircraft that accidentally enter another country's airspace should be escorted, warned, expelled or forced to land, as resolving a problem peacefully is a key principle of the United Nations Charter, Zhu said.
According to international law, the illegality of an unmanned aircraft entering another country's airspace without authorization can be exempted in the event of force majeure, danger or emergency evasion, Zhu pointed out.
By contrast, the US is conducting real military reconnaissance on China using technologies including balloons.
The purpose of this kind of close-in reconnaissance is to gather intelligence on the PLA's maritime activities, including those by nuclear-powered submarines, collect electronic information that could decipher the PLA's communications and grasp radar information, learn China's defense facilities by using optical and radar devices, as well as understand the PLA's warplane sortie patterns and reaction times, which serve the US' hegemonic aims, observers said.

SEOUL—A South Korean court on Tuesday sentenced the head of a traditional dance troupe to four years in prison after he was convicted of passing information to a North Korean spy. The Seoul Central District Court ruled that Jeon Shik-Ryeol, 44, had violated the national security law which bans South Korean citizens from making unauthorised contact with North Koreans. Jeon, the head of the traditional Korean dance company “Chool”, is a member of the left-wing Unified Progressive Party. Prosecutors said the dancer met a North Korean spy in Shanghai in March 2011, and sent an encoded oath of loyalty to Pyongyang a month later.He was also convicted of passing on details of a factional feud within his party in 2012. In February, Lee Seok-Ki, a legislator from the same left-wing party as Jeon, was sentenced to 12 years in prison after a rare treason trial saw him convicted of plotting an armed revolt in support of North Korea.

Philippines,38560,manilatimes.net,2023-08-16T00:19:00Z,Security council looks into Chinese 'spying',"THE National Security Council (NSC) is looking at possible espionage behind the China Coast Guard (CCG) using a water cannon to drive away a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) crew on a supply mission to the grounded BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) on Aug. 5, 2023.
NSC Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya on Tuesday said they suspect that some Chinese are targeting confidential information emanating from the Philippine military that detailed the mission.
""Yes, definitely that's one angle that is being looked at because it is a vital aspect of the Armed Forces operational security,"" Malaya said, adding that the CCG may have received information from an unidentified source who knew the route being taken by the PCG crew.
Two Philippine vessels were blocked by two Chinese boats a few miles before reaching the BRP Sierra Madre.
Malaya said they have made a critical assessment of the incident, leading them to eventually zero in on the spying angle.

""It's a primordial consideration for every nation to have good and effective intelligence. Of course, China has also satellites and several assets in the country, but for us, it's our responsibility as a nation to maintain operational security,"" he added.
Meanwhile, Malaya said the government's national security policy (NSP) has shifted to external security programs, prioritizing WPS issues.
""During the Duterte administration, our policy was focused mainly on internal security, concentrating more on terrorist groups. But with the waning of the CPP-NPA (Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army influence), the new NSP pertains to problems on the international level, external, and in particular the tensions in the West Philippine Sea,"" he added.
Malaya cited other issues, among them the Taiwan Straits, the nuclear proliferation in North Korea, and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
The new NSP is centered on strategic policies of the government pertaining to political stability, peace and public safety, economic development, national harmony, ecological balance and climate change, and cyber security, among others, he said.
Sen. Francis Joseph Escudero also on Tuesday said that he intends to propose P100 million in the 2024 national budget for the construction of ""permanent structures"" in Ayungin Shoal to strengthen the country's presence there.
The senator said the allocation will give President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ""budget cover should he decide to [undertake the construction] next year.""
""So, what will be given is the congressional authority to build more [structures] in the Ayungin [Shoal],"" Escudero added in a statement.
""I will propose the allocation of a minimum of P100 million to fund the construction of a pier and lodging structures for our soldiers assigned in the area and for our fishermen who might seek temporary refuge in times of bad weather,"" he said.
Under budget rules, the President can augment any item in the General Appropriations Act ""so he can increase the budget as he deems fit but subject to existing rules,"" the senator added.
He said the building of the structures has to be rushed because ""Sierra Madre's greatest enemy is nature, and it will soon be lost to the sea. Kinakalawang na (It's rusting already). Our soldiers should not die from tetanus.""
""Its being beached there was supposed to be an ad hoc measure. It is time for a permanent solution,"" Escudero said.
He pointed out that the appropriation is the best companion measure to the recently passed Senate resolution on the WPS, as the ""allocation makes it no longer a mere sense of the Senate resolution.""
""This proposal is not designed to anger China or bring us closer to the brink [of war]. This is just to give the President flexibility to act as the chief architect of our foreign policy as he deems fit,"" Escudero said.

BEIJING—A student in China has been detained for selling “intelligence” to foreigners for more than $32,000, state media said Wednesday in the country’s latest espionage accusation. The student, surnamed Chang, is an aerospace graduate student at Harbin University in northeast China’s Heilongjiang province, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Police on Tuesday authorized the arrest of Chang, who was found to have “gathered intelligence” for “foreign personnel” more than 50 times over nearly two years, according to Xinhua. The news agency said that Chang received more than 200,000 yuan ($32,000) in return. The nationality of the foreigners involved was not given.“The case reflects the fact that the ‘black hand’ of foreign intelligence agencies has been extended to college students,” Xinhua said. China regularly says it is a victim of espionage, but Beijing has stepped up the pace in recent weeks. On Tuesday, Chinese authorities announced that they are investigating a Canadian Christian couple for alleged espionage, a week after Ottawa accused Beijing of cyber-spying.

Philippines,22006,mb.com.ph,2019-08-18T13:10:20Z,Palace: Zhao’s assertion that PH possibly spying on China is just an opinion,"By Argyll Cyrus Geducos
Malacañang said that Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jianhua was just expressing an opinion when the latter said that China can also suspect that overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in their country are actually spies.
Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo made the statement after Zhao said that China can think the same way about OFWs there if Filipinos really suspect that Chinese workers in the Philippines are a threat to the country’s security.
In a radio interview, Panelo said that Zhao was only expressing an opinion about Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana’s concern about the presence of Chinese-manned Philippine offshore gaming operation (POGO) sites near military camps.
“Opinion lang ni Ambassador Zhao yun (That was just Ambassador Zhao’s opinion). Siguro (Perhaps), in response to the statement of the Secretary of National Defense. Kaya nga (That’s why) he was expressing an opinion and Secretary Lorenzana was also expressing an opinion,” he said.
“Hindi naman sa akin directed yun, eh. Sabi niya sabihin ko kay Secretary Delfin. Hindi ko pa nasasabi (It was not intended for me. He asked me to relay it to Secretary Lorenzana but I haven’t yet),” he added.
Panelo earlier said that he was invited by Zhao for a working dinner. However, the Palace official said Sunday that it was reset to another date.
Lorenzana earlier said that POGO workers could easily shift to spying activities, even suggesting that they are moved away from camps to hubs where they can be monitored by finance and immigration authorities.
The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) has proposed to move all POGOs to a hub. However, the Chinese embassy expressed concern that this can be considered as a violation of the rights of their workers in the Philippines.
In his interview, Panelo said that the Palace is okay with the idea as long as it will not violate the rights of the Chinese workers.
“Basta (As long as) it will not infringe or violate the rights of the Chinese workers. Kung makakatulong sa kanilang protection, wala kaming objection doon (If it will help in their protection, then we will not object),” he said.
Warships
Meanwhile, Panelo agreed with Lorenzana that the issue on Chinese warships passing through the Sibutu Strait has already become an irritant.
“It’s becoming an irritant if you keep on repeating certain acts that may be viewed to be in violation of the UNCLOS and not as an act of friendship between two countries,” he said.
According to Panelo, the government can “always file a diplomatic protest” and let China respond to it.
However, Panelo said that it will be up to President Duterte if he would discuss the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their upcoming bilateral meeting in China later this month.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines']}",intelligence_counterintelligence,['China'],['China'],['China'],"['China', 'Chinese']"

The flight included CNN International, which was able to witness the exchanges between the US and Chinese military.

“US military aircraft, this is China. Leave immediately and keep out to avoid any misunderstanding,” a voice said.
The US Navy crew responded with: “I am a sovereign immune United States naval aircraft conducting lawful military activities beyond the national airspace of any coastal state. In exercising these rights guaranteed by international law, I am operating with due regard for the rights and duties of all states.”
The US plane flew over four of China’s artificial islands — Fiery Cross, Subi Reef, Mischief Reef and Johnson Reef.
“What we saw [include] an incredible amount of infrastructure and development in the three years since CNN last boarded one of these planes and was able to fly through that area,” said CNN correspondent Ivan Watson in his report.
China claims most parts of the South China Sea, including waters close to the shores of the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam.
The ruling on a challenge brought by the Philippines, the UN-backed Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague invalidated China’s sweeping claim in July 2016.
But the Duterte administration set aside the ruling in exchange for economic opportunities and friendly ties with Beijing.
Early this year, the Inquirer published close-up surveillance images of China’s reclaimed features now equipped with runways, radar towers, missile shelters and other military facilities. The photos showed that the bases are almost operational and awaiting the deployment of personnel and aircraft.
China insists that the facilities on its man-made islands in the Spratlys are primarily for civilian purposes and they have “indisputable sovereignty” over the area. /jpv

Philippines,37314,mb.com.ph,2023-02-04T09:33:59Z,Blinken scraps rare China trip over alleged spy balloon,"WASHINGTON, United States -- US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday scrapped a rare Beijing trip aimed at easing escalating tensions between the two global powers, after the Pentagon said that China flew a spy balloon over the United States.
Moments before the decision, China issued a rare statement of regret and blamed winds for blowing over what it called a civilian airship.
But President Joe Biden's administration described it as a maneuverable ""surveillance balloon"" that was on Friday floating over the central United States.
With the rival Republican Party already on the offensive, Blinken postponed his two-day visit that would have started Sunday.
In a telephone call with senior Chinese official Wang Yi, Blinken said he ""made clear that the presence of this surveillance balloon in US airspace is a clear violation of US sovereignty and international law, that it's an irresponsible act.""
Blinken said, however, that he told Wang that ""the United States is committed to diplomatic engagement with China and that I plan to visit Beijing when conditions allow.""
""The first step is getting the surveillance asset out of our airspace. That's what we're focused on,"" Blinken told reporters.
Blinken would have been the first top US diplomat to visit China since October 2018, signaling a thaw following intense friction under former president Donald Trump.
Last month, Blinken said he would use the trip to help establish ""guardrails"" to prevent the relationship from escalating into all-out conflict.
Republican lawmakers quickly pounced on the balloon incident, casting Biden -- who has largely preserved and at times expanded Trump's hawkish policies on China -- as weak.
""President Biden should stop coddling and appeasing the Chinese communists. Bring the balloon down now and exploit its tech package, which could be an intelligence bonanza,"" tweeted Senator Tom Cotton, a prominent hardliner who had urged Blinken to call off his trip.
""Shoot down the balloon!"" added Donald Trump on his Truth Social media platform.
China voices regret
The Pentagon said Friday the balloon was heading eastwards over the central United States, adding it was not being shot down for safety reasons.
After initial hesitation, Beijing admitted ownership of the ""airship"" and said it veered off course due to wind.
""The airship is from China. It is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes,"" said the statement attributed to a foreign ministry spokesperson.
""The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure,"" it said, using the legal term for an act outside of human control.
""The Chinese side will continue communicating with the US side and properly handle this unexpected situation.""
A US defense official said earlier that Biden had asked for military options but that the Pentagon believed shooting the object down would put people on the ground at risk from debris.
The balloon has ""limited additive value from an intelligence collection perspective,"" the defense official told reporters on condition of anonymity.
The United States is also widely believed to spy on China, although generally with more advanced technology than balloons.
The northwestern United States is home to sensitive airbases and nuclear weapons in underground silos.
Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said Friday that the balloon was traveling at 60,000 feet (18,000 meters) -- far above the altitude used by commercial aircraft.
""We know that it's a surveillance balloon,"" he said. ""We're monitoring and reviewing options.""
Bracing for worst
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who was visiting the Philippines, held discussions with top Pentagon officials after the balloon was detected.
In the Philippines, Austin this week agreed to expand the US military presence, weeks after a separate troop deal with another regional ally, Japan.
The US military moves show that the United States is preparing for potential conflict over Taiwan, the self-governing democracy China claims as its own, despite diplomatic efforts.
Biden held a surprisingly cordial meeting in November with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a summit in Bali, where they agreed to send Blinken to Beijing.
A US military officer recently told his forces to be ready for war with China.
""I hope I am wrong. My gut tells me we will fight in 2025,"" Air Mobility Command chief General Mike Minihan wrote in a memo, saying that US elections in 2024 would also ""offer Xi a distracted America.""",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'USA': ['United States', 'Washington', 'Austin'], 'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'TWN': ['Taiwan'], 'CMR': ['Bali']}",intelligence_counterintelligence,"['China', 'Beijing']","['Wang Yi', 'Beijing', 'China']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Wang Yi']","['Wang Yi', 'China', 'Chinese', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,37316,mb.com.ph,2023-02-03T20:44:00Z,Pentagon says tracking Chinese spy balloon over US,"WASHINGTON, United States - The Pentagon said Thursday it was tracking a Chinese spy balloon flying high over the United States, just days ahead of a rare visit to Beijing by the top US diplomat.
After President Joe Biden requested military options, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and top military officials considered shooting the balloon down, a senior defense official told reporters Thursday.
But they decided doing so would endanger too many people on the ground, and because they assessed the balloon did not pose a threat to civilian aviation, the official said.
""Clearly, the intent of this balloon is for surveillance,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The official added that the balloon had flown over the northwest United States, where there are sensitive airbases and nuclear missiles in underground silos, but that the Pentagon did not believe it constituted a particularly dangerous intelligence threat.
""We assess that this balloon has limited additive value from an intelligence collection perspective,"" the official said.
The official added that there was ""no doubt"" the balloon was Chinese, without explaining why.
When asked about the US comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning warned against ""hyping up"" the issue and insisted China would not violate international law.
But she did not give a clear response on whether the balloon was Chinese.
""Verification is underway,"" Mao said.
The discovery of the aircraft comes just days before a scheduled visit to China by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, with managing heightened tensions between the two powers at the top of the agenda.
Blinken's visit to Beijing, which follows a meeting last November between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit, will be the first trip to the Asian country by the United States' top diplomat since 2018.
In addition to ongoing disputes over trade and intellectual property, relations between the two countries have frayed, particularly over democratically governed Taiwan, which China has pledged to reunite with the mainland.
The United States has been selling arms to Taiwan to defend itself, and Biden has said Washington would help protect the island if China attacked.
The State Department declined immediate comment on Thursday on whether the incident would scuttle Blinken's trip.
No military threat
The defense official said the balloon entered US airspace ""a couple days ago"" but that American intelligence had been tracking it well before that.
Austin, who was in the Philippines, held discussions Wednesday with top Pentagon officials after Biden asked about options for dealing with the balloon.
Fighter jets were flown to examine it while it was above Montana as discussions took place.
But the Pentagon decision was ""not to take kinetic action due to the risk to safety and security of people on the ground from the possible debris field,"" the official said.
Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder confirmed the balloon was still being tracked over US airspace.
""The balloon is currently traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic. It does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground,"" Ryder said in a statement.
Canada's defense department said late Thursday it was working with the United States to track a balloon, while signaling there could be other surveillance activities.
""Canadians are safe and Canada is taking steps to ensure the security of its airspace, including the monitoring of a potential second incident,"" the department said, without giving further details or mentioning China.
Beijing has sent surveillance balloons over the United States in the past.
However, this one has lingered in US airspace much longer, the senior US defense official said.
""We are taking steps nevertheless to protect against foreign intelligence collection of sensitive information,"" the official added.
Austin was in the Philippines this week to strengthen US defense cooperation, including gaining wider access for Pentagon forces at Philippine military bases, in a move that highlights the US view of China as a threat to East Asia.
The defense official said ""the seriousness of the issue"" with the balloon had been raised with Beijing officials.
""We have made clear we will do whatever is necessary to protect our people in our own land.""

Philippines,37293,manilastandard.net,2023-02-03T20:15:00Z,Pentagon tracking Chinese spy balloon,"The Pentagon said Thursday it was tracking a Chinese spy balloon flying high over the United States, reviving tensions between the two countries just days ahead of a rare visit to Beijing by the top US diplomat.
At President Joe Biden’s request, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and top military officials considered shooting the balloon down but decided doing so would endanger too many people on the ground, a senior defense official told reporters Thursday.
“Clearly, the intent of this balloon is for surveillance,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The official added that the balloon had flown over the northwest United States, where there are sensitive airbases and nuclear missiles in underground silos, but that the Pentagon did not believe it constituted a particularly dangerous intelligence threat.
“We assess that this balloon has limited additive value from an intelligence collection perspective,” the official said.

China said on Friday it was working to verify the facts around US claims that Beijing flew a spy balloon over its territory, warning against “hype” over the issue.
“Verification is under way” over the reports, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing, adding that “until the facts are clear, making conjectures and hyping up the issue will not help to properly resolve it.”
“China is a responsible country and always abides strictly by international law. We have no intention of violating the territory or airspace of any sovereign country,” she said.
“(We) hope that both sides will handle (the situation) with mutual calm and prudence,” she added.
The discovery of the aircraft comes just days before an expected visit to China by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, with managing heightened tensions between the two powers at the top of the agenda.
Blinken’s visit to Beijing, which follows a meeting last November between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit, will be the first trip to the Asian country by the United States’ top diplomat since 2018.
In addition to ongoing disputes over trade and intellectual property, relations between the two countries have frayed, particularly over democratically-governed Taiwan, which China has pledged to reunite with the mainland. AFP
The United States has been selling arms to Taiwan to defend itself, and Biden has said Washington would help protect the island if China attacked.
The defense official said that the balloon entered US airspace “a couple days ago,” but that American intelligence had been tracking it well before that.
Austin, who was in the Philippines, held discussions Wednesday with top Pentagon officials after Biden asked about options for dealing with the balloon.
Fighter jets were flown to examine it while it was above Montana as discussions took place.
But the Pentagon decision was “not to take kinetic action due to the risk to safety and security of people on the ground from the possible debris field,” the official said.
Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder confirmed the balloon was still being tracked over US airspace.
“The balloon is currently traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic. It does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground,” Ryder said in a statement.
Canada’s defense department said late Thursday it was working with the United States to track a balloon, while signaling there could be other surveillance activities.
“Canadians are safe and Canada is taking steps to ensure the security of its airspace, including the monitoring of a potential second incident,” the department said, without giving further details or mentioning China.
Beijing has sent surveillance balloons over the United States in the past.
However, this one has lingered in US airspace much longer, the senior US defense official said.
“We are taking steps nevertheless to protect against foreign intelligence collection of sensitive information,” the official said.
Austin was in the Philippines this week to strengthen US defense cooperation, including gaining wider access for Pentagon forces at Philippine military bases, in a move that highlights the US view of China as a threat to East Asia.
The defense official said “the seriousness of the issue” with the balloon had been raised with Beijing officials.
“We have made clear we will do whatever is necessary to protect our people in our own land.”
China offered no immediate comment on the issue.
Tensions over Taiwan reached a furor last year when Nancy Pelosi, then-speaker of the US House of Representatives, chose to visit the island.
After Republicans gained control of the chamber in January, questions have been raised over whether her successor will make a similar trip.
“China’s brazen disregard for US sovereignty is a destabilizing action that must be addressed, and President Biden cannot be silent,” current Speaker Kevin McCarthy tweeted Thursday evening.

Philippines,3948,inquirer.net,2014-04-29T05:16:58Z,AFP uses couriers to foil China spies,"MANILA, Philippines—The Armed Forces of the Philippines knows China is snooping on it so it has taken countermeasures to protect the country’s military secrets, though stopping short of adopting the Russian strategy of eschewing the Internet and clacking away on old but ever-reliable typewriters to communicate.
In AFP offices handling the Philippines’ territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea, cell phones are banned and there is no Internet connection. Communication is never sent by e-mail but printed out from computers and hand-delivered.
ADVERTISEMENT
For good measure, USB ports are not used.
Another countermeasure is speaking in codes or using difficult regional dialects instead of the national language or English.
The first time I met my source for this story, he asked me to keep my cell phone in my bag. The next time we met, he took my phone and put it on the table back side up.
Both were strategies intended to muffle the phone’s speaker.
Aside from foiling the eavesdroppers, the military is also on the lookout for traditional spies, the source said. Some pose as businessmen, vendors or even fishermen, he said.
Traditional spies and communication intercepts may have been used in the Chinese attempt to thwart the Philippine Navy’s resupply mission to the Marine garrison on Ayungin Shoal (Second Thomas Shoal) in the West Philippine Sea on March 29.
Mission ‘compromised’
That mission was “compromised,” as there were telltale signs of intercepted communication and traditional spies on the ground, the source said.
“Had the US Navy planes not made low passes over your ship and the Sierra Madre, the China Coast Guard could have been more aggressive in blocking you and kept you from getting to Ayungin Shoal,” the source said, requesting anonymity for lack of authority to talk to reporters about military operational details.
ADVERTISEMENT
The government fisheries vessel manned by Navy sailors traveled more than 36 hours to Ayungin Shoal to bring a fresh team of Marines to replace the garrison on the BRP Sierra Madre, food supplies and other necessities to sustain the troops for their three-month tour of duty.
The mission also included me and other journalists who were invited by the AFP in an effort to “publicize and internationalize” China’s bullying in the West Philippine Sea, the part of the South China Sea within the Philippines’ 370-kilometer exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
It was the first time that the military took journalists on a delicate mission, a deviation from its policy of silence on the territorial dispute and instead referring reporters to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).
Overdue rotation
The March 29 mission was imperative because the garrison on the Sierra Madre had been there for nearly five months, way beyond the usual tour of duty at Ayungin Shoal where the government grounded the rusting vessel in 1999 to mark Philippine territory after China seized Mischief Reef (Panganiban Reef) in 1995.
The China Coast Guard had blocked other resupply missions, limiting the military to aerial drops to resupply the Sierra Madre garrison.
The Inquirer source said three days before the Ayungin mission, an area off Palawan province that the Navy maintains for operations on the Spratly Islands lost all its communication signals, from cell phones to the Internet, even if there were no disruptions at all on the mainland.
The military knows, almost by instinct, who is intercepting the signals after nearly two years of heightened tensions with China over disputed territories in the West Philippine Sea.
“We knew the mission was compromised,” the source said.
Also monitored patrolling the disputed territory were four China Coast Guard vessels and two China Navy ships about 18 kilometers away from Ayungin Shoal.
Target vessel
The Chinese also knew which vessel to block, the source said. There were other fishing boats in the area around the time of the mission, but the China Coast Guard did not harass those vessels.
“They knew that your vessel was the one that left the military’s jump-off point. We surmised that they were actually waiting for two Philippine ships, that was why only the CCG (China Coast Guard vessel) 3401 blocked you. It seemed that the other Coast Guard ship was waiting for the other Philippine vessel,” the source said.
The “other Philippine vessel” did not make it to Ayungin Shoal. Halfway through the journey, the shaft of the MV Unnaizah May broke, practically disabling the vessel. The MV Unnaizah May was the resupply vessel that the Chinese Coast Guard chased away on March 9.
The source also said that the “spike in physical and electronic activities” whenever there is a scheduled resupply or troop rotation mission likewise alerts China.
A country spending billions of dollars on defense and security could very well have the most advanced technology for eavesdropping on its rivals for territory in the South China Sea.
Potent countermeasure
But the US Navy aircraft that appeared to be P-8 Poseidons were perhaps the most potent countermeasure against China.
A Navy officer manning the fisheries vessel of the resupply mission said in an interview with ABS-CBN that he found the presence of the Poseidons comforting, knowing they were “our friends.”
Journalists on the Ayungin mission had reason to believe that the Philippine military worked with the US Pacific Command for the March 29 run to the Sierra Madre.
While no one from the military would confirm this, Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Cuisia was quoted in news reports earlier this month as saying the United States helped in the Ayungin mission. Cuisia, however, did not give details.
Matching interests
The Inquirer source said the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) signed Monday by the Philippines and the United States showed how “countries behave just like people.”
“People have personal interests. Countries have national interests. It is the national interest of the US to keep the status quo in the region. And we have to protect what is ours. Our interests simply match,” the source said.

Pagasa: ‘Amihan’ surge to bring cooler weather until next weekThe Pentagon said Thursday it was tracking the balloon which flew far above the western state of Montana and decided for safety reasons not to shoot it down.After initial hesitation, Beijing admitted ownership of the “airship” and said it veered off course due to the winds.“The airship is from China. It is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes,” said the statement attributed to a foreign ministry spokesperson.“The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into US airspace due to force majeure,” it said, using the legal term for an act outside of human control.“The Chinese side will continue communicating with the US side and properly handle this unexpected situation.”Republican lawmakers quickly pounced on the incident, casting President Joe Biden — who has largely preserved and at times expanded his Republican predecessor Donald Trump’s hawkish policies on China — as weak.A senior defense official said that Biden had asked for military options but that the Pentagon believed shooting the object down would put people on the ground at risk from debris.The balloon has “limited additive value from an intelligence collection perspective,” the official told reporters on condition of anonymity.But the official said it was clearly a balloon meant for surveillance.The United States is also widely believed to spy on China, although generally with more advanced technology than balloons.The northwestern United States is home to sensitive airbases and nuclear weapons in underground silos.The Pentagon said that fighter jets were flown to examine the balloon. Canada also said it had tracked the balloon.Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said that, as of Thursday, the balloon was “traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic.”“It does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground,” Ryder said in a statement.Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who was visiting the Philippines, held discussions Wednesday with top Pentagon officials after Biden asked for options, the defense official said.In the Philippines, Austin agreed to expand the US military presence, weeks after a separate troop deal with another regional ally, Japan.The US military moves show that the United States is preparing for potential conflict over Taiwan, the self-governing democracy China claims as its own, despite diplomatic efforts.Biden held a surprisingly cordial meeting in November with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a summit in Bali, where they agreed to send Blinken to Beijing.Blinken had described China as a leading competitor but said last month that his trip was intended to set “guardrails” to prevent tensions from escalating into conflict.A senior US military officer recently told his forces to be ready for war with China after Taiwan’s elections next year.“I hope I am wrong. My gut tells me we will fight in 2025,” Air Mobility Command chief General Mike Minihan wrote in a memo, saying that US elections in 2024 would also “offer Xi a distracted America.”Blinken has said that Xi has been speeding up his timeframe to “reunify” with Taiwan, to which the United States sells weapons.But Austin, while accusing China of trying to “establish a new normal” on Taiwan, said last month he doubted an invasion is “imminent.”Subscribe to our daily newsletterBy providing an email address.

BAGUIO CITY – “Through thick and thin, the Filipino-Chinese community has steadfastly stood by the city and can always be relied on in good times and bad.”
Mayor Benjamin Magalong made this assertion in his message during the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) launch at the Baguio City Hall grounds conducted by the city government and the Baguio Filipino-Chinese community.
Magalong thanked the Chinoys for unselfishly contributing their time, talent and treasure in achieving a better Baguio and a better life for everyone.
He also revealed that the Baguio-Filipino Chinese community will be constructing a pagoda and will be rehabilitating the nursery at the Botanical Garden.
“May the special relationship with our brothers and sisters of the Filipino-Chinese community continue for many years to come,” Magalong stressed.
Festival chairman Peter Ng, said the celebration aims to strengthen the historic cooperation, amity and unity between the various ethnicities of the city and the Filipino-Chinese community.
This being the Year of the Metal Rat, Filipino-Chinese artist Chino Chow explained that since it was the first animal in the 12 animal Chinese Astrology, 2020 is considered a year of new beginning and renewals.

Philippines,34683,mb.com.ph,2021-12-05T00:00:00Z,Record low turnout for Hong Kong's first 'patriots only' polls,"HONG KONG, China — Hong Kongers turned out in historically low numbers to pick lawmakers under China’s new “patriots only” rules that dramatically cut directly elected seats, official results showed Monday, in a stinging rebuke to Beijing.
AFP/ MANILA BULLETIN
Figures showed just 30 percent of the electorate cast ballots, the lowest rate both of the period since the city’s 1997 handover to China and the British colonial era. It was the first legislature poll under a new political blueprint China imposed on Hong Kong in response to massive and often violent pro-democracy protests two years ago.
Beijing has responded with a sweeping national security law that criminalises much dissent and political reforms to remove anyone deemed unpatriotic.
But in the first public test of the new system, most Hong Kongers stayed away from polling stations, taking advantage of free public transport for the day to fill shopping malls, hiking trails and beaches instead. Authorities recently made it illegal to organise or incite voting boycotts but many prominent democracy activists who have fled overseas issued such calls on social media. Kenneth Chan, a political scientist at Hong Kong’s Baptist University, described Sunday’s turnout as “hugely embarrassing” for the government.
“Most pro-democracy voters decided to stay away, to express their disapproval of this kind of election by not turning up,” he told AFP.
At the last legislature polls in 2016, half the seats were directly elected and many of those standing were prominent democracy activists who are now jailed, have fled overseas or been disqualified.
Turnout for those elections was 58 percent.
– Loyalty vetting –
Hong Kong has never been a full democracy, the source of years of growing protests. But Beijing’s latest system gives residents even less of a say in who runs their city.
Under the new rules, candidates have to be vetted for their patriotism and political loyalty and only 20 of the 90 legislature seats are directly elected.
The largest chunk of seats — 40 — are picked by a committee of 1,500 staunch Beijing loyalists.
The remaining 30 are chosen by reliably pro-Beijing committees that represent special-interest and industry groups.
Of the 153 candidates who made it through the vetting process, only 11 were identified as “centrist” or “non-establishment” by local media.
Preliminary results from overnight counting showed none of those candidates had won enough votes.
The result will be a legislature stacked with government loyalist that looks much closer to the Chinese mainland’s rubber stamp law-making bodies.
“The tension between the authorities and the people will remain in place for a long time while the legislators won’t be mediators because they have to toe Beijing’s line,” Chung Kim-wah, from the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, told AFP. The result is a blow for Hong Kong and Chinese officials who called on residents to embrace a new political system that they say will restore order.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam sought to manage expectations ahead of Sunday, telling state media last week that a low turnout could indicate “the government is doing well and its credibility is high”.
Independent polling places her public approval rating at around 36 percent.
– Beijing visit –
Lam’s office announced she would travel to Beijing on Monday evening for three days of meetings with the central government.
Chinese state media portrayed the elections as a glowing success.
The official Xinhua news agency said the vote had crushed “lies from external forces while demonstrating the true will of the people in the Chinese city”.
Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which answers to a Chinese government office that sets Hong Kong policy, described the vote as “the most successful one since handover”.
Chinese and Hong Kong authorities were infuriated by boycott calls made by a growing number of overseas activists who have fled Hong Kong but maintain large social media followings.
“People do not want to vote for a rubber-stamp chamber and pretend everything is all right,” Nathan Law, a former lawmaker now living in Britain and who is wanted by Hong Kong authorities, tweeted.
In the run-up to Sunday, 10 people were arrested under a new law that criminalises inciting boycotts, mostly for social media posts.
They also issued arrest warrants for overseas activists who made such calls and threatened Western media outlets with prosecution for editorials critical of the new political system.",1,,,"{'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'Beijing'], 'GBR': ['United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'], 'HKG': ['Hong Kong'], 'PHL': ['Manila']}",diaspora_activation,['Beijing'],['Beijing'],['Beijing'],"['China', 'Beijing']"
Philippines,29186,mb.com.ph,2020-10-12T00:00:00Z,Manalo cites arbitral ruling on South China Sea; rejects other countries' claims,"The Philippines wants peace in the South China Sea in the present and in the future as it asserts, despite other countries’ contests, its rights over the waters by citing international law and the arbitral ruling made six years ago.
While expressing a positive outlook on the South China Sea, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Secretary Enrique Manalo also made a strong statement on Tuesday, which rejected any other claims that “undermine” the ruling.
According to Manalo, the Award, which is an affirmation of United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea’s (UNCLOS) dispute resolution mechanisms, ruled authoritatively that the historic “nine-dash line” claim of other countries “had no basis in law and is without legal effect.”
He did not name any country in particular, but the nine-dash line is being used mainly by China to assert its claim over the waters.
The Award, Manalo added, also “upheld the Philippines’ sovereign rights and jurisdiction in its exclusive economic zone.”
Citing the Award, Manalo tagged as “unlawful” certain actions within the Philippine exclusive economic zone that violated the country’s sovereign rights.
These included the large-scale reclamation and construction of artificial islands that “caused severe environmental harm in violation of international conventions,” the large-scale harvesting of endangered marine species that “damaged the marine ecosystem,” and the actions taken since the commencement of the arbitration that “had aggravated the disputes.”
For Manalo, the Arbitral Tribunal’s ruling on July 12, 2016 affirmed to the community of nations “that the rule of law prevails, and that stability, peace and progress can only be attained when founded on a rules-based legal order on the oceans, as it should be everywhere else.”
“The Award and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) are the twin anchors of the Philippines’ policy and actions on the West Philippine Sea,” he said on the 6th Anniversary of the Award on the South China Sea Arbitration
He asserted that the findings of the Award and the UNCLOS “are no longer within the reach of denial and rebuttal.”
He also said they “are conclusive as they are indisputable.”
“The Award is final. We firmly reject attempts to undermine it; nay, even erase it from law, history and our collective memories. At the same time, we welcome the support of a growing list of countries for the Award,” he said.
For Manalo, the Award even benefits the entire family of nations.
This is because the Philippines does “not see it as directed at any other country, near or far.” Rather, it sees “it as it should be seen: as favoring all which are similarly situated by clarifying definitively a legal situation beyond the reach of arms to change.”
“It puts this aspect of international law beyond the limit of prescription,” he said.
“And so we say once again: the present that we need and the future that we want is a peaceful South China Sea. The Philippines is committed to this for as long as it exists,” he added.",1,,,"{'PHL': ['Republic of the Philippines'], 'CHN': ['People’s Republic of China', 'South China Basin']}",diplomatic_mediation,['China'],['China'],['China'],['China']
