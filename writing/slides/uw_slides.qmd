## Overview

\

1. Introducing Machine Learning for Peace
2. Comparing MLP with other media corpora
3. Application 1: Forecasting Travel Warnings
4. Application 2: Studying Russian Influence

# Introducing MLP Infrastructure

## Background

- Event data are key for understanding political dynamics
- Media reports are the most comprehensive documentation
- Positive: AI/ML provides new tools to extract information from text
- Negative: Existing media corpora have poor coverage of domestic media outlets in developing countries
- MLP provides high-quality corpus and flexible text processing infrastructure


## High Quality Corpus

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Input: Online news**

-   400+ news sources
-   40 languages
-   120 million articles
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Data quality**

-   Focus on high-quality local sources (medium data)
-   Direct, human monitored scraping
-   *Much* better coverage than extant archivers/aggregators (GDELT, Wayback, Lexis Nexis, etc.)
:::
:::

**\
\
Output: *Monthly* data**

-   63 countries
-   2012 - last month 


## Detecting Civic Space Events in Text

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa)
-   Pre-trained on enormous corpora of data + transfer learning
-   Fine-tuned on double human-coded training data (n=9,875)

## Data Processing Pipeline

\

![](mermaid.png){fig-align="center"}


# Comparing MLP with Big Data Media Corpora


## Findings

- International media sources have limited, skewed coverage of events in developing countries
  + Event datasets that rely on global language sources will have major biases
- Accurate data collection from national news sources requires careful human curation
  + GDELT, Common Crawl, Internet Archive include major errors


## Importance of Domestic News

![](figure_6_indonesia.jpg){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
We ran shock detection algorithms to identify major events 
We picked the event-month with the highest volume of articles but 0 from international sources
widespread corruption takedown implicating a major businesswoman and her husband in the mining trade, the minister of agriculture, a state-owned construction firm, and finally a major firm in gold commodities. From what I can tell, these aren't all connected, but the only one that received coverage in the AP (that I can find) is the minister of agriculture being sentenced to 10 years in prison.
:::


## Importance of Domestic News

![](figure_3.jpg){fig-align="center"}
::: notes
- most of our news comes from national sources
- fundamental differences in the type of events covered by domestic and international sources
:::


## Importance of Domestic News

![](figure_4_alternative.jpg){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
event types sorted by the extent of international coverage, with national coverage stacked on top. We see that there are big differences in the types of events that are covered in international media compared to domestic media. International media is far more likely to cover acts of violence, whereas domestic media is far more likely to cover legal actions, election activity, corruption, protests, and cooperation

:::


## Importance of Domestic News

![](figure_5.jpg){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
slightly positive relationship between the volume of coverage and the correlation between domestic and international reporting, the correlation is low across all countries. For instance, in Turkey and India, two countries that receive a lot of international coverage, the correlation between national and international coverage is below 0.5
:::

## Lexis Nexis vs MLP 

**Countries where LN has zero local sources: 6/56**

-   Albania, Belarus, Kosovo, Jamaica, Angola, South Sudan

**Comparing LN on other metrics:**

-   Fewer languages: 17 vs 34
-   Slightly more local sources per country: 5.5 vs 5 (median; excluding MLP's regional sources)
-   Shorter, more sporadic coverage over time

::: notes
-   These counts are generous to LN because (a) they're calculated conditional on the country being in the data (we don't include 0 sources for the 6 countries they don't have) and (b) we don't include our 12 regional sources
-   LN has more sources overall, but they're concentrated in big countries like India
-   LN is super expensive, academics have restricted access
-   Next slides show that a pretty large share start in recent years
:::

## Challenges of Scraping

![](figure_1.jpg){fig-align="center"}


## Scraping Case Study

**Bangladesh**: easiest case for automated scrapers

- Massive volume
- Good web architecture
- 2/5 sources are in English

## Scraping Domestic Outlets is Tough

**GDELT**

- MLP: 2013 and 2015 
- GDELT: 2019 forward
- GDELT's best covered source: 2,100 articles/mo compared to 2,500 per month from MLP
- Broken links, redirects, duplicate articles, and advertising
- Restricts requests to one search every 5 seconds, so that scraping even a single source for the full time-period can take several days

## Scraping Domestic Outlets is Tough

**Internet Archive**

- Took nearly two weeks to collect URLs from a single source from 2019-2023
- Numerous irrelevant, broken, and duplicate links
- Less than half or urls were usable 


## Random Audit of 5 MLP Countries

**Task**

- Use algorithm to identify major events
- Use GPT to summarize 5 most important events
- Human check of location and event classification accuracy

**Results**

- 40 events detected from April - June 2024 (300 possible)
- Correct country: 34/40
- Correct event: 38/40

::: notes
- Use algorithm to identify major events
- Use GPT to summarize 5 most important events (from 1-1000 articles)
- Correct country for all events: 34/40
- Correct event for all top 5: 38/40
- Correct event for every top 5: 181/200

# Forecasting Travel Advisories

## Why Travel Advisories?

- Request from US State Department
  + High-level travel advisories trigger deployment of resources
  + Anticipating location, timing of warnings can help smooth budgets
- Travel advisories include political instability, natural disasters, health risks, etc

## Data

- Target: onset of a serious travel advisory
- Predictors: MLP data, indicator for continued advisories, years, time trend, Bayesian country encoding 

![](Picture1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Modeling

- Forecast Horizon: 3 and 6 months
- Model: LightGBM + Temporal CV
- Hyperparameters: Wide grid search for learning rate, proportion of features, depth of trees
- Evaluation Metrics: 
  + ROC-AUC: ranking months in test set
  + AUC-PR: optimal for imbalanced data
 
## Performance

## Performance

![](fuzzyROC6.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
Fuzzy' Metrics: Models are evaluated using a 'fuzzy' onset metric, which considers an onset as 1 for the month before, during, and after the actual event. This accounts for the daily nature of travel advisories versus the monthly granularity of the MLP data

# Tracking Foreign Authoritarian Influence


## Resurgent Authoritarian Influence?

\

1.    Introduce data on Russian and Chinese influence on developing countries
2.    Describe influence cross-nationally and over time
3.    Examine Russia's pre-invasion behavior


## Resurgent Authoritarian Influence?

**Background:**

-   Collapse of Soviet Union: less influence by autocracies
-   Recently, powerful autocracies becoming more assertive in foreign policy

**Foreign Influence**: 

- Actions by the government of an influencing country to affect the policies, capacity, or behavior of a target country to advance its own national interests

\

3.    Russia has dramatically expanded its sphere in recent years, challenging China's dominance

::: notes
1.    Russian influence is more concentrated in a geographic sphere of influence
2.    Spheres of influence are shifting over time. In recent years, Russia has expanded its own sphere of influence into the Sahel and North Africa, while also challenging China's dominance in Sub-Saharan Africa, and to a lesser extent, Southeast Asia. Interestingly, Russia's expansion does not appear to have spread in Latin America.

::: notes
-   Economic Power is the most prevalent theme in the majority of countries in each region and both spheres of influence. -   Growth in diplomacy after 2022 in the Russian sphere of influence and in places where Russia's share of influence saw the largest increases. 
-   This provides further evidence for an influence campaign by Russia beginning at roughly the same time as the invasion of Ukraine. Given the focus on diplomacy, this campaign appears aimed at bolstering international support from non-Western governments
