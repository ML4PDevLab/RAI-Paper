title: "Foreign Influence by Authoritarian Governments: Introducing New Data and Evidence "
# subtitle: Explore the data using our [Shiny apps](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/mlp-devlab/rai/) 
abstract: Policymakers are increasingly concerned about the revival of superpower conflict. Increased competition among great powers has been especially evident in the exercise of foreign influence, where Russia and China have increased their efforts to influence less powerful nations. To date, the absence of quantitative data has limited systematic investigation of this resurgence of authoritarian influence activity. We introduce a new, country-month dataset tracking reports of influence by Russia and China in over 60 aid-receiving low- and middle-income countries from 2012 through August 2025. We construct the data by applying large language models (LLMs) to an original corpus of more than 100 million news articles sourced from high-quality, domestic news sources and use it to describe trends in influence activity over time and across countries. Finally, we exploit the unique features of the data to test hypotheses about Russian influence activity in the months before the invasion of Ukraine. We document a dramatic pre-invasion surge in diplomacy and hard power reporting, with weaker evidence for economic power. In doing so, we show that this data is useful for both theory testing and foreign policy decision-making.

## Introduction

The third wave of democratization was accompanied by a spectacular decline in the international influence of authoritarian governments. Culminating with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the ascendance of advanced democracies resulted in pressure on smaller and poorer countries to liberalize both their economies and their political systems. However, the last 15 years has seen the most powerful non-democracies become both more autocratic and more assertive in their foreign policies [@diamond2020democratic]. This has included increased attempts by Russia and China to influence political outcomes in less powerful nations and secure strategic partnerships. Over this period, scholars and policymakers have voiced concerns about a resurgence of authoritarian influence, which have motivated high-level decision-making in foreign policy and major investments by Western country governments in strengthening ties with strategically important countries.
<!-- , ranging from the dissemination of propaganda targeting citizens' attitudes to technological support for governments seeking to suppress political competition -->

More aggressive foreign policy by Russia and China is happening amidst growing concerns about a "new Cold War" between Western democracies and the "new axis" coalition [@sanger2024new; @nss2017; @evans2019]. Despite the importance of these issues for foreign policy, the paucity of quantitative data on foreign influence has limited systematic investigation. Assembling data on foreign influence activity is difficult due to the absence of publicly available administrative data in both influencing countries and countries targeted for influence (which we refer to as "target countries"). Furthermore, while major events like military confrontations or trade agreements are covered widely in the international press, less dramatic developments are rarely reported by media outside target countries. This creates a measurement gap precisely where influence is most likely to be subtle, cumulative, and locally reported.

In this paper, we introduce the *Resurgent Authoritarian Influence (RAI)* dataset. *RAI* tracks monthly reporting across 21 influence categories indicative of foreign influence across `r num_countries` aid-receiving low- and middle-income countries from 2012 through August 2025. We focus on aid-receiving countries because these are the settings where influence efforts are most visible and where our domestic-source infrastructure provides the richest coverage. This focus is a scope condition rather than a claim about the universe of influence—aid is one tool within *RAI*, not the outcome. It comes at a cost—*RAI* is not designed to capture influence operations in advanced democracies—and we treat that as an explicit scope condition and a target for future expansion. To build the data, we apply a fine-tuned transformer-based language model to a novel corpus of more than 100 million news articles published by over 350 high-quality media outlets, most of them domestic, in nearly 40 languages. The result is a high-frequency measure of *reported* influence activity by tool and country, updated every 90 days. *RAI* is a media-based measure of reporting intensity (country-month shares of articles), not a record of verified actions or a traditional event dataset.

This paper proceeds in three parts. First, we introduce the *RAI* dataset and its underlying *High-Quality Media from Aid Receiving Countries (HQMARC)* corpus, documenting our translation, geolocation, and classification pipeline and clarifying the scope conditions and measurement choices. Second, we use the *RAI* data to describe how Russia and China vary the tools they use across space and time, presenting both absolute levels and relative shares to avoid misleading comparisons. Third, we provide a theoretically grounded use case by examining Russia's foreign behavior in the months leading up to its invasion of Ukraine. Drawing on research in international political economy and foreign policy, we derive expectations about why Russia would intensify Diplomacy, Economic Power, and Hard Power in advance of the invasion, while treating Soft Power and Domestic Interference as lower-salience or placebo categories. We then use change-point analysis and AI-assisted qualitative case studies to evaluate these expectations and to illuminate the developments and narratives that drive detected shifts in reporting.

The *RAI* dataset presents a valuable and timely resource for both academic researchers and policymakers. For researchers, the data enable tests of how influence tools substitute for or complement one another, and how shifts in influence strategies unfold around major geopolitical shocks. For policymakers, the data provide a transparent and updateable gauge of how influence is reported in target-country media, supporting early warning and comparative assessment across contexts. We emphasize that *RAI* measures *reporting* on influence activity—not verified actions themselves—and thus it is best interpreted as a high-frequency indicator of salience and attention within local news ecosystems. This framing is intentional: the data capture what local media choose to cover, not the full universe of covert activity.

<!-- We speculate that this behavior was a strategy to bolster diplomatic and military ties with receptive countries and mitigate blowback that would follow from their military aggression. In doing so, we provide one of the first quantitative investigations of an empirical claim driving high-level decision-making in foreign policy and international advocacy. -->

## Russian and Chinese Foreign Influence

In the period after the collapse of the USSR, Western academics and policymakers widely expected that the integration of Russia and China into international institutions and economic interdependence would lead to a convergence in their governing systems toward that of Western democracies [@sanger2024new; @fukuyama2015end]. However, over the past 15 years, Russia and China have increasingly asserted themselves on the global stage, signaling a commitment to the maintenance of their authoritarian governance models and a return to great power competition. Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008 and annexation of Crimea in 2014 signaled a willingness to redraw borders by force. Meanwhile, China has pursued assertive policies in the South China Sea, including the militarization of artificial islands, while advancing its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to extend its economic and political influence across Asia, Africa, and Europe. Both countries have also sought to undermine Western influence through cyber operations, strategic alliances, and propaganda efforts. These actions reflect a broader effort to challenge the liberal international order and reshape global power dynamics in their favor.

Influence strategies are inherently multi-dimensional. States can deploy coercive tools (e.g., military assistance, sanctions) or non-coercive tools (e.g., public diplomacy, cultural engagement), and can target elites or publics depending on objectives, costs, and constraints. This implies that changes in influence behavior are likely to be reflected not only in *how much* influence activity is reported, but *which tools* are emphasized and *where* they are deployed. A central goal of *RAI* is to make those shifts empirically visible.

This multi-tool framework yields testable expectations. If influence tools are complements, we should observe coordinated increases across diplomacy, economic engagement, and security cooperation in periods of heightened strategic pressure. If tools are substitutes, we should observe tradeoffs between coercive and non-coercive instruments depending on target vulnerability and political alignment. In the pre-invasion period, we expect Russia to intensify *Diplomacy*, *Economic Power*, and *Hard Power* reporting in countries with stronger economic dependence or closer ideological proximity, while *Soft Power* and *Domestic Interference* should exhibit weaker or null pre-invasion shifts. We treat the latter as lower-salience or placebo categories for the pre-invasion hypothesis tests.

Recent qualitative accounts underscore the importance of tracking these varied tools. For example, reporting on Russia’s growing footprint in Africa highlights the interaction of security assistance, political engagement, and information operations, including the evolving role of private or semi-private military actors and the Africa Corps/Wagner legacy [@ferragamo2023russias; @Gain2023; @Hairsine2023; @Reuters2024]. These accounts suggest that influence strategies often blend overt diplomacy with less visible security ties, motivating a measurement approach that distinguishes multiple dimensions rather than collapsing them into a single index.

Concerns about *RAI* are driving major policy decisions. For example, in 2019, the United States Agency for International Development launched the \textit{Countering Malign Kremlin Influence Development Framework} and the \textit{Countering Chinese Influence Fund} and listed both among its key accomplishments.\footnote{`USAID Key Accomplishments,' \href{https://www.usaid.gov/reports-and-data/key-accomplishments}{USAID}} Also in 2019, the Export-Import Bank of the United States announced the China and Transformational Export Program (CTEP) to help U.S. exporters facing competition from China in strategically important sectors. In 2022, the U.S. responded to a security agreement between China and the Solomon Islands by promising to reopen an embassy and invite Pacific leaders to Washington [@zongyuan2022china]. Similarly, the European Union established the Global Gateway scheme in 2021, allocating €300 billion for infrastructure investments around the world as a rival to China's BRI.

Despite the massive impact of Chinese and Russian influence operations, quantitative data remains rare. To date, the most comprehensive data comes from AidData. AidData provides detailed, project-level data on China's foreign aid and state financing to all low- and middle-income countries from 2000-2017 and annual records of diplomatic activity in a subset of countries in Asia [@goodman2024aiddata; @custer2021tracking]. While the existing data on Chinese influence has yielded valuable research and policy insights, it has several limitations. First, these data focus exclusively on Chinese influence. While China is the greater power, Russian influence has often proven more aggressive and destabilizing. Second, these data are updated sporadically, limiting their utility for understanding current events, emerging crises, or changes in the tactics of influencing countries. Third, these data focus on a limited set of the influence tools that Russia and China deploy to exert influence abroad. 

For this reason, research on foreign authoritarian influence has focused on economic power, including the impact of Chinese development assistance and foreign direct investment [@dreher2022banking]. This nascent literature has often pointed to China's use of aid and investment as a means of obtaining political support from, and increasing the political stability of, strategically important countries [@dreher2019african; @ma2018political]. Accordingly, China has pursued these objectives by strengthening incumbents with economic and political resources that can be used to spur development, reward supporters, or suppress opposition [@dreher2019african]. Recent work suggests that these forms of Chinese influence have been quite successful in their objectives, finding that Chinese aid and investment reduce conflict in recipient countries [@gehring2019china; @strange2017tracking], increase economic growth [@dreher2021aid; @knutsen2020political], increase government repression [@gehring2019china; @kishi2017chinese], decrease membership in trade unions [@isaksson2018chinese], undermine citizen support for democracy [@gehring2019china], and increase support for China among the citizenry [@dreher2024aid], except for those closest to the location of aid projects [@blair2022foreign].\footnote{Recent research also suggests that Chinese foreign direct investment promotes anti-China protests, particularly authoritarian countries [@kim2024money].}

Yet, *RAI* is broader than aid and development finance and encompasses a broad set of tools deployed for different objectives at different times and in different places. For example, Russia and China have wielded their economic and hard power to influence both regional and the international economic order [@goldstein2020china; @maier1977politics] and pursue overlapping economic and military cooperation with less powerful nations [@gowa1993power].\footnote{Yuras Karmanau. `Belarus, Russia announce retaliatory sanctions against EU.,' \href{http://web.archive.org/web/20201218102458/https://apnews.com/article/alexander-lukashenko-belarus-elections-europe-archive-24ce7c51f85b557531875e866b3fd6e1}{ AP}, October 2, 2020.} Better data can help illuminate the precise mechanisms through which deepening economic relations may translate into influence over the security policy of target countries [@lim2019money].
Similarly, Russia and China regularly use hard power, in the form of direct application of military capacity, security agreements, and defense cooperation, as tools of foreign influence.\footnote{Andy Wrong. `Understanding Russia's Foreign Policy Through International Arms Sales.,' \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20200502072626/https://wavellroom.com/2020/04/30/russian-foreign-policy-through-international-arms-sales/}{ Wavell Room}, April 30, 2020.} More granular data tracking these activities can help illuminate when powerful states seek defense cooperation, how they select defense partners, and the benefits that both parties seek from defense cooperation [@kinne2018defense]. 

Research has also been limited by a lack of data on the use of soft and diplomatic power [@nye2023rise; @kurlantzick2007charm]. We define soft power as non-coercive efforts to shape preferences among publics *and* elites, often through public diplomacy, cultural engagement, and information campaigns. Russia and China deploy these tools by establishing cultural centers\footnote{`Cultural Cooperation.,' \href{http://web.archive.org/web/20210506124214/https://embrusscambodia.mid.ru/web/cambodia-en/cultural-cooperation}{ Embassy of the Russian Federation in the Kingdom of Cambodia}.} and launching media campaigns.\footnote{Lorne Cook. `EU report takes aim at Russia over vaccine fake news.,' \href{http://web.archive.org/web/20210906061347/https://apnews.com/article/european-union-russia-europe-fake-news-coronavirus-d12316c1e6c21fe2f1a450e8f387dbac}{ AP}, April 28, 2021.}. Russia and China also promote their interests abroad using diplomatic maneuvers that strengthen their political allies, including formal statements and official visits to express support,\footnote{Maja Zuvela, Aleksandar Vasovic. `Beset by protests, Serb leader stages lavish reception for Putin.,' \href{http://web.archive.org/web/20210329160921/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-serbia-russia/beset-by-protests-serb-leader-stages-lavish-reception-for-putin-idUSKCN1PB2EO}{ Reuters}, January 17, 2019.} and participation in diplomatic mediation.\footnote{Helena Legarda. `China as a conflict mediator.,' \href{http://web.archive.org/web/20210826162927/https://merics.org/en/short-analysis/china-conflict-mediator}{ MERICS}, August 22, 2018.} Data tracking the timing and location of soft power and diplomatic engagement can produce valuable new insights into how and when non-coercive strategies influence target-country politics, and whether these tools are used as substitutes or complements to coercive forms of influence [@ku2022dark; @putnam1988diplomacy; @allan2018distribution].

Foreign powers also use domestic interference to create pressure on target governments [@lim2019money]. For Russia and China, this has included everything from surveillance and cyber-attacks\footnote{Steve Holland, Doina Chiacu. `U.S. and allies accuse China of global hacking spree.' \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20210919030118/https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-allies-accuse-china-global-cyber-hacking-campaign-2021-07-19/}{Reuters}, July 20, 2021.} to collecting intelligence on the political opposition,\footnote{`Uganda and Zambia rejects Huawei spying allegations.,' \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20210122183602/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-49368276}{ BBC}, August 16, 2019.} engaging in cyber attacks against independent news sources,\footnote{`Serbia's Independent N1 Portal Buffeted by Cyber-Attacks.,' \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20210722042755/https://balkaninsight.com/2020/01/31/serbias-independent-n1-portal-buffeted-by-cyber-attacks/}{ BalkanInsight}, January 31, 2020.} and transferring surveillance technology.\footnote{Stephen Kafeero. `Uganda is using Huawei's facial recognition tech to crack down on dissent after anti-government protests.' \href{http://web.archive.org/web/20210806182022/https://qz.com/africa/1938976/uganda-uses-chinas-huawei-facial-recognition-to-snare-protesters/}{ Quartz Africa}, November 27, 2020.} Many such activities are covert and therefore systematically underreported; *RAI* captures only the subset that enters local news, which we interpret as a lower bound on domestic interference activity. 

Finally, these attempts to exert influence can also have unintended consequences. For example, Chinese influence has been linked to increased corruption [@brazys2017bad; @isaksson2018chinese] and the spread of Chinese organized crime.\footnote{`Triad Societies and Chinese Organised Crime in South Africa.,' \href{https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/triad-societies-and-chinese-organised-crime-south-africa}{ U.S. Department of Justice}, September 2003.} Consistent with those findings, perceptions of excessive Russian and Chinese influence have caused anti-incumbent political mobilization in many countries.\footnote{`Georgia protests: Thousands storm parliament over Russian MP's speech.,' \href{http://web.archive.org/web/20210906144827/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48710042}{ BBC}, June 21, 2019.; Abu-Bakarr Jalloh, Fang Wan. `Resistance growing to Chinese presence in Zambia.,' \href{http://web.archive.org/web/20210817143241/https://www.dw.com/en/resistance-growing-to-chinese-presence-in-zambia/a-47275927}{ DW}, April 9, 2019.} Data on these adverse types of influence will allow investigations into the ability of Russia and China to effectively manage their influence operations.

As these examples illustrate, Russia and China use an impressive array of tools to exert influence. For several of these tools, their use is deliberately covert, rarely disclosed in official government records, and often only exposed through investigative reporting. Furthermore, *RAI* tools are often deployed sporadically in response to short-term contingencies such as domestic political crises in strategically important countries, rather than on a predictable, ongoing basis.\footnote{Siegle, Joseph. `Russia in Africa: Undermining Democracy through Elite Capture.,' \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20210928161602/http://democracyinafrica.org/russia-in-africa-undermining-democracy-through-elite-capture/}{ Democracy in Africa}, September 23, 2021.} These characteristics have made tracking *RAI* extremely challenging. 

In the next section, we describe a new dataset providing the most comprehensive information on these tools to date. By focusing on a broad set of tools, this data enables new investigations of key questions in international relations, including when and how states seek to cooperate with or control other countries [@kinne2013network; @lake1996anarchy], how states overcome mistrust and distributional conflicts to secure cooperation [@kinne2018defense], how the strategies of regional powers respond to changes in economic interdependence, multilateral institutions, and domestic politics in their neighborhood [@acharya2014power], and the consequences of interdependence and economic statecraft [@nye1990power; @krasner1976state]. Importantly, tracking the use of these tools at a higher frequency also enables a new focus on the role of medium and short-term changes in conditions, rather than long-term structural changes that characterizes much of the international relations literature.

*RAI* tracks *reporting* on 21 influence categories associated with Russian and Chinese foreign influence. Each category captures reporting on actions by a government or state-linked actor intended to shape another country’s domestic or foreign policy. We developed the category list by reviewing prior research and consulting with civil-society partners and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). We group the 21 categories into six broader themes and construct theme indices by summing category-level reporting intensities. Table \ref{rai_theme} lists the themes, definitions, and categories.\footnote{See Supplementary Materials *Category Definitions* for category-level definitions.}

**Measurement and Validation.** The classifier assigns category labels to article text and we aggregate those labels into monthly reporting indices. Because fine-grained categories are inherently noisier, our primary analyses focus on the six theme indices, which are more stable and policy-relevant. We report classifier performance, confusion matrices, and training details in the Supplementary Materials (see *Model Performance*), and we interpret category-level patterns with caution. *RAI* measures *reported* influence activity, not verified actions; the distinction is most important for covert behaviors (e.g., intelligence or cyber operations), which are likely to be underreported and should be interpreted as lower bounds.

**Media and salience considerations.** *RAI* draws on domestic and international media sources that differ in ideology, ownership, and editorial priorities. We cannot fully eliminate editorial bias, but we mitigate salience effects by normalizing by total article volume, presenting both absolute levels and relative shares, and grounding inference in within-country changes over time. Where possible, we show parallel figures for China and Russia rather than only shares to avoid misleading relative comparisons.

**Scope and coverage.** The dataset covers `r num_countries` aid-receiving countries from 2012 through August 2025, which is narrower than some existing global datasets. This is a deliberate tradeoff: it enables consistent, high-frequency measurement in contexts where domestic coverage is rich and influence activity is more visible. We treat this as a scope condition rather than a claim about the universe of influence, and we explicitly acknowledge that influence operations in advanced democracies are not captured here.

Articles that do not clearly fit any category are coded as `-999` in the underlying data and are used only to compute the total article denominator; they are not included in the category indices.

To collect reporting on our 21 influence categories, we built the *HQMARC* corpus, an original repository of online news covering `r num_countries` countries from 2012 through August 2025. *HQMARC* includes more than 100 million articles published by 16 international outlets, 12 regional outlets, and a curated sample of `r sum_lengths` high-quality domestic newspapers. We include two Chinese outlets (`scmp.com` and `xinhuanet.com`) and one Russian outlet (`themoscowtimes.com`) aimed at international audiences (see Supplementary Materials *Digital News Sources*). Domestic sources account for 95% of articles, regional sources 1%, and international sources 4%. We have a median of `r median(result_df$lsources_len)` and a mean of `r round( mean(result_df$lsources_len), digits = 1)` domestic sources per country (see Supplementary Materials *Distribution of Domestic Sources* for the full distribution).

To select domestic sources, we identify prominent online outlets using university library guides, Reporters Sans Frontieres country profiles, and publicly available media reports, and we add sources recommended by NGO partners, USAID country offices, and local civil society organizations. We conduct a desk review of each outlet's ownership and partisan affiliation by consulting reports on media ownership and press freedom in the outlet's country (see Supplementary Materials *Assessing Outlet Independence* for details). Because outlet ideology and ownership shape coverage, we intentionally include both independent and state-affiliated sources. For each country, we aim to have at least 50% of the news in our corpus from independent outlets; where this is not possible, we implement weighting to reduce the influence of heavily state-aligned ecosystems (see Supplementary Materials *Source Weighting* for details).

Rather than using generic crawlers or pre-canned scraping tools, we build custom scrapers and parsers to capture each outlet's complete publication history. This "medium data" approach yields higher coverage and stability than large aggregators such as GDELT, Common Crawl, or the Internet Archive. *HQMARC's* human-supervised scraping produces a corpus with a more stable, well-understood composition than widely used alternatives [@moratz2024tracking].\footnote{For each source, we develop and deploy a custom scraper to accommodate the website architecture and a custom parser to extract the publication date, title, and story text from each article. Depending on website architecture, we obtain news articles by scraping sitemaps, newspaper archives, or by simulating infinite clicking/scrolling using Selenium. In order to avoid storing the same article multiple times, we de-duplicate based on URL and title similarity for articles published on the same day. We update these scrapers on a quarterly basis to maintain accuracy and comprehensiveness.} We primarily rely on open-access or permissioned content; paywalled sources are underrepresented, which may bias coverage in some contexts.
<!--  -->

To accommodate a large volume of articles in diverse languages, we translate articles into English with open-source NMT tools and then extract locations and influence categories from the translated text. Given the well-documented biases in English-language news sources [@baum2015] even on relatively uncontroversial topics like natural disasters [@brimicombe2022], we include non-English newspapers in our corpus.\footnote{We use neural machine translations (NMT) through Hugging Face or OpenNMT to translate into English. We test the efficacy of all translation models by extracting sample text from articles published in each language and running the text through all available translation models on the Hugging Face open database. We then assess whether the translations are sufficient to identify the main influence category being reported on. If they are not, we compare the performances with those of our other APIs and choose the one that yields the optimal sentence-to-sentence translations with sufficient human readability.} See Supplementary Materials *Languages in HQMARC* for a list of languages by country.

To classify influence categories, we fine-tuned a ModernBERT-large classifier (`answerdotai/ModernBERT-large`) on a newly labeled dataset of 10,329 articles (22 labels including the `-999` outside-category class). We concatenate the translated title with the first two sentences of the translated main text, extend up to four sentences to reach a minimum length threshold, and then truncate to 256 tokens. We use class-weighted training to address label imbalance. We evaluate performance with 5-fold cross-validation and a held-out test set (15% of the data; $n=1{,}550$). Cross-validation accuracy averages 0.926 $\pm$ 0.008 and macro F1 averages 0.885 $\pm$ 0.013; macro precision and recall average 0.883 and 0.890, respectively. On the held-out test set, accuracy is 0.923 with macro precision 0.877, macro recall 0.893, and macro F1 0.883 (weighted F1 = 0.923). Performance is strongest for high-signal categories (e.g., intelligence/counterintelligence, cyber attack, joint security force exercise), with lower F1 scores for more linguistically diffuse categories such as diplomatic statements and policy interventions. For this reason, the main text emphasizes theme-level indices, while category-level patterns are treated as secondary and reported in the Supplementary Materials.
<!-- For Helsinki-NLP model, it’s roughly 600 characters for maintext and title. However, it depends on the huggingface models and the original language. Also, if it’s deep_translator that we use for specific languages, it’s 600 for maintext only. -->
<!-- we feed title translated and first two sentences of maintext translated. -->

Validation and benchmarking. We report out-of-sample performance and conduct targeted audits of change-point months, including qualitative checks of articles driving detected shifts. We also use well-documented episodes (e.g., coups and diplomatic recognition switches) as face-validity checks. Because *RAI* is based on reporting, it will understate influence activities that are never reported or are only disclosed years later; this is particularly salient for covert interference. We therefore interpret *RAI* as a high-frequency indicator of *salience in reporting*, and we treat cross-validation with external datasets (e.g., AidData for aid-related categories and GDELT for broad activity) as a priority for ongoing updates rather than a one-to-one substitute.

To identify foreign influence reporting involving Russia or China, we built a keyword library to detect mentions of Russian and Chinese agencies, companies, or officials. See Supplementary Material *Using Keywords to Detect Influence* for the keyword list, development process, and validation tests. To ensure that reporting is assigned to the correct target country, we geoparse the first 600 characters of text and identify all locations mentioned. If no country is found, we assign the article to the country in which the publishing outlet is based.\footnote{For international and regional outlets, articles are only assigned to a country if they explicitly mention a location within that country in the first 600 characters. To locate locations and identify those happening within a target country, we use the CLIFF-CLAVIN geoparser with the GeoNames ontological gazetteer. GeoNames is one of the most comprehensive and well-maintained sources of geographic data available, containing over 12 million unique location names across 250 countries [@dignazio2014cliff]. CLIFF API has detailed information on the locations detected, and we retrieve and convert the country codes of each location to assign the article to a specific location(s). We implement several corrections to the underlying CLIFF system, including overriding an error that assigns mentions of \enquote{West Africa} to Angola and the assignment of \enquote{Gaza} to locations named \enquote{Ghaza} in Algeria and Pakistan.}
<!-- we use 1200 for english language articles and all translated text for originally non-English articles. -->
<!-- For technical details on CLIFF, see: \href{https://github.com/mediacloud/cliff-annotator}{CLIFF Annotator}. \href{https://www.geonames.org/}{GeoNames} is a free, online database containing the names and location of populated places and geographic features all over the world. -->

Finally, we aggregate these data to the country-month level, normalizing the count of articles reporting on each influence category by the total number of articles published in that country-month. Because only a small portion of news coverage focuses on foreign influence, we report *RAI* activity as articles per 10,000 published in each country-month. The resulting measures are *shares of reporting*, not verified counts of discrete actions or incidents, and they capture how frequently each influence category is reported relative to overall news volume. We construct theme indices by summing category-specific reporting intensities within each theme (Table \ref{rai_theme}), and we also construct a total index that sums across all categories for Russia, China, and both influencing countries combined.

![RAI data production pipeline.](mermaid.png){#fig-mermaid fig-align="center" width="650"}

@fig-mermaid provides a graphic representation of the *RAI* data production pipeline. For each country, this process is repeated every 90 days. Quality assurance measures are in place at multiple steps in this process. Before processing, we confirm that translation worked as expected and check every source to ensure that the volume of articles and their distribution across days conform to past updates. After processing, we calculate correlations between old and new data and check a standard set of comparison visualizations.

## Describing Authoritarian Influence Using RAI Data

In this section, we describe *RAI* activity between 2012 and August 2025. Because *RAI* is a reporting-based measure, the figures should be interpreted as shifts in reporting salience rather than verified action counts; we therefore treat the analyses as descriptive and avoid causal claims. An abundance of high-profile cases illustrate major influence operations by both countries. For Russia, perhaps the most dramatic example has been the country's recent influence in the Sahel. In our sample period, three Sahel countries experienced coups d’etat that resulted in a reorientation of foreign policy away from the former colonial power, France, and towards Russia. This pivot was multi-faceted, including economic cooperation, pro-junta propaganda campaigns, and diplomatic engagement [@nadzharov2023franco; @Gain2023]. However, the most significant developments included the provision of military support, including the presence of Russian special forces in Niger and Burkina Faso and Wagner forces in Mali [@Hairsine2023; @Reuters2024]. 

@fig-sahel-influence plots reporting on Russian Hard Power activity in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Red lines mark coup months. In all three cases, reporting is relatively muted prior to the coup periods and then rises sharply around the coups, with sustained higher volatility afterward—especially in Mali (2021) and Niger (2023). These patterns are consistent with well-known shifts in security partnerships, though we interpret them as changes in *reported* activity rather than direct counts of discrete actions. See Supplementary Materials *High-Profile Influence Operations* for a figure combining all influence reporting into one index.

For China, a similarly dramatic example has been the effort to secure formal diplomatic relations from countries that maintain recognition of Taiwan. Since 2016, multiple countries have switched diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China (PRC), following intensive diplomatic efforts that often included promises of sustained engagement and economic cooperation [@Bock_Parilla_2024]. 

Our sample includes seven countries that switched recognition during the period (Burkina Faso, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Solomon Islands). @fig-prc-influence plots Chinese Diplomacy reporting in these cases. In each country, we observe clear spikes in reporting around the recognition months, followed by heterogeneous trajectories—some sustained, others more episodic. Consistent with the multi-dimensional nature of influence, related shifts also appear in Economic Power and Soft Power indicators (see Supplementary Materials *High-Profile Influence Operations* for a combined index).

These cases illustrate recent, high-profile efforts by Russia and China to exert influence over low- and middle-income countries and show how *RAI* captures these episodes in reporting. In the remainder of this section, we zoom-out to analyze broader trends in foreign influence across aid-receiving countries. To simplify the analysis, we break our data into two historical periods: 2012-2021 and 2022-2025 (through August 2025). We choose these periods because we see the nature of influence activity begin to change in the months around Russia's invasion of Ukraine. For higher-frequency visualizations, see Supplementary Materials *Dominant Themes at Higher Frequency*.

We present figures for which aggregation from the monthly-level to an average across our two historical periods is performed *after* normalization. This forces each country-month to be treated with equal weight within each historical period. We see this as a more conservative approach, because months in which there is very little activity contribute equally to months with high levels of activity, meaning that a change in the dominant influence theme in an individual country, or a change in the relative share of influence between Russia and China, cannot be driven by a few high-activity months. Instead, changes over time require broad-based shifts persisting across many months. This also hedges against measurement error caused by isolated articles being misclassified as foreign influence or assigned to the wrong country. This coding choice has no influence on the broader findings. Figures where aggregation is performed *before* normalization are available in Supplementary Materials *Descriptive Figures with Alternative Aggregation*.

We begin by using the six themes in Table \ref{rai_theme} to describe the most frequently reported-on tools used by Russia and China. Specifically, we calculate the most frequently reported-on theme for each country-period. This approach counts all classified articles equally, but we expect that influence activity will receive coverage roughly in accord with domestic significance, with more significant developments being covered by multiple articles published in multiple sources over multiple days or weeks.

@fig-map_dominant-theme shows the dominant *RAI* tool by country for two periods. The left panel captures reports of Chinese influence and the right panel captures reports of Russian influence. For China, Economic Power remains the most common dominant theme across countries in both periods, while Diplomacy becomes dominant in a growing subset of cases in 2022–2025. When pooling across countries at the monthly level, Diplomacy’s share of reported Chinese influence rises from `r cd1` (2012–2016) to `r cd2` (2017–2021) to `r cd3` (2022–2025), suggesting a gradual rebalancing rather than a wholesale shift away from economic tools.

For Russia, the distribution is more mixed. Diplomacy is frequently dominant, but Hard Power becomes more salient in several countries after 2022. Pooling across countries, the Diplomacy share increases from `r rd1` (2012–2016) to `r rd2` (2017–2021) to `r rd3` (2022–2025), while Hard Power shows a marked rise around the invasion period. These descriptive patterns are consistent with a shift toward more coercive tools in the 2022–2025 period, though they remain measures of reporting rather than direct counts of actions.

Next, we look at the share of all *RAI* reporting (both Russia and China) that is attributed to Russia. Again, this approach counts all classified articles equally; for example, an article reporting on a diplomatic statement by Russia would receive the same amount of weight as a report on a major transfer of technology by China. However, we expect that influence activity will receive coverage roughly proportional to its significance.

@fig-map_russia-influence-share plots Russia's share of total *RAI* reporting (Russia / [Russia + China]) for each country across periods. Because this is a *relative* measure, it is best interpreted as the balance of reporting between the two actors rather than absolute intensity. The map suggests that Russian reporting dominates in parts of Eastern and Central Europe and several Sahel countries, while Chinese reporting is more dominant in parts of Southeast Asia and across much of Sub-Saharan Africa. Latin America and North Africa appear more mixed. We therefore interpret this figure in tandem with the absolute-level plots below.

Second, we see evidence of shifts in *relative* reporting shares over time. In 2022–2025, Russia’s share of reporting increases in parts of the Sahel and North Africa, while China retains dominance in much of Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Because these patterns are compositional, we interpret them as suggestive and rely on absolute-level plots below for inference about magnitude.

These descriptive patterns correspond with popular narratives that highlight growing Chinese influence in Africa and Latin America during 2012–2021 and more recent accounts of increased Russian influence in Africa and Southeast Asia [@ferragamo2023russias; @kurlantzick2023russias; @gvosdev2016putin]. This correspondence provides face validity for *RAI*, while also underscoring the importance of cautious interpretation: salience in international discourse can still shape local reporting, even when category classification focuses on concrete categories and coverage is dominated by domestic outlets.

In summary, the descriptive patterns suggest a rising emphasis on Diplomacy in reported influence activity for both Russia and China, alongside a post-2022 rise in Russian Hard Power reporting. Economic Power remains central for China, though its relative prominence fluctuates. These results should be interpreted as shifts in *reported* influence activity rather than direct counts of underlying developments.

## Increased Russian Activity

In this section, we investigate whether the intensity of reported influence activity has increased over time. The share map above is informative but potentially misleading if both actors move in the same direction. @fig-plot_level-increase therefore plots absolute levels of reporting (per 10k articles) for Russia and China. The vertical dashed lines mark Russia's annexation of Crimea (March 2014) and the invasion of Ukraine (February 2022). Reporting on Russian influence spikes around both events, with a pronounced and sustained elevation after 2022. Chinese influence reporting is comparatively stable through much of the series but rises in the later period, including a marked uptick in 2024–2025. These trends underscore the importance of distinguishing relative shares from absolute levels.

Notably, there is a spike in Chinese activity in February 2020, as COVID cases accelerated. Indeed, there is little evidence of China systematically increasing foreign activities around COVID diplomacy, despite international concerns to the contrary. If anything, China seems to have withdrawn internationally in the face of the pandemic. For Russia, we see a sustained increase in influence activity in the year after their annexation of Crimea in March 2014. In 2022, we see a massive surge in influence beginning a few months before the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and continuing at an elevated level through mid-2023. Because aggregation from both the country-year to the influencer-year and from the monthly-level to an average across our two historical periods is performed *after* normalization, the visible increase in Russian influence was likely broad-based across many countries and months, rather than driven by intense activity in a small number of countries or months.\footnote{This coding choice has no influence on the broader findings. Figures where aggregation is performed *before* normalization are available in Supplementary Materials *Increased Russian Activity Figures with Alternative Aggregation*.}

To identify where increases in Russian influence were targeted, @fig-plot_period_levels plots the percentage change in average monthly *RAI* articles per 10,000 published articles between the 2012–2021 and 2022–2025 (through August 2025) periods. The distribution shows broad increases for Russia across a majority of countries, with especially large increases concentrated in the Sahel and in Nicaragua, which invited Russian Armed Forces to enter the country in 2022.\footnote{`Russian state TV calls on army to take up offer to set up forces in Nicaragua.,' \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20220624110926/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2022/06/russian-state-tv-calls-on-army-to-take-up-offer-to-set-up-forces-in-nicaragua.html}{Newshub}, June 22, 2022.} The pattern for China is more heterogeneous, with sizable increases in some cases alongside declines in others.

Interestingly, the percentage increase in articles reporting on Russian influence was weakly negatively correlated with the level of Russian influence in the first period (`r rc_list[1]`), suggesting that Russian influence increased most dramatically in places where Russia was not previously exerting influence. This surge was only weakly correlated with China's share of total influence in the intermediate period at `r rc_list[2]`, suggesting Russia was not aggressively targeting its new influence at places where China held disproportionate sway. Similarly, the increase in the percentage change of Russian and Chinese influence between the first and second period was only weakly correlated at `r rc_list[3]`, suggesting that both powers were increasing their influence in different countries. 


## Testing Expectations of Russian Influence Activity

By fall 2021, U.S. intelligence suggests that Russian President Vladimir Putin had made the decision to invade Ukraine [@sanger2024new pp. 237-240]. In response, the U.S. began attempting to convince skeptical European allies that this flagrant violation of international law was imminent and that a decisive international response would be necessary. We argue that Russia also likely used this window of opportunity to engage in strategic behavior designed to mitigate international backlash. Knowing that many aid-receiving countries would be pressured by the U.S. and its allies to isolate Russia, we expect that Russia increased foreign influence operations to strengthen their diplomatic, military, and economic ties with these countries in the months before the invasion.\footnote{We refer to these as theoretical "expectations" rather than hypotheses because they were not pre-specified before looking at the data. Specifically, we observed a large aggregate increase in influence activity during this period and only then generated theoretical expectations about why this increase would be driven by some themes and not others.}

Why would Russia focus on diplomatic, military, and economic ties? Powerful countries have a variety of influence tools to draw on in times of crisis or intensified geopolitical competition. Some of these tools target public attitudes or domestic politics in target countries, which may improve cooperation over the medium-term, but are unlikely to yield immediate concrete benefits. We argue that this applies to influence tools under the Soft Power and Domestic Interference themes. Soft Power tools are designed to engender more positive views of the influencing country among foreign citizens or mobilize publics around specific issues. While such tools may be useful in reducing long-term political barriers to cooperation or influencing short-term domestic policy decisions, they are less likely to secure immediate material cooperation at critical moments. Domestic Interference tools can influence domestic policies in foreign countries or alter the capacity of their incumbents. These tools may help achieve long-term changes in policy or even regime, but they are less useful when more immediate forms of support are necessary.\footnote{Because Backlash is not an intentional type of influence, we do not consider it here. To the extent powerful countries can control the level of backlash activity through stronger governance of their influence operations, we would expect efforts to limit these activities to increase.}

Alternatively, Diplomacy, Hard Power, and Economic Power tools are targeted at elites and can provide immediate incentives to secure cooperation and undermine international isolation. Diplomacy is a critical step for entering into formal commitments and can build trust between senior officials. Diplomacy can help strengthen bilateral relationships, reaffirm existing commitments, or secure new formal or informal agreements. Importantly, diplomacy can also be used to pre-emptively threaten consequences if target countries defect from agreements or cooperate with the influencer's geopolitical competitors. For these reasons, anticipatory diplomacy may help countries seeking to mitigate the effect of blowback from impending violations of international law. 

Economic Power tools can also provide powerful, direct incentives for leaders in target countries to cooperate. Aid, investments, and trade agreements can increase interdependence, which can make participation in sanctions more costly or even buy influence over the target country's security policy [@lim2019money]. Negative trade actions can also be used to threaten economic damage if target country leaders choose to align with geopolitical competitors of the influencing country. Similarly, Hard Power tools can also incentivize leaders in target countries to cooperate. Direct military cooperation can increase the prospects of increased trade with the influencing country [@gowa1993power], allow states to modernize their militaries, or result in security guarantees [@kinne2018defense]. Alternatively, military exercises can deter target states from cooperating with the influencer's competitors. The use of Hard Power tools can also improve the military preparedness of the influencing country. Participation in small-scale military conflicts has allowed powerful countries like Russia and China to gain combat experience and test new technologies and non-conventional measures [@goodson2023; @kagan2020]. These activities may be especially useful when preparing for offensive actions against a third-party. 

Importantly, these tools will be most useful when deployed *before* an influencing country engages in a major offensive action. Once military activities have commenced, resources will be diverted to the conflict, increasing the opportunity cost of foreign influence operations. This is particularly true for Hard Power and Economic Power, where military experience is most beneficial during preparation for a larger conflict and pre-emptively deepening economic ties with a target country can increase the costs of severance after conflict initiation. 

To test this expectation, we use change-point detection to identify countries for which Russia increased influence operations in the six months preceding the invasion. We choose to focus on six months because reporting suggests the decision to invade was likely already made by this point [@sanger2024new]. Change-point methods divide a time series into two segments where each segment has its own statistical characteristics [@fryzlewicz2014wild]. In this case, we focus on changes in the mean level of Russian influence activity for each target country across each of our six themes. This approach isolates the time period with the single largest level-shift in influence activity and then returns the month in which the increase began. Change-points identify the time period with the largest increase in influence activity for each country, which we call influence operations.
<!-- We investigate the nature and timing of Russian influence operations in the six months before their invasion of Ukraine.  -->

@fig-changepoint_themes presents evidence broadly consistent with our expectations. For Diplomacy, Hard Power, and Economic Power, there is a clear clustering of change-points in the six months before the invasion. To test this systematically, we count the number of countries with change-points for each six-month period and regress those counts on an indicator for the pre-invasion period. Across our six themes, this indicator is statistically significant for Diplomacy (`r p_dip`) and Hard Power (`r p_hp`), but not for Economic Power (`r p_ep`), Soft Power (`r p_sp`), or Domestic Interference (`r p_di`)—consistent with our expectation that the pre-invasion surge was concentrated in more overt tools. For change-point analysis of all *RAI* influence themes and to see each country with a change-point in the six months before the invasion, see the Supplementary Materials *Change-point Months for all Themes*.

For Diplomacy, `r cp_dip_pre` countries have change-points in the six months before the invasion, compared to `r cp_dip_prev5` over the previous five years (August 2016–July 2021; an average of `r cp_dip_prev5_avg` change-points per six-month period). For Hard Power, `r cp_hp_pre` countries have change-points in the immediate pre-invasion period, compared to `r cp_hp_prev5` over the previous five years (an average of `r cp_hp_prev5_avg` per six-month period). For Economic Power, we see `r cp_ep_pre` countries with change-points in the pre-invasion period, compared to `r cp_ep_prev5` over the previous five years (an average of `r cp_ep_prev5_avg` per six-month period).

To investigate the nature of these influence activities and confirm that these change-point months identify substantive, real-world developments, we conduct AI-assisted qualitative analysis. For each country-month in the GPT audit sample (change-point months from August 2021–January 2022), we pull all articles from the *HQMARC* database reporting on the relevant influence theme. This sample includes `r format(audit_articles, big.mark = ",")` news articles. We then prompt OpenAI's `gpt-4-0125-preview` to return a description of the most important developments being reported for each country-month. These summaries are used solely for audit and validation; they do not feed back into the *RAI* measures. Finally, we review each summary to identify whether the change-point was driven by misclassification or a genuine influence episode involving Russia in the target country. Because the change-point detection is rerun on updated data for the main analysis, we treat this audit sample as a fixed validation set rather than an exhaustive list of all current change-point months.

Importantly, the first month of level-shifts detected by the change-point analysis are usually not the month with the highest level of activity. Instead, these months are typically a period of slightly elevated activity preceding a noticeable and sustained increase (see Supplementary Materials *Change-point Months in Time-Series*). For this reason, these initial months are more likely to be composed of a small number of misclassified articles relative to subsequent months during the peak of activity. As a result, we believe this exercise provides an extremely hard test of the extent of measurement error in the dataset and, more generally, the dataset's ability to detect influence reporting from media and identify influence operations.

Within the audited Diplomacy change-point months, misclassification accounts for `r audit_dip_false` of `r audit_dip_total` change-point months before the invasion. In change-point months between August 2021 and January 2022, misclassification is driven by domestic news outlets reporting on geopolitics for Peru. Alternatively, genuine Russian influence activity in this period included talks on bilateral cooperation with Belarus, Benin, and Mali, a Russian diplomatic visit to the border between Kosovo and Serbia, and a celebration of diplomatic ties in Bangladesh. Diplomatic engagements with Ukraine accounts for the final change-point. Although we see some change-point months driven by misclassification, the number driven by real-world developments in the pre-invasion period is still well above the historical average.
<!-- Georgia denies entry to Russian opposition figure -->
<!-- Diplomats evacuate -->

Within the audited Hard Power change-point months, misclassification accounts for `r audit_hp_false` of `r audit_hp_total` change-point months before the invasion. In change-point months between August 2021 and January 2022, misclassification is driven by domestic news outlets reporting on security concerns/responses related to Russia's activities in a neighboring country (Senegal and Timor Leste) and Russia's broader geopolitical influence (Cameroon, Peru, and Bangladesh). Alternatively, genuine Russian influence activity in this period included agreements on military cooperation (Mali, Belarus), concerns about military activity in a neighboring country (Colombia), a joint military exercise (Angola), and the transfer of military technology and equipment (Burkina Faso, India). Again, although we see a number of change-point months driven by misclassification, the number driven by real-world developments in the pre-invasion period is still well above the historical average.

For Economic Power, misclassification accounts for `r audit_ep_false` of `r audit_ep_total` change-point months before the invasion, driven by domestic news outlets in Cameroon reporting on how Russian influence elsewhere in the world will impact the Cameroonian economy. The threat of retaliatory sanctions against Ukraine accounts for another change-point. Genuine influence activity includes a $620 million investment to prevent environmental damage from aluminum production in Jamaica, initial talks on major investments in Kenya's infrastructure to promote agricultural exports to Russia, and promises from a Russian parastatal to help Rwanda develop nuclear energy. Although evidence for increased use of Economic Power is less strong than the other themes, three genuine change-point episodes (excluding one misclassification and 1 episode targeting Ukraine) in the six months before the invasion is still higher than the average rate of `r cp_ep_prev5_avg` change-points per six months over the five preceding years. 

In summary, we find strong evidence that Russia increased foreign influence activities in the months before their invasion of Ukraine, especially in Diplomacy and Hard Power. Economic Power shows a smaller and statistically weaker pre-invasion surge. The reported influence activities underlying these trends appear consistent with attempts by Russia to shore-up bilateral relationships and encourage governing elites in target countries to maintain and deepen cooperation with Russia over the medium-term.  

Where would powerful countries target influence operations to most effectively mitigate blowback? We theorize three characteristics that might determine which countries were targeted for pre-emptive Russian influence operations. First, an influencing country might target countries that are ideologically similar. The leadership in ideologically similar countries may have higher baseline trust, easing communication and reducing the risks of sharing of sensitive information. If the countries' leadership are pursuing similar ideological goals, the target country may demand a lower cost for their cooperation in an effort to further common ideological objectives. 

Alternatively, influencing countries may perceive a lower risk of blowback from ideological partners relative to other countries. In this case, the influencer may pursue cooperation with more ideologically distant partners that would otherwise be highly likely to participate in international isolation of the aggressor. Similarly, influencing countries might seek to reinforce their ties with countries that have partnerships or ideological similarity to a mutual third partner. These ``friends of friends'' may be more likely to cooperate with competitors than direct friends, but still be easier to persuade than ideologically distant countries [@kinne2018defense]. 

Finally, an influencing country might target countries that are strategically important due to economic reliance. For example, countries that export commodities on which the influencing country's economy is heavily reliant and unable to produce domestically may be more likely targets for pre-emptive influence operations. Likewise, an influencer may target influence to deter isolation by countries that they want to export to. For this reason, we may see an influencer targeting countries that are large importers of commodities that the influencer relies on exporting to maintain economic stability or foreign exchange.

We operationalize ideological similarity using UN Ideal Point Distances [@voetendata]. For each target country, we calculate their average ideal point distance from 2017-2021 with Russia, China, and the Western Powers (U.S., U.K., and France). We treat the Western Powers as a single block because their ideal point distances with other countries are extremely highly correlated. Alternatively, ideal point distances from China and the West are strongly negatively correlated (`r cor_west_china`), distances from Russia and the West are weakly correlated (`r cor_west_russia`), and distances from Russia and China are strongly positively correlated (`r cor_russia_china`). Countries with lower values on their ideal point distance to Russia are considered ideologically friendly to Russia, those with lower values on their distance to China are considered friends of friends, while those with lower distances to the West are considered ideologically closer to Western powers.

We operationalize economic dependence by identifying commodities on which Russia is heavily reliant, either for imports or exports, and then identifying countries that trade in those commodities. We use comprehensive data on global imports and exports from UN COMTRADE from 2015--2023 (the latest COMTRADE coverage used in this update).

First, we define criteria to categorize countries as import-reliant or export-reliant on specific commodities. Second, we identify countries that are major exporters of commodities on which Russia is import-reliant, referred to as *Import-Reliance Exporters (IREs)*. Third, we identify countries that are import-reliant on commodities for which Russia is export-reliant, which we term *Export-Reliance Importers (ERIs)*. We define two variables: *Exporters* takes a value of 1 for countries that are *IREs* and 0 for all other countries; *Importers* takes a value of 1 for countries that are *ERIs* and 0 for all other countries. See Supplementary Materials *Operationalizing Economic Dependence* for a detailed discussion and figures describing how these categories are defined.

Our dependent variable is an indicator capturing whether the country experienced the onset of a reporting-based influence spike in the six months before Russia's invasion. Using OLS, we regress these on each independent variable described above. For each of the three focal *RAI* themes (Diplomacy, Hard Power, and Economic Power), we run one model with all independent variables excluding UN Ideal Point Distance (UNIPD) to China and one model including only UNIPD to China. We run separate models to avoid collinearity between UNIPD partners. Table 9 presents the results.\footnote{Our sample includes `r n_strategic` of the `r num_countries` countries in the *RAI* data. We lose `r num_countries - n_strategic` countries from the *RAI* sample due to missing COMTRADE data.} 

The clearest ideological pattern appears in Diplomacy. A one-unit increase in ideological distance from the Western powers ($range = 0.5$–$3.8$) is associated with about a 0.23 decrease in the probability of a Diplomacy change-point, while a one-unit increase in distance from China ($range = 0.08$–$3.1$) is associated with about a 0.32 increase. For Hard Power and Economic Power, ideological distance shows no consistent association; the only marginal pattern is a negative coefficient on distance to Russia in the Hard Power model. 

Turning to economic factors, the Importer and Exporter indicators are not statistically distinguishable from zero across models. Taken together, the results point to modest evidence of ideological targeting in Diplomacy, but limited evidence that trade dependence systematically shaped Hard Power or Economic Power targeting in this specification.

```

Taken together, these findings suggest that Russian pre-invasion diplomacy focused on countries closer to Western powers and relatively distant from China, while evidence for systematic targeting based on trade dependence or for Hard Power and Economic Power tools is weaker in this specification.

Our findings have several implications. These patterns may suggest strategic behaviors that precede offensive actions likely to prompt international blowback, such as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. While U.S. intelligence agencies were able to intercept Russian communications that clearly indicated an imminent invasion, this may not be the case for future conflicts. In such situations, an ability to quickly detect early indicators of an invasion could be valuable. Future research should consider whether similar behavior is apparent in advance of other episodes where a major power expected competitors to push for their isolation. Future research should also investigate whether pre-emptive influence operations paid-off by dissuading targeted countries from engaging in public criticism of Russia, reducing compliance with sanctions, or reducing support for condemnations in international forums.


## Discussion

This manuscript introduces the *Resurgent Authoritarian Influence (RAI)* dataset, a multi-dimensional, high-frequency measure of *reported* foreign influence by Russia and China in aid-receiving countries. *RAI* complements existing resources by extending coverage beyond aid and investment to include diplomacy, hard power, domestic interference, and soft power—dimensions that are often theorized but rarely measured together. This broader scope is a core contribution, even as it comes with a clear tradeoff in geographic coverage relative to single-domain datasets such as AidData.

We demonstrate the utility of *RAI* for both descriptive and inferential research. Descriptively, we show how the mix of tools varies across time and space: Russia’s reporting profile shifts toward Diplomacy and Hard Power after 2022, while China’s reporting remains anchored in Economic Power with a gradual rise in Diplomacy. Importantly, we present both relative shares and absolute levels to avoid misleading inferences from compositional measures alone. Inferentially, we develop and test expectations about Russia’s pre-invasion behavior, showing that change-points cluster in Diplomacy and Hard Power; Economic Power shows weaker evidence, and Soft Power and Domestic Interference do not show the same pre-invasion surge, consistent with our theoretical expectations.

These patterns provide new insight into how major powers shift influence strategies before high-risk foreign policy moves. We find suggestive evidence that Russia’s pre-invasion diplomatic outreach was more likely in countries aligned with Western powers, while evidence linking Hard Power or Economic Power targeting to economic dependence is limited in this specification. These findings illustrate how a multi-dimensional measure can reveal not just *how much* influence is reported, but *which tools* appear to be emphasized and *where*.

There are also important limitations. First, *RAI* is media-based and therefore reflects the salience of influence activity in local reporting rather than verified counts of discrete actions. Media attention is finite and subject to crowd-out during major crises; consequently, declines in one actor’s share do not necessarily imply declines in activity. Media capacity and press freedom vary across countries; we normalize by total output and balance sources, but cross-country comparisons should still be interpreted cautiously. Second, coverage is shaped by media ownership and ideology. We mitigate this by balancing independent and state sources and by weighting where necessary, but residual bias remains. Third, covert activities—especially in the Domestic Interference category—are systematically underreported, so *RAI* should be interpreted as a lower bound for those tools. Fourth, our scope is restricted to aid-receiving countries, which is a deliberate design choice but not a claim of global coverage. Finally, automated classification inevitably introduces some error, particularly around complex or multi-topic articles. Our workflow is designed for rapid retraining and targeted audits when shifts in coverage suggest drift.

We view cross-validation with external datasets as a priority for ongoing updates. Where categories overlap (e.g., aid and investment in AidData, broad activity in GDELT), *RAI* offers complementary information by relying on curated sources and full-text classification across a wider range of influence tools. These differences underscore *RAI’s* value as a distinct measurement strategy rather than a substitute for existing datasets.

In sum, *RAI* marks a critical step forward in understanding authoritarian influence in the modern geopolitical landscape. As great power competition intensifies, the ability to track and analyze influence activity at high frequency—and across multiple tools—will be vital. For scholars, *RAI* enables new tests of tool substitution, complementarity, and strategic sequencing. For policymakers, it provides a transparent and updateable measure of how influence is reported in target-country media. Our infrastructure is designed for quarterly updates and adaptation to additional actors and influence categories as global dynamics evolve.

<!-- The *RAI* dataset presents a valuable and timely resource for both academic researchers and policymakers. For researchers, this dataset offers a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of global power politics, enabling a deeper understanding of how Russia and China employ different tools. By uncovering patterns, trends, and correlations in their influence efforts, scholars will be able to make inferences about the underlying motives, mechanisms, and consequences of influence operations. Furthermore, this dataset can aid policymakers in crafting diplomatic and strategic approaches that align with ever-changing geopolitical realities, enhancing the ability to anticipate or mitigate the influence exerted by these countries. Thus, this dataset stands as a powerful tool for both academic research and effective policy formulation in an increasingly complex international arena. -->
